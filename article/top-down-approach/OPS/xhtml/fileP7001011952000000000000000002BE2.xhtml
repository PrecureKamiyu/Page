The call is routed from the correspondent through the PSTN to the home MSC in the mobile’s home network. This is the first leg of the call.</p></li>

When a mobile telephone is switched on or enters a part of a visited network that is covered by a new VLR, the mobile must register with the visited network. This is done through the exchange of signaling messages between the mobile and the VLR. The visited VLR, in turn, sends a location update request message to the mobile’s HLR. This message informs the HLR of either the roaming number at which the mobile can be contacted, or the address of the VLR (which can then later be queried to obtain the mobile number). As part of this exchange, the VLR also obtains subscriber information from the HLR about the mobile and determines what services (if any) should be accorded the mobile user by the visited network.</p>

Note that a handoff between base stations results not only in the mobile transmitting/receiving to/from a new base station, but also in the rerouting of the ongoing call from a switching point within the network to the new base station. Let’s initially assume that the old and new base stations share the same MSC, and that the rerouting occurs at this MSC.</p>

This congestion may be alleviated by handing off mobiles to less congested nearby cells.</p>

Handoff in GSM is initiated by the old base station based on these measurements, the current loads of mobiles in nearby cells, and other factors <a class="biblioref" href="fileP70010119520000000000000000037E0.xhtml#P7001011952000000000000000003A5E" data-foobar="7">[Mouly 1992]</a>.

When a mobile moves from the coverage area of one MSC to another, the ongoing call is rerouted from the anchor MSC to the new visited MSC containing the new base station. Thus, at all times there are at most three MSCs (the home MSC, the anchor MSC, and the visited MSC) between the correspondent and the mobile. <a class="xref" href="#P7001011952000000000000000002C34" data-foobar="1"><span class="label">Figure</span> <span class="number">7.33</span></a> illustrates the routing of a call among the MSCs visited by a mobile user.</p>

Such MSC chaining can in fact occur in IS-41 cellular networks, with an optional path minimization step to remove MSCs between the anchor MSC and the current visited MSC <a class="biblioref" href="fileP70010119520000000000000000037E0.xhtml#P7001011952000000000000000003A33" data-foobar="7">[Lin 2001]</a>.</p>
