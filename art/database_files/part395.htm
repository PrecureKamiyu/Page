In addition, a number of these tools are available on cloud platforms. Google File System (<span class="s44">GFS</span>) was an early generation parallel ﬁle system. Apache <span class="s44">HDFS </span>(<span class="s49">hadoop.apache.org</span>) is a widely used distributed ﬁle system implementation mod- eled after <span class="s44">GFS</span>. <span class="s44">HDFS </span>by itself does not deﬁne any internal format for ﬁles, but Hadoop implementations today support several optimized ﬁle formats such as Sequence ﬁles (which allow binary data), Avro (which supports semi-structured schemas) and Par- quet and Orc (which support columnar data representation). Hosted cloud storage systems include the Amazon S3 storage system (<span class="s49">aws.amazon.com/s3</span>) and Google Cloud Storage (<span class="s49">cloud.google.com/storage</span>).</p><p style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">Google’s Bigtable was an early generation parallel data storage system, ar- chitected as a layer on top of <span class="s44">GFS</span>. Amazon’s Dynamo is an early generation parallel key-value store which is based on the idea of consistent hashing, de- veloped initially for peer-to-peer data storage. Both are available hosted on the cloud as Google Bigtable (<span class="s49">cloud.google.com/bigtable</span>) and Amazon DynamoDB (<span class="s49">aws.amazon.com/dynamodb</span>). Google Spanner (<span class="s49">cloud.google.com/spanner</span>) is a hosted storage system that provides extensive transactional support. Apache HBase (<span class="s49">hbase.apache.org</span>) is a widely used open-source data storage sys- tem which is based on Bigtable and is implemented as a layer on top of <span class="s44">HDFS</span>. Apache Cassandra (<span class="s49">cassandra.apache.org</span>) which was developed at Face- book, Voldemort (<span class="s49">www.project-voldemort.com</span>) developed at LinkedIn, MongoDB (<span class="s49">www.mongodb.com</span>), CouchDB (<span class="s49">couchdb.apache.org</span>) and Riak (<span class="s49">basho.com</span>) are all open-source key-value stores. MongoDB and CouchDB use the JSON format for storing data. Aerospike (<span class="s49">www.aerospike.com</span>) is an open-source data storage system optimized for Flash storage. There are many other open-source parallel data storage systems available today.</p><p style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">Commercial parallel database systems include Teradata, Teradata Aster Data, IBM Netezza, and Pivotal Greenplum. IBM Netezza, Pivotal Greenplum, and Teradata Aster Data all use <span class="s44">P</span>ostgre<span class="s44">SQL </span>as the underlying database, running independently on each node; each of these systems builds a layer on top, to partition data, and parallelize query processing across the nodes.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part394.htm">&lt; 上一个</a><span> | </span><a href="../database.html">内容</a><span> | </span><a href="part396.htm">下一个 &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
