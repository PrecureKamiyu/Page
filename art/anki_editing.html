		<h1>Why Anki?</h1>
		<p><s>Because Anki is simple.</s></p>
		<p>Okay I lied. Anki supports TeX. That is so freaking cool. And it support MathJax and it support html. </p>
		<p>I recommand have some prequistion of html before editing the content of Anki card.</p>
		<h1>LaTeX in Anki</h1> 
		<p>It is a pitty that Anki does not support TeX, but maybe there is some 
		plugin to that. Anyway, the compiler is LaTeX and Anki use <code>dvisvgm</code> to convert the <code>.dvi</code> file to <code>.svg</code> file 
		and the letter is displayed when you browsing the 
		card. Neat.</p>
		<h2>Install</h2>
		<p>You need to install the TeX live. You may only install 
		latex and plain tex which only require space about <code>200 MB</code>. You may install <code>dvisvgm</code> manually using the TeX live manager.</p>
		<h2>Use</h2>
		<p>The relative code is in the templates of the cards. You may 
		change it to import package or define some macros. </p>
		<p>You can use <code>standalone</code> document class to produce a neat piece of latex output. </p>
		<h1>A universal solution to editing</h1>
		<p>By default, one could only use the interior text-piece-of-shit-editor to edit the content of the card or the html code of it.</p>
		<p>However, you may use <a href="https://www.listary.com/text-editor-anywhere" target="_blank">text editor anywhere</a> to solve this problem once for all.</p>
