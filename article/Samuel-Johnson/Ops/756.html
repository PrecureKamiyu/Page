<p class="p21">I.i.31 (342,2)</p>
<p class="p26">[To love, to wealth, to pomp, I pine and die;<br/>With all these, living in philosophy]</p>
<p class="p24">The stile of the rhyming scenes in this play is often entangled and obscure. I know not certainly to what <span class="t8">all these</span> is to be referred; I suppose he means, that he finds <span class="t8">love</span>, <span class="t8">pomp</span>, and <span class="t8">wealth</span> in <span class="t8">philosophy</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">I.i.75 (344,4) [while truth the while Doth falsly blind] <span class="t8">Falsly</span> is here, and in many other places, the same as <span class="t8">dishonestly</span> or <span class="t8">treacherously</span>. The whole sense of this gingling declamation is only this, that <span class="t8">a man by too close study may read himself blind</span>, which might have been told with less obscurity in fewer words.</p>
<p class="p24">I.i.82 (344,5)</p>
<p class="p26">[Who dazzling so, that eye shall be his heed,<br/>And give him light, that it was blinded by]</p>
<p class="p24">This is another passage unnecessarily obscure: the meaning is, that when he <span class="t8">dazzles</span>, that is, has his eye made weak, <span class="t8">by fixing his eye upon a fairer eye, that</span> fairer <span class="t8">eye shall be his heed</span>, his <span class="t8">direction</span> or <span class="t8">lode-star</span>,(See Midsummer-Night&rsquo;s Dream) [<span class="t8">and give him light that was blinded by it</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">I.i.92 (345,6)</p>
<p class="p26">[Too much to know, is, to know nought but fame;<br/>And every godfather can give a name]</p>
<p class="p24">[W: &ldquo;shame&rdquo; or &ldquo;feign&rdquo;] That there are <span class="t8">two ways of setting</span> a passage <span class="t8">right</span> gives reason to suspect that there may be a third way better than either. The first of these emendations <span class="t8">makes a fine sense</span>, but will not unite with the next line; the other makes a sense less fine, and yet will not rhyme to the correspondent word. I cannot see why the passage may not stand without disturbance. <span class="t8">The consequence</span>, says Biron, <span class="t8">of too much knowledge</span>, is not any real solution of doubts, but mere empty <span class="t8">reputation</span>. That is, <span class="t8">too much knowledge gives only fame, a name which every godfather can give likewise</span>. (1773)</p>
<p class="p24">I.i.95 (345,7) [Proceeded well to stop all good proceeding] To <span class="t8">proceed</span> is an academical term, meaning, <span class="t8">to take a degree</span>, as <span class="t8">he</span> proceeded <span class="t8">bachelor in physick</span>. The sense is, <span class="t8">he has taken his degrees on the art of hindering the degrees of others</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">I.i.153 (348,1) [Not by might master&rsquo;d, but by especial grace] Biron, amidst his extravagancies, speaks with great justness against the folly of vows. They are made without sufficient regard to the variations of life, and are therefore broken by some unforeseen necessity. They proceed commonly from a presumptuous confidence, and a false estimate of human power.</p>
<p class="p24">I.i.159 (349,2) [Suggestions] Temptations.</p>
<p class="p24">I.i.162 (349,3) [quick recreation] Lively sport, spritely diversion.</p>
<p class="p24">I.i.169 (349,4)</p>
<p class="p26">[A man of complements, whom right and wrong<br/>Have chose as umpire of their mutiny]</p>
<p class="p24">This passage, I believe, means no more than that Don Armado was a man nicely versed in ceremonial distinctions, one who could distinguish in the most delicate questions of honour the exact boundaries of right and wrong. <span class="t8">Compliment</span>, in Shakespeare&rsquo;s time, did not signify, at least did not only signify verbal civility, or phrases of courtesy, but according to its original meaning, the trapping, or ornamental appendages of a character, in the same manner, and on the same principles of speech with <span class="t8">accomplishment. Compliment</span> is, as Arwado well expresses it, <span class="t8">the varnish of a complete man</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">I.i.174 (350,6) [in the world&rsquo;s debate] The <span class="t8">world</span> seems to be used in a monastick sense by the king, now devoted for a time to a monastic life. <span class="t8">In the world, in seculo</span>, in the bustle of human affairs, from which we are now happily sequestred, <span class="t8">in the world</span>, to which the votaries of solitude have no relation.</p>
<p class="p24">I.i.252 (353,1) [<span class="t8">base minow of thy mirth</span>] A <span class="t8">minnow</span> is a little fish which cannot be intended here. We may read, <span class="t8">the base</span> minion <span class="t8">of thy mirth</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">I.ii.5 (355,2) [dear imp] <span class="t8">Imp</span> was anciently a term of dignity. Lord Cromwell in his last letter to Henry VIII. prays for <span class="t8">the</span> imp <span class="t8">his son</span>. It is now used only in contempt or abhorrence; perhaps in our authour&rsquo;s time it was ambiguous, in which state it suits well with this dialogue.</p>
<p class="p24">I.ii.36 (356,3) [crosses love not him] By <span class="t8">crosses</span> he means money. So in As you like it, the Clown says to Celia, <span class="t8">if I should bear you, I should bear no cross</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">I.ii.150 (360,7) [<span class="t8">Jaq</span>. Fair weather after you! <span class="t8">Dull</span>. Come, Jaquenetta, away]</p>
<p class="p24">[Theobald had reassigned two speeches] Mr. Theobald has endeavoured here to dignify his own industry by a very slight performance. The folios all read as he reads, except that instead of naming the persons they give their characters, enter <span class="t8">Clown, Constable, and Wench</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">I.ii.168 (361,8) [It is not for prisoners to be silent in their words] I suppose we should read, it is not for prisoners to be silent in their <span class="t8">wards</span>, that is, in <span class="t8">custody</span>, in the <span class="t8">holds</span>.</p>
<p class="p26">I.ii.183 (361,9) [The first and second cause will not serve my turn]<br/>See the last act of As you like it, with the notes.</p>
<p class="p24">II.i.15 (362,1)</p>
<p class="p26">[Beauty is bought by judgment of the eye,<br/>Not utter&rsquo;d by base sale of chapmen&rsquo;s tongues]</p>
<p class="p24">Chapman here seems to signify the <span class="t8">seller</span>, not, as now commonly, the <span class="t8">buyer</span>. <span class="t8">Cheap</span> or <span class="t8">cheping</span> was anciently the <span class="t8">market</span>, <span class="t8">chapman</span> therefore is <span class="t8">marketman</span>. The meaning is, that <span class="t8">that the estimation of beauty depends not on the</span> uttering or <span class="t8">proclamation of the seller, but on the eye of the buyer</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">II.i.45 (363,2) [Well fitted] is <span class="t8">well qualified</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">II.i.49 (363,3) [match&rsquo;d with] is <span class="t8">combined</span> or <span class="t8">joined</span> with.</p>
<p class="p24">II.i.105 (365,4) [&rsquo;Tis deadly sin to keep that oath, my lord; And sin to break it] Sir T. Hammer reads,</p>
<p class="p24">Not <span class="t8">sin to break it</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">I believe erroneously. The Princess shews an inconvenience very frequently attending rash oaths, which, whether kept or broken, produce guilt.</p>
<p class="p24">II.i.203 (369,6) [God&rsquo;s blessing on your beard!] That is, mayst thou have sense and seriousness more proportionate to thy beard, the length of which suits ill with such idle catches of wit.</p>
<p class="p24">II.i.223 (370,7) [My lips are no common, though several they be] <span class="t8">Several</span>, is an inclosed field of a private proprietor, so Maria says, <span class="t8">her lips</span> are <span class="t8">private property</span>. Of a lord that was newly married one observed that he grew fat; Yes, said sir Walter Raleigh, any beast will grow fat, if you take him from the <span class="t8">common</span> and graze him in the <span class="t8">several</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">II.i.238 (370,8) [His tongue, all impatient to speak and not see] That is, <span class="t8">his tongue being impatiently desirous to see as well as</span> <span class="t8">speak</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">II. i. 241 (370,9) [To feel only looking] Perhaps we may better read, <span class="t8">To</span> feed <span class="t8">only</span> by <span class="t8">looking</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">II. i. 262 (371,1) [<span class="t8">Boyet</span>. You are too hard for me] [Theobald did not end Act II here] Mr. Theobald has reason enough to propose this alteration, but he should not have made it in his book without better authority or more need. I have therefore preserved his observation, but continued the former division.</p>
<p class="p24">III.i (372,2) [<span class="t8">Enter Armado, and Moth.</span>] In the folios the direction is, <span class="t8">enter Braggart and Moth</span>, and at the beginning of every speech of Armado stands <span class="t8">Brag</span>, both in this and the foregoing scene between him and his boy. The other personages of this play are likewise noted by their characters as often as by their names. All this confusion has been well regulated by the later editors.</p>
<p class="p24">III.i.3 (372,3) [Concolinel] Here is apparently a song lost.</p>
<p class="p24">III. i. 22 (373,5) [These are complements] Dr. Warburton has here changed <span class="t8">complements</span> to <span class="t8">&lsquo;complishments</span>, for accomplishments, but unnecessarily.</p>
<p class="p24">III. i. 32 (374,8) [but a colt] <span class="t8">Colt</span> is a hot, mad-brained, unbroken young fellow; or sometimes an old fellow with youthful desires.</p>
<p class="p24">III. i. 62 (375,9) [You are too swift, Sir, to say so] How is he too swift for saying that lead is slow? I fancy we should read, as well to supply the rhyme as the sense,</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">You are too swift, sir, to say so, so soon Is that lead slow, sir, which is fir&rsquo;d from a gun?</span></p>
<p class="p24">III. i. 68 (375,1) [By thy favour, sweet welkin] Welkin is the sky, to which Armado, with the false dignity of a Spaniard, makes an apology for sighing in its face.</p>
<p class="p24">III. i. 73 (376,3) [no salve in the male, Sir] The old folio reads, <span class="t8">no salve in</span> thee <span class="t8">male, sir</span>, which, in another folio, is, <span class="t8">no salve, in the male, sir</span>. What it can mean is not easily discovered: if <span class="t8">mail</span> for a <span class="t8">packet</span> or <span class="t8">bag</span> was a word then in use, <span class="t8">no salve in the mail</span> may mean, no salve in the mountebank&rsquo;s budget. Or shall we read, <span class="t8">no enigma, no riddle, no l&rsquo;envoy &mdash; in the</span> vale, <span class="t8">sir &mdash; O, sir. plantain</span>. The matter is not great, but one would wish for some meaning or other.</p>
<p class="p24">III. i.112 (377,5) [how was there a Costard broken in a shin?] <span class="t8">Costard</span> is the name of a species of apple.</p>
<p class="p24">III. i.136 (378,7) [my in-cony Jew] [W. jewel] I know not whether it be fit, however specious, to change <span class="t8">Jew</span> to <span class="t8">jewel</span>. <span class="t8">Jew</span>, in our author&rsquo;s time, was, for whatever reason, apparently a word of endearment. So in Midsummer-Night&rsquo;s Dream,</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Most tender Juvenile, and eke most lovely</span> Jew. (see 1765, II,144,9)</p>
<p class="p24">III.i.182 (381,2) [This signior Junto&rsquo;s giant-dwarf. Don Cupid] Mr. Upton has made a very ingenious conjecture on this passage. He reads,</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">This signior</span> Julio&rsquo;s <span class="t8">giant-dwarf</span> &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">Shakespeare, says he, intended to compliment Julio Romano, who drew Cupid in the character of a giant-dwarf. Dr. Warburton thinks, that by Junio is meant youth in general.</p>
<p class="p24">III.i.188 (382,3) [Of trotting paritors] An <span class="t8">apparitor</span>, or <span class="t8">paritor</span>. is an officer of the bishop&rsquo;s court who carries out citations; as citations are most frequently issued for fornication, the <span class="t8">paritor</span> is put under Cupid&rsquo;s government.</p>
<p class="p24">III.i.189 (382,4)</p>
<p class="p26">[And I to be a corporal of his field,<br/>And wear his colours! like a tumbler&rsquo;s hoop!]</p>
<p class="p24">The conceit seems to be very forced and remote, however it be understood. The notion is not that the <span class="t8">hoop wears colours</span>, but that the colours are worn as a <span class="t8">tumbler</span> carries his <span class="t8">hoop</span>, hanging on one shoulder and falling under the opposite arm.</p>
<p class="p24">III.i.207 (383,5) [Some men must love my lady, and some Joan] To this line Mr. Theobald extends his second act, not injudiciously, but, as was before observed, without sufficient authority.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.i.19 (384,6) [Here, &mdash; good my glass] To understand how the princess has her glass so ready at hand in a casual conversation, it must be remembered that in those days it was the fashion among the French ladies to wear a looking-glass,&rsquo; as Mr. Bayle coarsely represents it, <span class="t8">on their bellies</span>; that is, to have a small mirrour set in gold hanging at the girdle, by which they occasionally viewed their faces or adjusted their hair.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.i.35 (385,8) [that my heart means no ill] [W: tho&rsquo;] <span class="t8">That my heart means no ill</span>, is the same with <span class="t8">to whom my heart means no ill</span>; the common phrase suppresses the particle, as <span class="t8">I mean him</span> [not <span class="t8">to</span> him] <span class="t8">no harm</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.i.41 (386,9) [a member of the commonwealth] Here, I believe, is a kind of jest intended; a member of the <span class="t8">common</span>-wealth is put for one of the <span class="t8">common</span> people, one of the meanest.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.i.49 (386,1)</p>
<p class="p26">[An&rsquo; your waist, mistress, were as slender as my wit,<br/>One o&rsquo; these maids girdles for your waist should be fit]</p>
<p class="p24">[W: my waste … your wit … my waste] This conjecture is ingenious enough, but not well considered. It is plain that the ladies girdles would not fit the princess. For when she has referred the clown to <span class="t8">the thickest and the tallest</span>, he turns immediately to her with the blunt apology, <span class="t8">truth is truth</span>; and again tells her, <span class="t8">you are the thickest here</span>. If any alteration is to be made, I should propose,</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">An&rsquo; your waist, mistress, were as slender as</span> your <span class="t8">wit</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">This would point the reply; but perhaps he mentions the slenderness of his own wit to excuse his bluntness.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.i.59 (387,3) [Break the neck of the wax] Still alluding to the capon.</p>
<p class="p26">IV.i.65 (388,5) [<span class="t8">king</span> Cophetua] This story is again alluded to in<br/>Henry IV.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Let king Cophetua know the truth thereof.</span></p>
<p class="p24">But of this king and beggar, the story, then doubtless well known, is, I am afraid, lost. Zenelophon has not appearance of a female name, but since I know not the true none, it is idle to guess.</p>
<p class="p26">IV.i.99 (389,7) [ere while] Just now; a little while ago. So<br/>Raleigh,</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Here lies Hobbinol our shepherd</span>, while e&rsquo;er.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.i.108 (390,9) [Come, lords, away] Perhaps the Princess said rather,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&mdash; <span class="t8">Come</span>, ladies, <span class="t8">away</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">The rest of the scene deserves no care.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.ii (392,2) [<span class="t8">Enter Dull, Holofernes, and Sir Nathaniel</span>] I am not of the learned commentator&rsquo;s [Wurburton] opinion, that the satire of Shakespeare is so seldom personal. It is of the nature of personal invectives to be soon unintelligible; and the authour that gratifies private malice, <span class="t8">aniuam in vulnere ponit</span>, destroys the future efficacy of his own writings, and sacrifices the esteem of succeeding times to the laughter of a day. It is no wonder, therefore, that the sarcasms, which, perhaps, in the authour&rsquo;s time, <span class="t8">set the</span> playhouse <span class="t8">in a roar</span>, are now lost among general reflections. Yet whether the character of Holofernes was pointed at any particular man, I am, notwithstanding the plausibility of Dr. Warburton&rsquo;s conjecture, inclined to doubt. Every man adheres as long as he can to his own pre-conceptions. Before I read this note I considered the character of Holofernes as borrowed from the Rhombus of sir Philip Sidney, who, in a kind of pastoral entertainment, exhibited to queen Elizabeth, has introduced a school-master so called, speaking <span class="t8">a leash of languages at once</span>, and puzzling himself and his auditors with a jargon like that of Holofernes in the present play. Sidney himself might bring the character from Italy; for, as Peacham observes, the school-master has long been one of the ridiculous personages in the farces of that country.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.ii.29 (395,4)</p>
<p class="p26">[And such barren plants are set before us, that we<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;thankful should be,<br/>Which we taste and feeling are for those parts that do fructify<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;in us, more than he]</p>
<p class="p24">Sir T. Hammer reads thus,</p>
<p class="p26"><span class="t8">And such barren plants are set before us, that we<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;thankful should be,<br/>For those parts which we taste and feel do fructify<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;in us more than he.</span></p>
<p class="p24">And Mr. Edwards, in his animadversions on Dr. Warburton&rsquo;s notes, applauds the emendation. I think both the editors mistaken, except that sir T. Hammer found the metre, though he missed the sense. I read, with a slight change,</p>
<p class="p26">&nbsp;<span class="t8">And such barren plants are set before us, that we<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thankful should be</span>,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;When <span class="t8">we taste and feeling are for those parts that<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;do fructify in us more than he</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">That is, <span class="t8">such barren plants</span> are exhibited in the creation, to make us <span class="t8">thankful when we have more taste and feeling than he, of those parts</span> or qualities <span class="t8">which</span> produce fruit <span class="t8">in us</span>, and preserve as from being likewise <span class="t8">barren plants</span>. Such is the sense, just in itself and pious, but a little clouded by the diction of sir Nathaniel. The length of these lines was no novelty on the English stage. The moralities afford scenes of the like measure. (1773)</p>
<p class="p24">IV.ii.32 (396,5)</p>
<p class="p26">&nbsp;[For as it would ill become me to be vain, indiscreet,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or a fool;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;So were there a patch set on learning, to see<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him in a school]</p>
<p class="p24">The meaning is, to be in a school would as ill become a <span class="t8">patch</span>, or low fellow, as folly would become me.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.ii.99 (399,2) [<span class="t8">Vinegia. Vinegia, Chi non te vedi, ei non te pregia</span>] [This reading is an emendation by Theobald] The proverb, as I am informed, is this; <span class="t8">He that sees Venice little, values it much; he that sees it much, values it little</span>. But I suppose Mr. Theobald is right, for the true proverb would hot serve the speaker&rsquo;s purpose.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.ii.156 (403,6) [colourable colours] That is specious, or fair seeming appearances.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.iii.3 (403,7) [I am toiling in a pitch] Alluding to lady Rosaline&rsquo;s complexion, who is through the whole play represented as a black beauty.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.iii.29 (404,8) [The night of dew, that on my cheeks down flows] I cannot think the <span class="t8">night of dew</span> the true reading, but know not what to offer.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.iii.47 (405,9) [he comes in like a perjure, wearing papers] The punishment of perjury is to wear on the breast a paper expressing the crime.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.iii.74 (406,2) [the liver-vein] The liver was anciently supposed to be the seat of love.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.iii.110 (408,5) [<span class="t8">Air, would I might triumph so</span>!] Perhaps we may better read,</p>
<p class="p24">Ah! <span class="t8">would I might triumph so!</span></p>
<p class="p24">IV.iii.117 (409,7) [ay true love&rsquo;s fasting pain] [W: festring] There is no need of any alteration. <span class="t8">Fasting</span> is <span class="t8">longing, hungry, wanting</span>.</p>
<p class="p26">IV.iii.148 (410,8) [How will he triumph, leap, and laugh at it?]<br/>[W: geap] To <span class="t8">leap</span> is to <span class="t8">exult</span>, to skip for joy. It must stand.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.iii.166 (410,9) [To see a king transformed to a knot!] <span class="t8">Knot</span> has no sense that can suit this place. We may read <span class="t8">sot</span>. The rhimes in this play are such, as that <span class="t8">sat</span> and <span class="t8">sot</span> may be well enough admitted.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.iii.180 (412,2) [With men like men] [W: vane-like] This is well imagined, but perhaps the poet may mean, with <span class="t8">men like</span> common <span class="t8">men</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.iii.231 (414,3) [She (an attending star)] Something like this is a stanza of sir Henry Wotton, of which the poetical reader will forgive the insertion.</p>
<p class="p26">&nbsp;&mdash; <span class="t8">Ye stars, the train of night,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That poorly satisfy our eyes<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;More by your number than your light:<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ye common people of the skies,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;What are ye when the sun shall rise</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.iii.256 (415,6) [And beauty&rsquo;s crest becomes the heavens well] [W: crete] This emendation cannot be received till its authour can prove that <span class="t8">crete</span> is an English word. Besides, <span class="t8">crest</span> is here properly opposed to <span class="t8">badge</span>. <span class="t8">Black</span>, says the King, is the <span class="t8">badge of hell</span>, but that which graces the heaven is <span class="t8">the crest of</span> beauty. <span class="t8">Black</span> darkens hell, and is therefore hateful; <span class="t8">white</span> adorns heaven, and is therefore lovely.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.iii.290 (417,8) [affection&rsquo;s men at arms] <span class="t8">A man at arms</span>, is a soldier armed at all points both offensively and defensively. It is no more than, <span class="t8">Ye soldiers of affection</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.iii.313 (418,2) [Teaches such beauty as a woman&rsquo;s eye] i.e. a lady&rsquo;s eyes gives a fuller notion of beauty than any authour.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.iii.321 (418.3) [In leaden contemplation have found out Such fiery numbers] <span class="t8">Numbers</span> are, in this passage, nothing more than <span class="t8">poetical measures</span>. <span class="t8">Could you</span>, says Biron, <span class="t8">by solitary contemplation, have attained such poetical</span> fire, <span class="t8">such spritely numbers, as have been prompted by the eyes of beauty</span>? The astronomer, by looking too much aloft, falls into a ditch.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.iii.358 (422,9)</p>
<p class="p26">&nbsp;[Or for love&rsquo;s sake, a word, that loves all men;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Or for men&rsquo;s sake, the author of these women;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Or women&rsquo;s sake, by whom we men are men]</p>
<p class="p24">Perhaps we might read thus, transposing the lines,</p>
<p class="p26">&nbsp;<span class="t8">Or for love&rsquo;s sake, a word that loves all men;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;For women&rsquo;s sake, by whom we men are men;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Or for men&rsquo;s sake, the authours of these women</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">The antithesis of <span class="t8">a word that all men love</span>, and <span class="t8">a word which loves all men</span>, though in itself worth little, has much of the spirit of this play.</p>
<p class="p26">IV.iii.386 (423,2) [If so, our copper buys no better treasure] Here<br/>Mr. Theobald ends the third act.</p>
<p class="p24">V.i.3 (423,3) [your reasons at dinner have been sharp and sententious] I know not well what degree of respect Shakespeare intends to obtain for this vicar, but he has here put into his mouth a finished representation of colloquial excellence. It is very difficult to add any thing to this character of the school-master&rsquo;s table-talk, and perhaps all the precepts of Castiglione will scarcely be found to comprehend a rule for conversation so justly delineated, so widely dilated, and so nicely limited.</p>
<p class="p24">It may be proper just to note, that <span class="t8">reason</span> here, and in many other places, signifies <span class="t8">discourse</span>; and that <span class="t8">audacious</span> is used in a good sense for <span class="t8">spirited, animated, confident</span>. <span class="t8">Opinion</span> is the same with <span class="t8">obstinacy</span> or <span class="t8">opinionated</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">V.i.14 (424,4) [He is too picked] To have the beard <span class="t8">piqued</span> or shorn so as to end in a point, was, in our authour&rsquo;s time, a mark of a traveller affecting foreign fashions: so says the Bastard in K. John, &mdash; I catechise <span class="t8">My</span> piqued <span class="t8">man of countries</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">V.i.29 (425,6) [(<span class="t8">Ne intelligis, Domine.</span>) to make frantick, lunatick?] There seems yet something wanting to the integrity of this passage, which Mr. Theobald has in the most corrupt and difficult places very happily restored. For <span class="t8">ne intelligis domine, to make frantick, lunatick</span>, I read, (nonne <span class="t8">intelligis, domine?</span>) to <span class="t8">be</span> mad, frantick, lunatick.</p>
<p class="p24">V.i.44 (427,6) [<span class="t8">honorificabilitudinitatibus</span>] This word, whencesoever it comes, is often mentioned as the longest word known. (1773)</p>
<p class="p24">V.i.110 (429,6) [dally with my excrement] The authour has before called the beard <span class="t8">valour&rsquo;s excrement</span> in the Merchant of Venice.</p>
<p class="p24">V.ii.43 (432,5) [&lsquo;Ware pencils!] The former editions read,</p>
<p class="p24">Were <span class="t8">pencils</span> &mdash;&mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">Sir T. Hammer here rightly restored,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Ware <span class="t8">pencils</span> &mdash;&mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">Rosaline, a black beauty, reproaches the fair Catherine for painting.</p>
<p class="p24">V.ii.69 (434,9) [None are so surely caught when they are catch&rsquo;d, As wit turn&rsquo;d fool] These are observation worthy of a man who has surveyed human nature with the closest attention.</p>
<p class="p24">V.ii.87 (434,1) [Saint Dennis to St. Cupid!] The Princess of France invokes, with too much levity, the patron of her country, to oppose his power to that of Cupid.</p>
<p class="p24">V.ii.117 (435,2) [spleen ridiculous] is, a ridiculous <span class="t8">fit</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">V.ii.205 (439,5) [Vouchsafe, bright moon, and these thy stars] When queen Elizabeth asked an ambassadour how he liked her ladies, <span class="t8">It is hard,</span> said he, <span class="t8">to judge of stars in the presence of the sun.</span></p>
<p class="p24">V.ii.235 (440,6) [Since you can cog] To <span class="t8">cog</span> signifies <span class="t8">to falsify the dice,</span> and <span class="t8">to falsify a narrative,</span> or <span class="t8">to lye.</span></p>
<p class="p24">V.ii.281 (442,7) [better wits have worn plain statute-caps] This line is not universally understood, because every reader does not know that a statute cap is part of the academical habit. Lady Rosaline declares that her expectation was disappointed by these courtly students, and that <span class="t8">better wits</span> might be found in the common places of education. [Gray had offered a different explanation] I think my own interpretation of this passage right. (see 1765, II,197,3)</p>
<p class="p24">V.ii.295 (443,8)</p>
<p class="p26">&nbsp;[Fair ladies, mask&rsquo;d, are roses in their bud;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Dismask&rsquo;d, their damask sweet commixture shewn,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Are angels vailing clouds, or roses blown]</p>
<p class="p24">[Hammer: angels vailing clouds] [Warburton exercised his sarcasm on this] I know not why Sir T. Hanmer&rsquo;s explanation should be treated with so much contempt, or why <span class="t8">vailing clouds</span> should be <span class="t8">capping the sun. Ladies unmask&rsquo;d,</span> says Boyet, <span class="t8">are</span> like <span class="t8">angels vailing clouds,</span> or letting those clouds which obscured their brightness, sink from before them. What is there in this absurd or contemptible?</p>
<p class="p24">V.ii.309 (444,1) [<span class="t8">Exeunt ladies</span>] Mr. Theobald ends the fourth act here.</p>
<p class="p24">V.ii.337 (447,4) [ &mdash; behaviour, what wert thou, &lsquo;Till this mad man shew&rsquo;d thee? and what art thou now?] [These are two wonderfully fine lines, intimating that what courts call <span class="t8">manners,</span> and value themselves so much upon teaching, as a thing no where else to be learnt, is a modest silent accomplishment under the direction of nature and common sense, which does its office in promoting social life without being taken notice of. But that when it degerates into shew and parade, it becomes an unmanly contemptible quality. Warburton.] What is told in this note is undoubtedly true, but is not comprised in the quotation.</p>
<p class="p24">V.ii.348 (448,5) [The virtue of your eye must break my oath] I believe the author means that the <span class="t8">virtue,</span> in which word <span class="t8">goodness</span> and <span class="t8">power</span> are both comprised, <span class="t8">must dissolve</span> the obligation of the oath. The Princess, in her answer, takes the most invidious part of the ambiguity.</p>
<p class="p24">V.ii.374 (449,6)</p>
<p class="p26">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[when we greet<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;With eyes best seeing, heaven&rsquo;s fiery eye,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;By light we lose light: your capacity<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Is of that nature, as to your huge store<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Wise things seem foolish, and rich things but poor]</p>
<p class="p24">This is a very lofty and elegant compliment.</p>
<p class="p24">V.ii.419 (450,7) [Write, <span class="t8">Lord have mercy on us</span>, on those three] This was the inscription put upon the door of the houses infected with the plague, to which Biron compares the love of himself and his companions; and pursuing the metaphor finds the <span class="t8">tokens</span> likewise on the ladies. The <span class="t8">tokens</span> of the plague are the first spots or discolorations, by which the infection is known to be received.</p>
<p class="p24">V.ii.426 (451,8) [how can this be true, That you stand forfeit, being those that sue?] That is, how can those be liable to forfeiture that begin the process. The jest lies in the ambiguity of <span class="t8">sue</span>, which signifies <span class="t8">to prosecute by law</span>, or to <span class="t8">offer a petition</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">V.ii.440 (451,9) [you force not to forswear] <span class="t8">You force not</span> is the same with <span class="t8">you make no difficulty</span>. This is a very just observation. The crime which has been once committed, is committed again with less reluctance.</p>
<p class="p24">V.ii.471 (452,2) [in will and error. Much upon this it is: &mdash; And might not you] I, believe this passage should be read thus,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&mdash; <span class="t8">in will and error</span>. Boyet. <span class="t8">Much upon this it is</span>. Biron. <span class="t8">And might not you</span>, &amp;c.</p>
<p class="p24">V.ii.490 (453,5) [You cannot beg us] That is, we are not fools, our next relations cannot <span class="t8">beg</span> the wardship of our persons and fortunes. One of the legal tests of a <span class="t8">natural</span> is to try whether he can number.</p>
<p class="p24">V.ii.517 (454,6)</p>
<p class="p26">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[That sport best pleases, that doth least know how.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where zeal strives to content, and the contents<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dies in the zeal of that which it presents]</p>
<p class="p24">The third line may be read better thus,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&mdash; <span class="t8">the contents</span> <span class="t8">Die in the zeal of</span> him <span class="t8">which</span> them <span class="t8">presents</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">This sentiment of the Princess is very natural, but less generous than that of the Amazonian Queen, who says, on a like occasion, in Midsummer-Night&rsquo;s Dream,</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">I love not to see wretchedness o&rsquo;ercharg&rsquo;d</span>, <span class="t8">Nor duty in his service perishing</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">V.ii.547 (455,8) [A bare throw at novum] This passage I do not understand. I fancy that <span class="t8">novum</span> should be <span class="t8">novem</span>, and that some allusion is intended between the play of <span class="t8">nine pins</span> and the play of the <span class="t8">nine</span> worthies, but it lies too deep for my investigation.</p>
<p class="p24">V.ii.581 (457,2) [A-jax] There is a conceit of <span class="t8">Ajax</span> and <span class="t8">a jakes</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">V.ii.694 (461,4) [more Ates] That is, more instigation. Ate was the mischievous goddess that incited bloodshed.</p>
<p class="p24">V.ii.702 (461,5) [my arms] The weapons and armour which he wore in the character of Pompey.</p>
<p class="p24">V.ii.744 (463,8) [In the converse of breath] Perhaps <span class="t8">converse</span> may, in this line, mean <span class="t8">interchange</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">V.ii.755 (464,2) [which fain it would convince] We must read,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&mdash; <span class="t8">which fain</span> would it <span class="t8">convince</span>;</p>
<p class="p24">that is, the entreaties of love which would fain <span class="t8">over-power</span> grief. So Lady Macbeth declares, <span class="t8">That she will</span> convince <span class="t8">the chamberlain with wine</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">V.ii.762 (464,3) [Honest plain words best pierce the ear of grief] As it seems not very proper for Biron to court the princess for the king in the king&rsquo;s presence, at this critical moment, I believe the speech is given to a wrong person. I read thus,</p>
<p class="p26">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prin. <span class="t8">I understand you not, my griefs are double:<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Honest plain words best pierce the ear of grief.</span><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King. <span class="t8">And by these badges</span>, &amp;c.</p>
<p class="p24">V.ii.779 (465,4) [Suggested us] That is, <span class="t8">tempted</span> us.</p>
<p class="p24">V.ii.790 (465,5) [As bombast, and as lining to the time] This line is obscure. <span class="t8">Bombast</span> was a kind of loose texture not unlike what is now called wadding, used to give the dresses of that time bulk and protruberance, without much increase of weight; whence the same name is given a tumour of words unsupported by solid sentiment. The Princess, therefore, says, that they considered this courtship as but <span class="t8">bombast</span>, as something to fill out life, which not being closely united with it, might be thrown away at pleasure.</p>
<p class="p24">V.ii.795 (466,7) [We did not quote them so] [We should read, <span class="t8">quote</span>, esteem, reckon. Warburton] though our old writers spelling by the ear, probably wrote <span class="t8">cote</span>, as it was pronounced. (see 1765, II,218,5)</p>
<p class="p24">V.ii.823 (467,8) [To flatter up these powers of mine with rest] Dr. Warburton would read <span class="t8">fetter</span>, but <span class="t8">flatter</span> or <span class="t8">sooth</span> is, in my opinion, more apposite to the king&rsquo;s purpose than <span class="t8">fetter</span>. Perhaps we may read,</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">To flatter</span> on <span class="t8">these</span> hours of time <span class="t8">with rest</span>;</p>
<p class="p24">That is, I would not deny to live in the hermitage, to make the year of delay pass in quiet.</p>
<p class="p24">V.ii.873 (469,2) [dear groans] <span class="t8">Dear</span> should here, as in many other places, be <span class="t8">dere</span>, sad, odious.</p>
<p class="p24">V.ii.904 (470,3) [<span class="t8">When daisies pied, and violets blue</span>] The first lines of this song that were transposed, have been replaced by Mr. Theobald.</p>
<p class="p24">V.ii.907 (470,5) [<span class="t8">Do paint the meadows with delight</span>] [W: much bedight] Much less elegant than the present reading.</p>
<p class="p24">(472,7) General Observation. In this play, which all the editors have concurred to censure, and some have rejected as unworthy of him.</p>
