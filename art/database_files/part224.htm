A second rule may have a condition that salary is between $30,000 and $50,000, and education level is high-school, with the credit rating class of <i>satisfactory</i>, and a conﬁdence of 80%. A third rule may have a condition that salary is above $50,001, with the credit rating class of <i>excellent</i>, and conﬁdence of 90%.
