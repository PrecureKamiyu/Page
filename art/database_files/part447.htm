We saw in Chapter 6 to Chap- ter 9 how to design and build an application. One of the aspects of application design is the performance one expects out of the application. In fact, it is common to ﬁnd that once an application has been built, it runs slower than the designers wanted or handles fewer transactions per second than they required. An application that takes an excessive amount of time to perform requested actions can cause user dissatisfaction at best and be completely unusable at worst.</p><p style="padding-left: 119pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">Applications can be made to run signiﬁcantly faster by performance tuning, which consists of ﬁnding and eliminating bottlenecks and adding appropriate hardware such as memory or disks. There are many things an application developer can do to tune the application, and there are things that a database-system administrator can do to speed up processing for an application.</p><p style="padding-left: 119pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">Benchmarks are standardized sets of tasks that help to characterize the perfor- mance of database systems. They are useful to get a rough idea of the hardware and software requirements of an application, even before the application is built.</p><p style="padding-left: 119pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">Applications must be tested as they are being developed. Testing requires gener- ation of database states and test inputs, and verifying that the outputs match the ex- pected outputs. We discuss issues in application testing. Legacy systems are application systems that are outdated and usually based on older-generation technology. However, they are often at the core of organizations and run mission-critical applications. We outline issues in interfacing with and issues in migrating away from legacy systems, replacing them with more modern systems.</p><p style="padding-left: 119pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">Standards are very important for application development, especially in the age of the internet, since applications need to communicate with each other to perform use- ful tasks. A variety of standards have been proposed that aﬀect database-application development, which we outline in this chapter. Organizations often store information about users in directory systems. Applications often use such directory systems to au- thenticate users and to get basic information about users, such as user categories (e.g.,</p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 119pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;">1209</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 88pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark552">student, instructor, and so on).
