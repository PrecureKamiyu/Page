  <h1>Colophon</h1>

  <p>The animal on the cover of <em>Programming Rust</em> is a Montagu’s crab (<em>Xantho hydrophilus</em>).</p>
  
  <p>This robust-looking crab has a muscly appearance with a broad carapace about 70 mm wide. The edge of the carapace is furrowed and the color is yellowish or reddish-brown. It has 10 legs (five pairs): the front pair of legs (the chelipeds) are equal in size with black-tipped claws or pincers; then there are three pairs of walking legs that are stout and relatively short; and the last pair of legs are for swimming. They walk and swim sideways.</p> 

<p>Montagu’s crab has been found in the northeastern Atlantic ocean and in the Mediterranean Sea. It lives under rocks and boulders during low tide. If one is exposed when a rock has been lifted, it will aggressively hold its pincers up and spread them wide open to make itself appear bigger.</p>

<p>This crab eats algae, snails, and crabs of other species. It is mostly active at night. Egg-bearing females are found from March through July and the larvae are present on plankton for most of the summer.
