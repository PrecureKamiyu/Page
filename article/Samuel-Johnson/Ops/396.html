<p class="p21">Although having tended to be an opponent of the government early in life, Johnson published a series of pamphlets throughout the 1770s in favour of various government policies. In 1770 he produced <span class="t8">The False Alarm</span>, a political pamphlet attacking the radical politician John Wilkes. In 1771, his <span class="t8">Thoughts on the Late Transactions Respecting Falkland&rsquo;s Islands</span> cautioned against war with Spain, while in 1774 the author printed <span class="t8">The Patriot</span>, a critique of what he viewed as false patriotism. </p>
