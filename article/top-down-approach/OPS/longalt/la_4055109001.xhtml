The y-axis starts at 1 and moves upwards in increments of one to 12. Along the x-axis we see a cluster of plotted points: very close to the intersection of x and y we see three points plotted close together-the first is labeled "t0," the second is labeled "t0+Delta," and the third is labeled "t0 + 2Delta." Further along the x-axis are three more plotted points-the first is labeled "t1," the second is labeled "t1 + Delta," and the third is labeled t2." Just beyond the halfway point on the x-axis are two more plotted points-the first is labeled "t3" and the second is labeled "t3 + Delta."</p><p id="P700101195200000000000000000BB39" data-uri="M09_KURO4140_07_SE_C09.xhtml#P700101195200000000000000000BB39">At point t0, a blue line extends upwards in a stair-step fashion, up to 1 and over, then up to 2 and over, etc. up to 11 on the y-axis. The area between 2 and 3 is identified as "Variable network delay," for this plotted point and the others to come. The area between 8 and 9 is labeled "Constant bit rate video transmission by server."</p><p id="P700101195200000000000000000BB3A" data-uri="M09_KURO4140_07_SE_C09.xhtml#P700101195200000000000000000BB3A">At point t1, a dark blue line extends upwards in a less consistent stair-step fashion, rising to 1 then over an inch, then up to 2 and over incrementally, then up and over incrementally three times to 5, then over an inch and up to 6, over an inch and up to 7, over incrementally and up to 8, over by more than an inch and up, and over and up in increments to 11. The area between 7 and 8 is identified as "Video reception at client."</p><p id="P700101195200000000000000000BB3B" data-uri="M09_KURO4140_07_SE_C09.xhtml#P700101195200000000000000000BB3B">At point t3, a light blue line extends upwards in a consistent stair-step fashion similar to t0. The area between 7 and 8 is labeled "Constant bit rate video playout by client."</p></div></section></body></html>
