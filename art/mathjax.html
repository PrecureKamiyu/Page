<h1>MathJax</h1>
<h2>What happens in Markdown</h2>
<p>
    There is no such thing as "LaTeX in markdown". Most of the markdown previewers use MathJax or katex. They are based on MathML and are totally different frome LaTeX.
</p>

<h2>Employ MathJax in your website</h2>
<p>Just read the document of MathJax. Note that MathJax version 2 support different fonts while version 3 does
    not. If you are willing to change the font, you should check the documentation of MathJax version 2.</p>

<h2>Change the font in your website</h2>
<p>Note that there is actually three ways to render your formula:</p>
<ol>
    <li>CHTML</li>
    <li>HTML+CSS</li>
    <li>SVG</li>
</ol>
<p>where CHTML only supports one font. You may change the configuration to HTML+CSS or SVG if you want to change
    the font.
    The configuration is determined based on your source. Anyway, you may read the source code on current
    website for a check. After you change the configuration, read the documentation of MathJax font to change
    the configuration of SVG or HTML+CSS to display your preferred font.</p>
<p>Two Steps: 1. Change the rendering methods to SVG or the other; 2. Configure the font that SVG use.</p>
<p>There are five kinds of fonts available. </p>
<ol>
    <li>TeX. Looks like CMU Serif but a little boldface-ish.</li>
    <li>STIX, which is ugly under most of the circumstances.</li>
    <li>Asana-Math, which is ugly under most of the circumstances, just like STIX.</li>
    <li>Neo-Euler, which is pretty cool because you rarely see it, and Knuth use this font in his book
        <i>Concrete Mathematics</i></li>
    <li>Latin-Modern, which is preferred since it suits CMU serif font best, but looks not so good because of
        SVG rendering.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here is some test in-line formula: \( a = b \), \(\sum_{n=1} ^{\infty} a_n\). The following is displayed
    formula:</p>
\[ G/\ker f \cong \text{Im}\, f\]
<p>where \(f \) is a homomorphism from \(G \) to \(G'\).</p>
<p>Hey, do you know that we can actually write <code>\ker</code> to display \(\ker\)</p>

<h2>The spacing between lines</h2>
<p>It is possible for a in-line math formula to change the line-height, even for simple formulas like \(g^2\) sometimes.</p>
