We have learned a few important lessons along the way: to be careful with acquisition and release of locks around control flow changes; that enabling more concurrency does not necessarily increase performance; that performance problems should only be remedied once they exist. This last point, of avoiding <b>premature optimization</b>, is cen- tral to any performance-minded developer; there is no value in making something faster if doing so will not improve the overall performance of the application.</p><p style="padding-left: 68pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Of course, we have just scratched the surface of high performance structures. See Moir and Shavit’s excellent survey for more information, as well as links to other sources [MS04]. In particular, you might be inter- ested in other structures (such as B-trees); for this knowledge, a database class is your best bet. You also might be interested in techniques that don’t use traditional locks at all; such <b>non-blocking data structures </b>are some- thing we’ll get a taste of in the chapter on common concurrency bugs, but frankly this topic is an entire area of knowledge requiring more study than is possible in this humble book. Find out more on your own if you are interested (as always!).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part305.htm">&lt; 上一个</a><span> | </span><a href="../ostep.html">内容</a><span> | </span><a href="part307.htm">下一个 &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
