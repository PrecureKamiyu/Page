<p class="p24">On Friday, June 11, we talked at breakfast, of forms of prayer. JOHNSON. &lsquo;I know of no good prayers but those in the Book of Common Prayer<span class="t8">.&rsquo; DR. ADAMS, (in a very earnest manner): &lsquo;I wish, Sir, you would compose some family prayers.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;I will not compose prayers for you, Sir, because you can do it for yourself. But I have thought of getting together all the books of prayers which I could, selecting those which should appear to me the best, putting out some, inserting others, adding some prayers of my own, and prefixing a discourse on prayer.&rsquo; We all now gathered about him, and two or three of us at a time joined in pressing him to execute this plan. He seemed to be a little displeased at the manner of our importunity, and in great agitation called out, &lsquo;Do not talk thus of what is so aweful. I know not what time GOD will allow me in this world. There are many things which I wish to do.&rsquo; Some of us persisted, and Dr. Adams said, &lsquo;I never was more serious about any thing in my life.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Let me alone, let me alone; I am overpowered.&rsquo; And then he put his hands before his face, and reclined for some time upon the table.</span></p>
<p class="p24">I mentioned Jeremy Taylor&rsquo;s using, in his forms of prayer, &lsquo;I am the chief of sinners,&rsquo; and other such self-condemning expressions. &lsquo;Now, (said I) this cannot be said with truth by every man, and therefore is improper for a general printed form. I myself cannot say that I am the worst of men; I will <span class="t8">not say so.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;A man may know, that physically, that is, in the real state of things, he is not the worst man; but that morally he may be so. Law observes that &ldquo;Every man knows something worse of himself, than he is sure of in others.&rdquo; You may not have committed such crimes as some men have done; but you do not know against what degree of light they have sinned. Besides, Sir, &ldquo;the chief of sinners&rdquo; is a mode of expression for &ldquo;I am a great sinner.&rdquo; So St. Paul, speaking of our SAVIOUR&rsquo;S having died to save sinners, says, &ldquo;of whom I am the chief;&rdquo; yet he certainly did not think himself so bad as Judas Iscariot.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;But, Sir, Taylor means it literally, for he founds a conceit upon it. When praying for the conversion of sinners, and of himself in particular, he says, &ldquo;LORD, thou wilt not leave thy</span> chief <span class="t8">work undone.&rdquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;I do not approve of figurative expressions in addressing the Supreme Being; and I never use them. Taylor gives a very good advice: &ldquo;Never lie in your prayers; never confess more than you really believe; never promise more than you mean to perform.&rdquo; I recollected this precept in his</span> Golden Grove<span class="t8">; but his</span> example <span class="t8">for prayer contradicts his</span> precept<span class="t8">.&rsquo;</span></p>
<p class="p24">Dr. Johnson and I went in Dr. Adams&rsquo;s coach to dine with Dr. Nowell, Principal of St. Mary Hall, at his beautiful villa at Iffley, on the banks of the Isis, about two miles from Oxford. While we were upon the road, I had the resolution to ask Johnson whether he thought that the roughness of his manner had been an advantage or not, and if he would not have done more good if he had been more gentle. I proceeded to answer myself thus: &lsquo;Perhaps it has been of advantage, as it has given weight to what you said: you could not, perhaps, have talked with such authority without it.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;No, Sir; I have done more good as I am. Obscenity and Impiety have always been repressed in my company.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;True, Sir; and that is more than can be said of every Bishop. Greater liberties have been taken in the presence of a Bishop, though a very good man, from his being milder, and therefore not commanding such awe. Yet, Sir, many people who might have been benefited by your conversation, have been frightened away. A worthy friend of ours has told me, that he has often been afraid to talk to you.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, he need not have been afraid, if he had any thing rational to say. If he had not, it was better he did not talk.</p>
<p class="p24">Dr. Nowell is celebrated for having preached a sermon before the House of Commons, on the 3Oth of January, 1773, full of high Tory sentiments, for which he was thanked as usual, and printed it at their request; but, in the midst of that turbulence and faction which disgraced a part of the present reign, the thanks were afterwards ordered to be expunged. This strange conduct sufficiently exposes itself; and Dr. Nowell will ever have the honour which is due to a lofty friend of our monarchical constitution. Dr. Johnson said to me, &lsquo;Sir, the Court will be very much to blame, if he is not promoted.&rsquo; I told this to Dr. Nowell, and asserting my humbler, though not less zealous exertions in the same cause, I suggested that whatever return we might receive, we should still have the consolation of being like Butler&rsquo;s steady and generous Royalist,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;True as the dial to the sun,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it be not shone upon912.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">We were well entertained and very happy at Dr. Nowell&rsquo;s, where was a very agreeable company, and we drank &lsquo;Church and King&rsquo; after dinner, with true Tory cordiality.</p>
<p class="p24">We talked of a certain clergyman of extraordinary character, who by exerting his talents in writing on temporary topicks, and displaying uncommon intrepidity, had raised himself to affluence. I maintained that we ought not to be indignant at his success; for merit of every sort was entitled to reward. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, I will not allow this man to have merit. No, Sir; what he has is rather the contrary; I will, indeed, allow him courage, and on this account we so far give him credit. We have more respect for a man who robs boldly on the highway, than for a fellow who jumps out of a ditch, and knocks you down behind your back. Courage is a quality so necessary for maintaining virtue, that it is always respected, even when it is associated with vice.</p>
<p class="p24">I censured the coarse invectives which were become fashionable in the House of Commons, and said that if members of parliament must attack each other personally in the heat of debate, it should be done more genteely. JOHNSON. &lsquo;No, Sir; that would be much worse. Abuse is not so dangerous when there is no vehicle of wit or delicacy, no subtle conveyance. The difference between coarse and refined abuse is as the difference between being bruised by a club, and wounded by a poisoned arrow.&rsquo; I have since observed his position elegantly expressed by Dr. Young: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;As the soft plume gives swiftness to the dart,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good breeding sends the satire to the heart916.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Saturday, June 12, there drank tea with us at Dr. Adams&rsquo;s, Mr. John Henderson, student of Pembroke-College, celebrated for his wonderful acquirements in Alchymy, Judicial Astrology, and other abstruse and curious learning; and the Reverend Herbert Croft, who, I am afraid, was somewhat mortified by Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s not being highly pleased with some Family Discourses<span class="t8">, which he had printed; they were in too familiar a style to be approved of by so manly a mind. I have no note of this evening&rsquo;s conversation, except a single fragment. When I mentioned Thomas Lord Lyttelton&rsquo;s vision, the prediction of the time of his death, and its exact fulfilment; &mdash; JOHNSON. &lsquo;It is the most extraordinary thing that has happened in my day. I heard it with my own ears, from his uncle, Lord Westcote. I am so glad to have every evidence of the spiritual world, that I am willing to believe it.&rsquo; DR. ADAMS. &lsquo;You have evidence enough; good evidence, which needs not such support.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;I like to have more.&rsquo;</span></p>
<p class="p24">Mr. Henderson, with whom I had sauntered in the venerable walks of Merton-College, and found him a very learned and pious man, supped with us. Dr. Johnson surprised him not a little, by acknowledging with a look of horrour, that he was much oppressed by the fear of death. The amiable Dr. Adams suggested that GOD was infinitely good. JOHNSON. &lsquo;That he is infinitely good, as far as the perfection of his nature will allow, I certainly believe; but it is necessary for good upon the whole, that individuals should be punished. As to an individual<span class="t8">, therefore, he is not infinitely good; and as I cannot be</span> sure <span class="t8">that I have fulfilled the conditions on which salvation is granted, I am afraid I may be one of those who shall be damned.&rsquo; (looking dismally.) DR. ADAMS. &lsquo;What do you mean by damned?&rsquo; JOHNSON. (passionately and loudly) &lsquo;Sent to Hell, Sir, and punished everlastingly.&rsquo; DR. ADAMS. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t believe that doctrine.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Hold, Sir, do you believe that some will be punished at all?&rsquo; DR. ADAMS. &lsquo;Being excluded from Heaven will be a punishment; yet there may be no great positive suffering.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Well, Sir; but, if you admit any degree of punishment, there is an end of your argument for infinite goodness simply considered; for, infinite goodness would inflict no punishment whatever. There is not infinite goodness physically considered; morally there is.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;But may not a man attain to such a degree of hope as not to be uneasy from the fear of death?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;A man may have such a degree of hope as to keep him quiet. You see I am not quiet, from the vehemence with which I talk; but I do not despair.&rsquo; MRS. ADAMS. &lsquo;You seem, Sir, to forget the merits of our Redeemer.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Madam, I do not forget the merits of my Redeemer; but my Redeemer has said that he will set some on his right hand and some on his left.&rsquo; He was in gloomy agitation, and said, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll have no more on&rsquo;t.&rsquo; If what has now been stated should be urged by the enemies of Christianity, as if its influence on the mind were not benignant, let it be remembered, that Johnson&rsquo;s temperament was melancholy, of which such direful apprehensions of futurity are often a common effect. We shall presently see that when he approached nearer to his aweful change, his mind became tranquil, and he exhibited as much fortitude as becomes a thinking man in that situation.</span></p>
<p class="p24">From the subject of death we passed to discourse of life, whether it was upon the whole more happy or miserable. Johnson was decidedly for the balance of misery: in confirmation of which I maintained, that no man would choose to lead over again the life which he had experienced. Johnson acceded to that opinion in the strongest terms. This is an inquiry often made; and its being a subject of disquisition is a proof that much misery presses upon human feelings; for those who are conscious of a felicity of existence, would never hesitate to accept of a repetition of it. I have met with very few who would. I have heard Mr. Burke make use of a very ingenious and plausible argument on this subject;&mdash; &lsquo;Every man (said he) would lead his life over again; for, every man is willing to go on and take an addition to his life, which, as he grows older, he has no reason to think will be better, or even so good as what has preceded.&rsquo; I imagine, however, the truth is, that there is a deceitful hope that the next part of life will be free from the pains, and anxieties, and sorrows, which we have already felt. We are for wise purposes &lsquo;Condemn&rsquo;d to Hope&rsquo;s delusive mine;&rsquo; as Johnson finely says; and I may also quote the celebrated lines of Dryden, equally philosophical and poetical: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;When I consider life, &rsquo;tis all a cheat,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet fool&rsquo;d with hope, men favour the deceit:</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trust on, and think to-morrow will repay;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To-morrow&rsquo;s falser than the former day;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lies worse; and while it says we shall be blest</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With some new joys, cuts off what we possest.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strange cozenage! none would live past years again;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet all hope pleasure in what yet remain;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And from the dregs of life think to receive,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What the first sprightly running could not give927.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">It was observed to Dr. Johnson, that it seemed strange that he, who has so often delighted his company by his lively and brilliant conversation, should say he was miserable. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Alas! it is all outside; I may be cracking my joke, and cursing the sun. Sun, how I hate thy beams<span class="t8">!&rsquo; I knew not well what to think of this declaration; whether to hold it as a genuine picture of his mind, or as the effect of his persuading himself contrary to fact, that the position which he had assumed as to human unhappiness, was true. We may apply to him a sentence in Mr. Greville&rsquo;s</span> Maxims, Characters, and Reflections<span class="t8">; a book which is entitled to much more praise than it has received: &lsquo;ARISTARCHUS is charming: how full of knowledge, of sense, of sentiment. You get him with difficulty to your supper; and after having delighted every body and himself for a few hours, he is obliged to return home; &mdash; he is finishing his treatise, to prove that unhappiness is the portion of man.&rsquo;</span></p>
<p class="p24">On Sunday, June 13, our philosopher was calm at breakfast. There was something exceedingly pleasing in our leading a College life, without restraint, and with superiour elegance, in consequence of our living in the Master&rsquo;s house, and having the company of ladies. Mrs. Kennicot related, in his presence, a lively saying of Dr. Johnson to Miss Hannah More, who had expressed a wonder that the poet who had written Paradise Lost <span class="t8">should write such poor Sonnets:&mdash; &lsquo; Milton, Madam, was a genius that could cut a Colossus from a rock; but could not carve heads upon cherry-stones.&rsquo;</span></p>
<p class="p24">We talked of the casuistical question, Whether it was allowable at any time to depart from Truth<span class="t8">? JOHNSON. &lsquo;The general rule is, that Truth should never be violated, because it is of the utmost importance to the comfort of life, that we should have a full security by mutual faith; and occasional inconveniences should be willingly suffered that we may preserve it. There must, however, be some exceptions. If, for instance, a murderer should ask you which way a man is gone, you may tell him what is not true, because you are under a previous obligation not to betray a man to a murderer.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Supposing the person who wrote</span> Junius <span class="t8">were asked whether he was the authour, might he deny it?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know what to say to this. If you were</span> sure <span class="t8">that he wrote</span> Junius<span class="t8">, would you, if he denied it, think as well of him afterwards? Yet it may be urged, that what a man has no right to ask, you may refuse to communicate; and there is no other effectual mode of preserving a secret and an important secret, the discovery of which may be very hurtful to you, but a flat denial; for if you are silent, or hesitate, or evade, it will be held equivalent to a confession. But stay, Sir; here is another case. Supposing the authour had told me confidentially that he had written</span> Junius<span class="t8">, and I were asked if he had, I should hold myself at liberty to deny it, as being under a previous promise, express or implied, to conceal it. Now what I ought to do for the authour, may I not do for myself? But I deny the lawfulness of telling a lie to a sick man for fear of alarming him. You have no business with consequences; you are to tell the truth. Besides, you are not sure what effect your telling him that he is in danger may have. It may bring his distemper to a crisis, and that may cure him. Of all lying, I have the greatest abhorrence of this, because I believe it has been frequently practised on myself.&rsquo;</span></p>
<p class="p24">I cannot help thinking that there is much weight in the opinion of those who have held, that Truth, as an eternal and immutable principle, ought, upon no account whatever, to be violated, from supposed previous or superiour obligations, of which every man being to judge for himself, there is great danger that we too often, from partial motives, persuade ourselves that they exist; and probably whatever extraordinary instances may sometimes occur, where some evil may be prevented by violating this noble principle, it would be found that human happiness would, upon the whole, be more perfect were Truth universally preserved.</p>
<p class="p24">In the notes to the Dunciad<span class="t8">, we find the following verses, addressed to Pope: &mdash; </span></p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;While malice, Pope, denies thy page</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its own celestial fire;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While criticks, and while bards in rage</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Admiring, won&rsquo;t admire:</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While wayward pens thy worth assail,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And envious tongues decry;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These times, though many a friend bewail,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These times bewail not I.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when the world&rsquo;s loud praise is thine,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And spleen no more shall blame;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When with thy Homer thou shalt shine</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In one establish&rsquo;d fame!</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When none shall rail, and every lay</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Devote a wreath to thee:</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That day (for come it will) that day</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall I lament to see.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">It is surely not a little remarkable, that they should appear without a name. Miss Seward, knowing Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s almost universal and minute literary information, signified a desire that I should ask him who was the authour. He was prompt with his answer: &lsquo;Why, Sir, they were written by one Lewis, who was either under-master or an usher of Westminster-school, and published a Miscellany, in which Grongar Hill<span class="t8"> first came out.&rsquo; Johnson praised them highly, and repeated them with a noble animation. In the twelfth line, instead of &lsquo;one establish&rsquo;d fame,&rsquo; he repeated &lsquo;one unclouded flame,&rsquo; which he thought was the reading in former editions: but I believe was a flash of his own genius. It is much more poetical than the other.</span></p>
<p class="p24">On Monday, June 14, and Tuesday, 15, Dr. Johnson and I dined, on one of them, I forget which, with Mr. Mickle, translator of the Lusiad<span class="t8">, at Wheatley, a very pretty country place a few miles from Oxford; and on the other with Dr. Wetherell, Master of University-College. From Dr. Wetherell&rsquo;s he went to visit Mr. Sackville Parker, the bookseller; and when he returned to us, gave the following account of his visit, saying, &lsquo;I have been to see my old friend, Sack. Parker; I find he has married his maid; he has done right. She had lived with him many years in great confidence, and they had mingled minds; I do not think he could have found any wife that would have made him so happy. The woman was very attentive and civil to me; she pressed me to fix a day for dining with them, and to say what I liked, and she would be sure to get it for me. Poor Sack! He is very ill, indeed. We parted as never to meet again. It has quite broke me down.&rsquo; This pathetic narrative was strangely diversified with the grave and earnest defence of a man&rsquo;s having married his maid. I could not but feel it as in some degree ludicrous.</span></p>
<p class="p24">In the morning of Tuesday, June 15, while we sat at Dr. Adams&rsquo;s, we talked of a printed letter from the Reverend Herbert Croft, to a young gentleman who had been his pupil, in which he advised him to read to the end of whatever books he should begin to read. JOHNSON. &lsquo;This is surely a strange advice; you may as well resolve that whatever men you happen to get acquainted with, you are to keep to them for life. A book may be good for nothing; or there may be only one thing in it worth knowing; are we to read it all through? These Voyages, (pointing to the three large volumes of Voyages to the South Sea<span class="t8">, which were just come out)</span> who <span class="t8">will read them through? A man had better work his way before the mast, than read them through; they will be eaten by rats and mice, before they are read through. There can be little entertainment in such books; one set of Savages is like another.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;I do not think the people of Otaheité can be reckoned Savages.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t cant in defence of Savages.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;They have the art of navigation.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;A dog or a cat can swim.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;They carve very ingeniously.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;A cat can scratch, and a child with a nail can scratch.&rsquo; I perceived this was none of the</span> mollia tempora fandi<span class="t8">; so desisted.</span></p>
<p class="p24">Upon his mentioning that when he came to College he wrote his first exercise twice over; but never did so afterwards; MISS ADAMS. &lsquo;I suppose, Sir, you could not make them better?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Yes, Madam, to be sure, I could make them better. Thought is better than no thought.&rsquo; MISS ADAMS. &lsquo;Do you think, Sir, you could make your Ramblers <span class="t8">better?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Certainly I could.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll lay a bet, Sir, you cannot.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;But I will, Sir, if I choose. I shall make the best of them you shall pick out, better.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;But you may add to them. I will not allow of that.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Nay, Sir, there are three ways of making them better; &mdash; putting out, &mdash; adding, &mdash; or correcting.&rsquo;</span></p>
<p class="p24">During our visit at Oxford, the following conversation passed between him and me on the subject of my trying my fortune at the English bar: Having asked whether a very extensive acquaintance in London, which was very valuable, and of great advantage to a man at large, might not be prejudicial to a lawyer, by preventing him from giving sufficient attention to his business; &mdash; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, you will attend to business, as business lays hold of you. When not actually employed, you may see your friends as much as you do now. You may dine at a Club every day, and sup with one of the members every night; and you may be as much at publick places as one who has seen them all would wish to be. But you must take care to attend constantly in Westminster-Hall; both to mind your business, as it is almost all learnt there, (for nobody reads now;) and to shew that you want to have business. And you must not be too often seen at publick places, that competitors may not have it to say, &lsquo;He is always at the Playhouse or at Ranelagh, and never to be found at his chambers.&rsquo; And, Sir, there must be a kind of solemnity in the manner of a professional man. I have nothing particular to say to you on the subject. All this I should say to any one; I should have said it to Lord Thurlow twenty years ago.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">The PROFESSION may probably think this representation of what is required in a Barrister who would hope for success, to be by much too indulgent; but certain it is, that as</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;The wits of Charles found easier ways to fame951,&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">some of the lawyers of this age who have risen high, have by no means thought it absolutely necessary to submit to that long and painful course of study which a Plowden, a Coke, and a Hale considered as requisite. My respected friend, Mr. Langton, has shewn me in the hand-writing of his grandfather, a curious account of a conversation which he had with Lord Chief Justice Hale, in which that great man tells him, &lsquo;That for two years after he came to the inn of court, he studied sixteen hours a day; however (his Lordship added) that by this intense application he almost brought himself to his grave, though he were of a very strong constitution, and after reduced himself to eight hours; but that he would not advise any body to so much; that he thought six hours a day, with attention and constancy, was sufficient; that a man must use his body as he would his horse, and his stomach; not tire him at once, but rise with an appetite.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Wednesday, June 19, Dr. Johnson and I returned to London; he was not well to-day, and said very little, employing himself chiefly in reading Euripides. He expressed some displeasure at me, for not observing sufficiently the various objects upon the road. &lsquo;If I had your eyes, Sir, (said he) I should count the passengers.&rsquo; It was wonderful how accurate his observation of visual objects was, notwithstanding his imperfect eyesight, owing to a habit of attention. That he was much satisfied with the respect paid to him at Dr. Adams&rsquo;s is thus attested by himself: &lsquo;I returned last night from Oxford, after a fortnight&rsquo;s abode with Dr. Adams, who treated me as well as I could expect or wish; and he that contents a sick man, a man whom it is impossible to please, has surely done his part well.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">After his return to London from this excursion, I saw him frequently, but have few memorandums: I shall therefore here insert some particulars which I collected at various times.</p>
<p class="p24">The Reverend Mr. Astle, of Ashbourne, in Derbyshire, brother to the learned and ingenious Thomas Astle, Esq., was from his early years known to Dr. Johnson, who obligingly advised him as to his studies, and recommended to him the following books, of which a list which he has been pleased to communicate, lies before me in Johnson&rsquo;s own hand-writing: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">Universal History (ancient.) &mdash; Rollin&rsquo;s Ancient History. &mdash; Puffendorf&rsquo;s Introduction to History. &mdash; Vertot&rsquo;s History of Knights of Malta. &mdash; Vertot&rsquo;s Revolution of Portugal. &mdash; Vertot&rsquo;s Revolutions of Sweden. &mdash; Carte&rsquo;s History of England. &mdash; Present State of England. &mdash; Geographical Grammar. &mdash; Prideaux&rsquo;s Connection. &mdash; Nelson&rsquo;s Feasts and Fasts. &mdash; Duty of Man. &mdash; Gentleman&rsquo;s Religion. &mdash; Clarendon&rsquo;s History. &mdash; Watts&rsquo;s Improvement of the Mind. &mdash; Watts&rsquo;s Logick. &mdash; Nature Displayed. &mdash; Lowth&rsquo;s English Grammar. &mdash; Blackwall on the Classicks. &mdash; Sherlock&rsquo;s Sermons. &mdash; Burnet&rsquo;s Life of Hale. &mdash; Dupin&rsquo;s History of the Church. &mdash; Shuckford&rsquo;s Connection. &mdash; Law&rsquo;s Serious Call. &mdash; Walton&rsquo;s Complete Angler. &mdash; Sandys&rsquo;s Travels. &mdash; Sprat&rsquo;s History of the Royal Society. &mdash; England&rsquo;s Gazetteer. &mdash; Goldsmith&rsquo;s Roman History. &mdash; Some Commentaries on the. Bible<span class="t8">.</span></p>
<p class="p24">It having been mentioned to Dr. Johnson that a gentleman who had a son whom he imagined to have an extreme degree of timidity, resolved to send him to a publick school, that he might acquire confidence;&mdash; &lsquo; Sir, (said Johnson,) this is a preposterous expedient for removing his infirmity; such a disposition should be cultivated in the shade. Placing him at a publick school is forcing an owl upon day.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Speaking of a gentleman whose house was much frequented by low company; &lsquo;Rags, Sir, (said he,) will always make their appearance where they have a right to do it.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Of the same gentleman&rsquo;s mode of living, he said, &lsquo;Sir, the servants, instead of doing what they are bid, stand round the table in idle clusters, gaping upon the guests; and seem as unfit to attend a company, as to steer a man of war.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">A dull country magistrate gave Johnson a long tedious account of his exercising his criminal jurisdiction, the result of which was his having sentenced four convicts to transportation. Johnson, in an agony of impatience to get rid of such a companion, exclaimed, &lsquo;I heartily wish, Sir, that I were a fifth.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson was present when a tragedy was read, in which there occurred this line: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Who rules o&rsquo;er freemen should himself be free962.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">The company having admired it much, &lsquo;I cannot agree with you (said Johnson:) It might as well be said, &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Who drives fat oxen should himself be fat.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He was pleased with the kindness of Mr. Cator, who was joined with him in Mr. Thrale&rsquo;s important trust, and thus describes him:&mdash; &lsquo;There is much good in his character, and much usefulness in his knowledge.&rsquo; He found a cordial solace at that gentleman&rsquo;s seat at Beckenham, in Kent, which is indeed one of the finest places at which I ever was a guest; and where I find more and more a hospitable welcome.</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson seldom encouraged general censure of any profession; but he was willing to allow a due share of merit to the various departments necessary in civilised life. In a splenetick, sarcastical, or jocular frame, however, he would sometimes utter a pointed saying of that nature. One instance has been mentioned, where he gave a sudden satirical stroke to the character of an attorney<span class="t8">. The too indiscriminate admission to that employment, which requires both abilities and integrity, has given rise to injurious reflections, which are totally inapplicable to many very respectable men who exercise it with reputation and honour.</span></p>
<p class="p24">Johnson having argued for some time with a pertinacious gentleman; his opponent, who had talked in a very puzzling manner, happened to say, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t understand you, Sir:&rsquo; upon which Johnson observed, &lsquo;Sir, I have found you an argument; but I am not obliged to find you an understanding.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Talking to me of Horry Walpole, (as Horace late Earl of Orford was often called,) Johnson allowed that he got together a great many curious little things, and told them in an elegant manner. Mr. Walpole thought Johnson a more amiable character after reading his Letters to Mrs. Thrale<span class="t8">: but never was one of the true admirers of that great man. We may suppose a prejudice conceived, if he ever heard Johnson&rsquo;s account to Sir George Staunton, that when he made the speeches in parliament for the</span> Gentleman&rsquo;s Magazine<span class="t8">, &lsquo;he always took care to put Sir Robert Walpole in the wrong, and to say every thing he could against the electorate of Hanover.&rsquo; The celebrated</span> Heroick Epistle<span class="t8">, in which Johnson is satyrically introduced, has been ascribed both to Mr. Walpole and Mr. Mason. One day at Mr. Courtenay&rsquo;s, when a gentleman expressed his opinion that there was more energy in that poem than could be expected from Mr. Walpole; Mr. Warton, the late Laureat, observed, &lsquo;It may have been written by Walpole, and</span> buckram&rsquo;d <span class="t8">by Mason.&rsquo;</span></p>
<p class="p24">He disapproved of Lord Hailes, for having modernised the language of the ever-memorable John Hales of Eton, in an edition which his Lordship published of that writer&rsquo;s works. &lsquo;An authour&rsquo;s language, Sir, (said he,) is a characteristical part of his composition, and is also characteristical of the age in which he writes. Besides, Sir, when the language is changed we are not sure that the sense is the same. No, Sir; I am sorry Lord Hailes has done this.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Here it may be observed, that his frequent use of the expression, No, Sir<span class="t8">, was not always to intimate contradiction; for he would say so, when he was about to enforce an affirmative proposition which had not been denied, as in the instance last mentioned. I used to consider it as a kind of flag of defiance; as if he had said, &lsquo;Any argument you may offer against this, is not just. No, Sir, it is not.&rsquo; It was like Falstaff&rsquo;s &lsquo;I deny your Major.&rsquo;</span></p>
<p class="p24">Sir Joshua Reynolds having said that he took the altitude of a man&rsquo;s taste by his stories and his wit, and of his understanding by the remarks which he repeated; being always sure that he must be a weak man who quotes common things with an emphasis as if they were oracles; Johnson agreed with him; and Sir Joshua having also observed that the real character of a man was found out by his amusements, &mdash; Johnson added, &lsquo;Yes, Sir; no man is a hypocrite in his pleasures.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I have mentioned Johnson&rsquo;s general aversion to a pun. He once, however, endured one of mine. When we were talking of a numerous company in which he had distinguished himself highly, I said, &lsquo;Sir, you were a COD surrounded by smelts. Is not this enough for you? at a time too when you were not fishing <span class="t8">for a compliment?&rsquo; He laughed at this with a complacent approbation. Old Mr. Sheridan observed, upon my mentioning it to him, &lsquo;He liked your compliment so well, he was willing to take it with</span> pun sauce<span class="t8">.&rsquo; For my own part, I think no innocent species of wit or pleasantry should be suppressed; and that a good pun may be admitted among the smaller excellencies of lively conversation.</span></p>
<p class="p24">Had Johnson treated at large De Claris Oratoribus<span class="t8">, he might have given us an admirable work. When the Duke of Bedford attacked the ministry as vehemently as he could, for having taken upon them to extend the time for the importation of corn, Lord Chatham, in his first speech in the House of Lords, boldly avowed himself to be an adviser of that measure. &lsquo;My colleagues, (said he,) as I was confined by indisposition, did me the signal honour of coming to the bed-side of a sick man, to ask his opinion. But, had they not thus condescended, I should have</span> taken up my bed and walked<span class="t8">, in order to have delivered that opinion at the Council-Board.&rsquo; Mr. Langton, who was present, mentioned this to Johnson, who observed, &lsquo;Now, Sir, we see that he took these words as he found them; without considering, that though the expression in Scripture,</span> take up thy bed and walk<span class="t8">, strictly suited the instance of the sick man restored to health and strength, who would of course be supposed to carry his bed with him, it could not be proper in the case of a man who was lying in a state of feebleness, and who certainly would not add to the difficulty of moving at all, that of carrying his bed.&rsquo;</span></p>
<p class="p24">When I pointed out to him in the newspaper one of Mr. Grattan&rsquo;s animated and glowing speeches, in favour of the freedom of Ireland, in which this expression occurred (I know not if accurately taken): &lsquo;We will persevere, till there is not one link of the English chain left to clank upon the rags of the meanest beggar in Ireland;&rsquo; &lsquo;Nay, Sir, (said Johnson,) don&rsquo;t you perceive that one <span class="t8">link cannot clank?&rsquo;</span></p>
<p class="p24">Mrs. Thrale has published, as Johnson&rsquo;s, a kind of parody or counterpart of a fine poetical passage in one of Mr. Burke&rsquo;s speeches on American Taxation. It is vigorously but somewhat coarsely executed; and I am inclined to suppose, is not quite correctly exhibited. I hope he did not use the words &lsquo;vile agents&rsquo; <span class="t8">for the Americans in the House of Parliament; and if he did so, in an extempore effusion, I wish the lady had not committed it to writing.</span></p>
<p class="p24">Mr. Burke uniformly shewed Johnson the greatest respect; and when Mr. Townshend, now lord Sydney, at a period when he was conspicuous in opposition, threw out some reflection in parliament upon the grant of a pension to a man of such political principles as Johnson; Mr. Burke, though then of the same party with Mr. Townshend, stood warmly forth in defence of his friend, to whom, he justly observed, the pension was granted solely on account of his eminent literary merit. I am well assured, that Mr. Townshend&rsquo;s attack upon Johnson was the occasion of his &lsquo;hitching in a rhyme;&rsquo; for, that in the original copy of Goldsmith&rsquo;s character of Mr. Burke, in his Retaliation<span class="t8">, another person&rsquo;s name stood in the couplet where Mr. Townshend is now introduced: &mdash; </span></p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Though fraught with all learning kept984 straining his throat,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To persuade Tommy Townshend<span class="t8"> to lend him a vote.&rsquo;</span></p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p24">It may be worth remarking, among the minutiae <span class="t8">of my collection, that Johnson was once drawn to serve in the militia, the Trained Bands of the City of London, and that Mr. Rackstrow, of the Museum in Fleet-street, was his Colonel. It may be believed he did not serve in person; but the idea, with all its circumstances, is certainly laughable. He upon that occasion provided himself with a musket, and with a sword and belt, which I have seen hanging in his closet.</span></p>
<p class="p24">He was very constant to those whom he once employed, if they gave him no reason to be displeased. When somebody talked of being imposed on in the purchase of tea and sugar, and such articles: &lsquo;That will not be the case, (said he,) if you go to a stately shop<span class="t8">, as I always do. In such a shop it is not worth their while to take a petty advantage.&rsquo;</span></p>
<p class="p24">An authour of most anxious and restless vanity being mentioned, &lsquo;Sir, (said he,) there is not a young sapling upon Parnassus more severely blown about by every wind of criticism than that poor fellow.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">The difference, he observed, between a well-bred and an ill-bred man is this: &lsquo;One immediately attracts your liking, the other your aversion. You love the one till you find reason to hate him; you hate the other till you find reason to love him.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">The wife of one of his acquaintance had fraudulently made a purse for herself out of her husband&rsquo;s fortune. Feeling a proper compunction in her last moments, she confessed how much she had secreted; but before she could tell where it was placed, she was seized with a convulsive fit and expired. Her husband said, he was more hurt by her want of confidence in him, than by the loss of his money. &lsquo;I told him, (said Johnson,) that he should console himself: for perhaps <span class="t8">the money might be</span> found<span class="t8">, and he was</span> sure <span class="t8">that his wife was gone.&rsquo;</span></p>
<p class="p24">A foppish physician once reminded Johnson of his having been in company with him on a former occasion; &lsquo;I do not remember it, Sir.&rsquo; The physician still insisted; adding that he that day wore so fine a coat that it must have attracted his notice. &lsquo;Sir, (said Johnson,) had you been dipt in Pactolus I should not have noticed you.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He seemed to take a pleasure in speaking in his own style; for when he had carelessly missed it, he would repeat the thought translated into it. Talking of the Comedy of The Rehearsal<span class="t8">, he said, &lsquo;It has not wit enough to keep it sweet.&rsquo; This was easy; he therefore caught himself, and pronounced a more round sentence; &lsquo;It has not vitality enough to preserve it from putrefaction.&rsquo;</span></p>
<p class="p24">He censured a writer of entertaining Travels for assuming a feigned character, saying, (in his sense of the word,) &lsquo;He carries out one lye; we know not how many he brings back.&rsquo; At another time, talking of the same person, he observed, &lsquo;Sir, your assent to a man whom you have never known to falsify, is a debt: but after you have known a man to falsify, your assent to him then is a favour.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Though he had no taste for painting, he admired much the manner in which Sir Joshua Reynolds treated of his art, in his Discourses to the Royal Academy<span class="t8">. He observed one day of a passage in them, &lsquo;I think I might as well have said this myself: &lsquo;and once when Mr. Langton was sitting by him, he read one of them very eagerly, and expressed himself thus:&mdash; &lsquo;Very well, Master Reynolds; very well, indeed. But it will not be understood.&rsquo;</span></p>
<p class="p24">When I observed to him that Painting was so far inferiour to Poetry, that the story or even emblem which it communicates must be previously known, and mentioned as a natural and laughable instance of this, that a little Miss on seeing a picture of Justice with the scales, had exclaimed to me, &lsquo;See, there&rsquo;s a woman selling sweetmeats;&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;Painting, Sir, can illustrate, but cannot inform.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">No man was more ready to make an apology when he had censured unjustly, than Johnson. When a proof-sheet of one of his works was brought to him, he found fault with the mode in which a part of it was arranged, refused to read it, and in a passion desired that the compositor might be sent to him. The compositor was Mr. Manning, a decent sensible man, who had composed about one half of his Dictionary<span class="t8">, when in Mr. Strahan&rsquo;s printing-house; and a great part of his</span> Lives of the Poets<span class="t8">, when in that of Mr. Nichols; and who (in his seventy-seventh year), when in Mr. Baldwin&rsquo;s printing-house, composed a part of the first edition of this work concerning him. By producing the manuscript, he at once satisfied Dr. Johnson that he was not to blame. Upon which Johnson candidly and earnestly said to him, &lsquo;Mr. Compositor, I ask your pardon. Mr. Compositor, I ask your pardon, again and again.&rsquo;</span></p>
<p class="p24">His generous humanity to the miserable was almost beyond example. The following instance is well attested: &mdash; Coming home late one night, he found a poor woman lying in the street, so much exhausted that she could not walk; he took her upon his back, and carried her to his house, where he discovered that she was one of those wretched females who had fallen into the lowest state of vice, poverty, and disease. Instead of harshly upbraiding her, he had her taken care of with all tenderness for a long time, at considerable expence, till she was restored to health, and endeavoured to put her into a virtuous way of living.</p>
<p class="p24">He thought Mr. Caleb Whitefoord singularly happy in hitting on the signature of Papyrius Cursor<span class="t8">, to his ingenious and diverting cross-readings of the newspapers; it being a real name of an ancient Roman, and clearly expressive of the thing done in this lively conceit.</span></p>
<p class="p24">He once in his life was known to have uttered what is called a bull<span class="t8">: Sir Joshua Reynolds, when they were riding together in Devonshire, complained that he had a very bad horse, for that even when going down hill he moved slowly step by step. &lsquo;Ay (said Johnson,) and when he</span> goes <span class="t8">up hill, he</span> stands still<span class="t8">.&rsquo;</span></p>
<p class="p24">He had a great aversion to gesticulating in company. He called once to a gentleman who offended him in that point, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t attitudenise<span class="t8">.&rsquo; And when another gentleman thought he was giving additional force to what he uttered, by expressive movements of his hands, Johnson fairly seized them, and held them down.</span></p>
<p class="p24">An authour of considerable eminence having engrossed a good share of the conversation in the company of Johnson, and having said nothing but what was trifling and insignificant; Johnson when he was gone, observed to us, &lsquo;It is wonderful what a difference there sometimes is between a man&rsquo;s powers of writing and of talking. &mdash;&mdash; writes with great spirit, but is a poor talker; had he held his tongue we might have supposed him to have been restrained by modesty; but he has spoken a great deal to-day; and you have heard what stuff it was.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">A gentleman having said that a congé d&rsquo;élire<span class="t8"> has not, perhaps, the force of a command, but may be considered only as a strong recommendation; &lsquo;Sir, (replied Johnson, who overheard him,) it is such a recommendation, as if I should throw you out of a two-pair of stairs window, and recommend to you to fall soft.&rsquo;</span></p>
<p class="p24">Mr. Steevens, who passed many a social hour with him during their long acquaintance, which commenced when they both lived in the Temple, has preserved a good number of particulars concerning him, most of which are to be found in the department of Apothegms, &amp;c. in the Collection of Johnson&rsquo;s Works<span class="t8">. But he has been pleased to favour me with the following, which are original: &mdash; </span></p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;One evening, previous to the trial of Barretti, a consultation of his friends was held at the house of Mr. Cox, the Solicitor, in Southampton-buildings, Chancery-lane. Among others present were, Mr. Burke and Dr. Johnson, who differed in sentiments concerning the tendency of some part of the defence the prisoner was to make. When the meeting was over, Mr. Steevens observed, that the question between him and his friend had been agitated with rather too much warmth. &ldquo;It may be so, Sir, (replied the Doctor,) for Burke and I should have been of one opinion, if we had had no audience.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Dr. Johnson once assumed a character in which perhaps even Mr. Boswell never saw him. His curiosity having been excited by the praises bestowed on the celebrated Torré&rsquo;s fireworks at Marybone-Gardens, he desired Mr. Steevens to accompany him thither. The evening had proved showery; and soon after the few people present were assembled, publick notice was given, that the conductors to the wheels, suns, stars, &amp;c., were so thoroughly water-soaked, that it was impossible any part of the exhibition should be made. &ldquo;This is a mere excuse, (says the Doctor,) to save their crackers for a more profitable company. Let us but hold up our sticks, and threaten to break those coloured lamps that surround the Orchestra, and we shall soon have our wishes gratified. The core of the fireworks cannot be injured; let the different pieces be touched in their respective centers, and they will do their offices as well as ever.&rdquo; Some young men who overheard him, immediately began the violence he had recommended, and an attempt was speedily made to fire some of the wheels which appeared to have received the smallest damage; but to little purpose were they lighted, for most of them completely failed. The authour of The Rambler<span class="t8">, however, may be considered, on this occasion, as the ringleader of a successful riot, though not as a skilful pyrotechnist.&rsquo;</span></p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;It has been supposed that Dr. Johnson, so far as fashion was concerned, was careless of his appearance in publick. But this is not altogether true, as the following slight instance may show: &mdash; Goldsmith&rsquo;s last Comedy was to be represented during some court-mourning: and Mr. Steevens appointed to call on Dr. Johnson, and carry him to the tavern where he was to dine with others of the Poet&rsquo;s friends. The Doctor was ready dressed, but in coloured cloaths; yet being told that he would find every one else in black, received the intelligence with a profusion of thanks, hastened to change his attire, all the while repeating his gratitude for the information that had saved him from an appearance so improper in the front row of a front box. &ldquo;I would not (added he,) for ten pounds, have seemed so retrograde to any general observance.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;He would sometimes found his dislikes on very slender circumstances. Happening one day to mention Mr. Flexman, a Dissenting Minister, with some compliment to his exact memory in chronological matters; the Doctor replied, &ldquo;Let me hear no more of him, Sir. That is the fellow who made the Index to my Ramblers<span class="t8">, and set down the name of Milton thus: Milton,</span> Mr<span class="t8">. John.&rdquo;&rsquo;</span></p>
<p class="p24">Mr. Steevens adds this testimony: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;It is unfortunate, however, for Johnson, that his particularities and frailties can be more distinctly traced than his good and amiable exertions. Could the many bounties he studiously concealed, the many acts of humanity he performed in private, be displayed with equal circumstantiality, his defects would be so far lost in the blaze of his virtues, that the latter only would be regarded.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Though from my very high admiration of Johnson, I have wondered that he was not courted by all the great and all the eminent persons of his time, it ought fairly to be considered, that no man of humble birth, who lived entirely by literature, in short no authour by profession, ever rose in this country into that personal notice which he did. In the course of this work a numerous variety of names has been mentioned, to which many might be added. I cannot omit Lord and Lady Lucan, at whose house he often enjoyed all that an elegant table and the best company can contribute to happiness; he found hospitality united with extraordinary accomplishments, and embellished with charms of which no man could be insensible.</p>
<p class="p24">On Tuesday, June 22, I dined with him at THE LITERARY CLUB, the last time of his being in that respectable society. The other members present were the Bishop of St. Asaph, Lord Eliot, Lord Palmerston, Dr. Fordyce, and Mr. Malone. He looked ill; but had such a manly fortitude, that he did not trouble the company with melancholy complaints. They all shewed evident marks of kind concern about him, with which he was much pleased, and he exerted himself to be as entertaining as his indisposition allowed him.</p>
<p class="p24">The anxiety of his friends to preserve so estimable a life, as long as human means might be supposed to have influence, made them plan for him a retreat from the severity of a British winter, to the mild climate of Italy. This scheme was at last brought to a serious resolution at General Paoli&rsquo;s, where I had often talked of it. One essential matter, however, I understood was necessary to be previously settled, which was obtaining such an addition to his income, as would be sufficient to enable him to defray the expence in a manner becoming the first literary character of a great nation, and, independent of all his other merits, the Authour of THE DICTIONARY OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE. The person to whom I above all others thought I should apply to negociate this business, was the Lord Chancellor, because I knew that he highly valued Johnson, and that Johnson highly valued his Lordship; so that it was no degradation of my illustrious friend to solicit for him the favour of such a man. I have mentioned what Johnson said of him to me when he was at the bar; and after his Lordship was advanced to the seals, he said of him, &lsquo;I would prepare myself for no man in England but Lord Thurlow. When I am to meet with him I should wish to know a day before&rsquo;. How he would have prepared himself I cannot conjecture. Would he have selected certain topicks, and considered them in every view so as to be in readiness to argue them at all points? and what may we suppose those topicks to have been? I once started the curious enquiry to the great man who was the subject of this compliment: he smiled, but did not pursue it.</p>
<p class="p24">I first consulted with Sir Joshua Reynolds, who perfectly coincided in opinion with me; and I therefore, though personally very little known to his Lordship, wrote to him, stating the case, and requesting his good offices for Dr. Johnson. I mentioned that I was obliged to set out for Scotland early in the following week, so that if his Lordship should have any commands for me as to this pious negociation, he would be pleased to send them before that time; otherwise Sir Joshua Reynolds would give all attention to it.</p>
<p class="p24">This application was made not only without any suggestion on the part of Johnson himself, but was utterly unknown to him, nor had he the smallest suspicion of it. Any insinuations, therefore, which since his death have been thrown out, as if he had stooped to ask what was superfluous, are without any foundation. But, had he asked it, it would not have been superfluous; for though the money he had saved proved to be more than his friends imagined, or than I believe he himself, in his carelessness concerning worldly matters, knew it to be, had he travelled upon the Continent, an augmentation of his income would by no means have been unnecessary.</p>
<p class="p24">On Wednesday, June 23, I visited him in the morning, after having been present at the shocking sight of fifteen men executed before Newgate. I said to him, I was sure that human life was not machinery, that is to say, a chain of fatality planned and directed by the Supreme Being, as it had in it so much wickedness and misery, so many instances of both, as that by which my mind was now clouded. Were it machinery it would be better than it is in these respects, though less noble, as not being a system of moral government. He agreed with me now, as he always did, upon the great question of the liberty of the human will, which has been in all ages perplexed with so much sophistry. &lsquo;But, Sir, as to the doctrine of Necessity, no man believes it. If a man should give me arguments that I do not see, though I could not answer them, should I believe that I do not see?&rsquo; It will be observed, that Johnson at all times made the just distinction between doctrines contrary <span class="t8">to reason, and doctrines</span> above <span class="t8">reason.</span></p>
<p class="p24">Talking of the religious discipline proper for unhappy convicts, he said, &lsquo;Sir, one of our regular clergy will probably not impress their minds sufficiently: they should be attended by a Methodist preacher; or a Popish priest.&rsquo; Let me however observe, in justice to the Reverend Mr. Vilette, who has been Ordinary of Newgate for no less than eighteen years, in the course of which he has attended many hundreds of wretched criminals, that his earnest and humane exhortations have been very effectual. His extraordinary diligence is highly praiseworthy, and merits a distinguished reward.</p>
<p class="p24">On Thursday, June 24, I dined with him at Mr. Dilly&rsquo;s, where were the Rev. Mr. (now Dr.) Knox, master of Tunbridge-school, Mr. Smith, Vicar of Southill, Dr. Beattie, Mr. Pinkerton, authour of various literary performances, and the Rev. Dr. Mayo. At my desire old Mr. Sheridan was invited, as I was earnest to have Johnson and him brought together again by chance, that a reconciliation might be effected. Mr. Sheridan happened to come early, and having learned that Dr. Johnson was to be there, went away; so I found, with sincere regret, that my friendly intentions were hopeless. I recollect nothing that passed this day, except Johnson&rsquo;s quickness, who, when Dr. Beattie observed, as something remarkable which had happened to him, that he had chanced to see both No. 1, and No. 1000, of the hackney-coaches, the first and the last; &lsquo;Why, Sir, (said Johnson,) there is an equal chance for one&rsquo;s seeing those two numbers as any other two.&rsquo; He was clearly right; yet the seeing of the two extremes, each of which is in some degree more conspicuous than the rest, could not but strike one in a stronger manner than the sight of any other two numbers. Though I have neglected to preserve his conversation, it was perhaps at this interview that Dr. Knox formed the notion of it which he has exhibited in his Winter Evenings<span class="t8">.</span></p>
<p class="p24">On Friday, June 25, I dined with him at General Paoli&rsquo;s, where, he says in one of his letters to Mrs. Thrale, &lsquo;I love to dine.&rsquo; There was a variety of dishes much to his taste, of all which he seemed to me to eat so much, that I was afraid he might be hurt by it; and I whispered to the General my fear, and begged he might not press him. &lsquo;Alas! (said the General,) see how very ill he looks; he can live but a very short time. Would you refuse any slight gratifications to a man under sentence of death? There is a humane custom in Italy, by which persons in that melancholy situation are indulged with having whatever they like best to eat and drink, even with expensive delicacies.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I shewed him some verses on Lichfield by Miss Seward, which I had that day received from her, and had the pleasure to hear him approve of them. He confirmed to me the truth of a high compliment which I had been told he had paid to that lady, when she mentioned to him The Colombiade<span class="t8">, an epick poem, by Madame du Boccage:&mdash; &lsquo;Madam, there is not any thing equal to your description of the sea round the North Pole, in your Ode on the death of Captain Cook.&rsquo;</span></p>
<p class="p24">On Sunday, June 27, I found him rather better. I mentioned to him a young man who was going to Jamaica with his wife and children, in expectation of being provided for by two of her brothers settled in that island, one a clergyman, and the other a physician. JOHNSON. &lsquo;It is a wild scheme, Sir, unless he has a positive and deliberate invitation. There was a poor girl, who used to come about me, who had a cousin in Barbadoes, that, in a letter to her, expressed a wish she should come out to that Island, and expatiated on the comforts and happiness of her situation. The poor girl went out: her cousin was much surprised, and asked her how she could think of coming. &ldquo;Because, (said she,) you invited me.&rdquo; &ldquo;Not I,&rdquo; answered the cousin. The letter was then produced. &ldquo;I see it is true, (said she,) that I did invite you: but I did not think you would come.&rdquo; They lodged her in an out-house, where she passed her time miserably; and as soon as she had an opportunity she returned to England. Always tell this, when you hear of people going abroad to relations, upon a notion of being well received. In the case which you mention, it is probable the clergyman spends all he gets, and the physician does not know how much he is to get.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">We this day dined at Sir Joshua Reynolds&rsquo;s, with General Paoli, Lord Eliot, (formerly Mr. Eliot, of Port Eliot,) Dr. Beattie, and some other company. Talking of Lord Chesterfield; &mdash; JOHNSON. &lsquo;His manner was exquisitely elegant, and he had more knowledge than I expected.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Did you find, Sir, his conversation to be of a superiour style?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, in the conversation which I had with him I had the best right to superiority, for it was upon philology and literature.&rsquo; Lord Eliot, who had travelled at the same time with Mr. Stanhope, Lord Chesterfield&rsquo;s natural son, justly observed, that it was strange that a man who shewed he had so much affection for his son as Lord Chesterfield did, by writing so many long and anxious letters to him, almost all of them when he was Secretary of State, which certainly was a proof of great goodness of disposition, should endeavour to make his son a rascal. His Lordship told us, that Foote had intended to bring on the stage a father who had thus tutored his son, and to shew the son an honest man to every one else, but practising his father&rsquo;s maxims upon him, and cheating him. JOHNSON. &lsquo;I am much pleased with this design; but I think there was no occasion to make the son honest at all. No; he should be a consummate rogue: the contrast between honesty and knavery would be the stronger. It should be contrived so that the father should be the only sufferer by the son&rsquo;s villainy, and thus there would be poetical justice.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He put Lord Eliot in mind of Dr. Walter Harte. &lsquo;I know (said he,) Harte was your Lordship&rsquo;s tutor, and he was also tutor to the Peterborough family. Pray, my Lord, do you recollect any particulars that he told you of Lord Peterborough? He is a favourite of mine, and is not enough known; his character has been only ventilated in party pamphlets.&rsquo; Lord Eliot said, if Dr. Johnson would be so good as to ask him any questions, he would tell what he could recollect. Accordingly some things were mentioned. &lsquo;But, (said his Lordship,) the best account of Lord Peterborough that I have happened to meet with, is in Captain Carleton&rsquo;s Memoirs<span class="t8">. Carleton was descended of an ancestor who had distinguished himself at the siege of Derry. He was an officer; and, what was rare at that time, had some knowledge of engineering.&rsquo; Johnson said, he had never heard of the book. Lord Eliot had it at Port Eliot; but, after a good deal of enquiry, procured a copy in London, and sent it to Johnson, who told Sir Joshua Reynolds that he was going to bed when it came, but was so much pleased with it, that he sat up till he had read it through, and found in it such an air of truth, that he could not doubt of its authenticity; adding, with a smile, (in allusion to Lord Eliot&rsquo;s having recently been raised to the peerage,) &lsquo;I did not think a</span> young Lord <span class="t8">could have mentioned to me a book in the English history that was not known to me.&rsquo;</span></p>
<p class="p24">An addition to our company came after we went up to the drawing-room; Dr. Johnson seemed to rise in spirits as his audience increased. He said, &lsquo;He wished Lord Orford&rsquo;s pictures, and Sir Ashton Lever&rsquo;s Museum, might be purchased by the publick, because both the money, and the pictures, and the curiosities, would remain in the country; whereas, if they were sold into another kingdom, the nation would indeed get some money, but would lose the pictures and curiosities, which it would be desirable we should have, for improvement in taste and natural history. The only question was, as the nation was much in want of money, whether it would not be better to take a large price from a foreign State?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He entered upon a curious discussion of the difference between intuition and sagacity; one being immediate in its effect, the other requiring a circuitous process; one he observed was the eye <span class="t8">of the mind, the other the</span> nose <span class="t8">of the mind.</span></p>
<p class="p24">A young gentleman present took up the argument against him, and maintained that no man ever thinks of the nose of the mind<span class="t8">, not adverting that though that figurative sense seems strange to us, as very unusual, it is truly not more forced than Hamlet&rsquo;s &lsquo;In my</span> mind&rsquo;s eye<span class="t8">, Horatio.&rsquo; He persisted much too long, and appeared to Johnson as putting himself forward as his antagonist with too much presumption; upon which he called to him in a loud tone, &lsquo;What is it you are contending for, if you</span> be <span class="t8">contending?&rsquo; And afterwards imagining that the gentleman retorted upon him with a kind of smart drollery, he said, &lsquo;Mr. &mdash;&mdash; , it does not become you to talk so to me. Besides, ridicule is not your talent; you have</span> there <span class="t8">neither intuition nor sagacity.&rsquo; The gentleman protested that he had intended no improper freedom, but had the greatest respect for Dr. Johnson. After a short pause, during which we were somewhat uneasy, &mdash; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Give me your hand, Sir. You were too tedious, and I was too short.&rsquo; MR. &mdash;&mdash; . &lsquo;Sir, I am honoured by your attention in any way.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Come, Sir, let&rsquo;s have no more of it. We offended one another by our contention; let us not offend the company by our compliments.&rsquo;</span></p>
<p class="p24">He now said, &lsquo;He wished much to go to Italy, and that he dreaded passing the winter in England.&rsquo; I said nothing; but enjoyed a secret satisfaction in thinking that I had taken the most effectual measures to make such a scheme practicable.</p>
<p class="p24">On Monday, June 28, I had the honour to receive from the Lord Chancellor the following letter: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;TO JAMES BOSWELL, ESQ. SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">I should have answered your letter immediately, if, (being much engaged when I received it) I had not put it in my pocket, and forgot to open it till this morning.</p>
<p class="p24">I am much obliged to you for the suggestion; and I will adopt and press it as far as I can. The best argument, I am sure, and I hope it is not likely to fail, is Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s merit. But it will be necessary, if I should be so unfortunate as to miss seeing you, to converse with Sir Joshua on the sum it will be proper to ask, &mdash; it short, upon the means of setting him out. It would be a reflection on us all, if such a man should perish for want of the means to take care of his health.</p>
<p class="p24">Yours, &amp;c. THURLOW.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">This letter gave me a very high satisfaction; I next day went and shewed it to Sir Joshua Reynolds, who was exceedingly pleased with it. He thought that I should now communicate the negociation to Dr. Johnson, who might afterwards complain if the attention with which he had been honoured, should be too long concealed from him. I intended to set out for Scotland next morning; but Sir Joshua cordially insisted that I should stay another day, that Johnson and I might dine with him, that we three might talk of his Italian Tour, and, as Sir Joshua expressed himself, &lsquo;have it all out.&rsquo; I hastened to Johnson, and was told by him that he was rather better to-day. BOSWELL. &lsquo;I am very anxious about you, Sir, and particularly that you should go to Italy for the winter, which I believe is your own wish.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;It is, Sir.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;You have no objection, I presume, but the money it would require.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, no, Sir.&rsquo; Upon which I gave him a particular account of what had been done, and read to him the Lord Chancellor&rsquo;s letter. He listened with much attention; then warmly said, &lsquo;This is taking prodigious pains about a man.&rsquo; &lsquo;O! Sir, (said I, with most sincere affection,) your friends would do every thing for you.&rsquo; He paused, grew more and more agitated, till tears started into his eyes, and he exclaimed with fervent emotion, &lsquo;GOD bless you all.&rsquo; I was so affected that I also shed tears. After a short silence, he renewed and extended his grateful benediction, &lsquo;GOD bless you all, for JESUS CHRIST&rsquo;S sake.&rsquo; We both remained for some time unable to speak. He rose suddenly and quitted the room, quite melted in tenderness. He staid but a short time, till he had recovered his firmness; soon after he returned I left him, having first engaged him to dine at Sir Joshua Reynolds&rsquo;s, next day. I never was again under that roof which I had so long reverenced.</p>
<p class="p24">On Wednesday, June 30, the friendly confidential dinner with Sir Joshua Reynolds took place, no other company being present. Had I known that this was the last time that I should enjoy in this world, the conversation of a friend whom I so much respected, and from whom I derived so much instruction and entertainment, I should have been deeply affected. When I now look back to it, I am vexed that a single word should have been forgotten.</p>
<p class="p24">Both Sir Joshua and I were so sanguine in our expectations, that we expatiated with confidence on the liberal provision which we were sure would be made for him, conjecturing whether munificence would be displayed in one large donation, or in an ample increase of his pension. He himself catched so much of our enthusiasm, as to allow himself to suppose it not impossible that our hopes might in one way or other be realised. He said that he would rather have his pension doubled than a grant of a thousand pounds; &lsquo;For, (said he,) though probably I may not live to receive as much as a thousand pounds, a man would have the consciousness that he should pass the remainder of his life in splendour, how long soever it might be.&rsquo; Considering what a moderate proportion an income of six hundred pounds a year bears to innumerable fortunes in this country, it is worthy of remark, that a man so truly great should think it splendour.</p>
<p class="p24">As an instance of extraordinary liberality of friendship, he told us, that Dr. Brocklesby had upon this occasion offered him a hundred a year for his life. A grateful tear started into his eye, as he spoke this in a faultering tone.</p>
<p class="p24">Sir Joshua and I endeavoured to flatter his imagination with agreeable prospects of happiness in Italy. &lsquo;Nay, (said he,) I must not expect much of that; when a man goes to Italy merely to feel how he breathes the air, he can enjoy very little.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Our conversation turned upon living in the country, which Johnson, whose melancholy mind required the dissipation of quick successive variety, had habituated himself to consider as a kind of mental imprisonment. &lsquo;Yet, Sir, (said I,) there are many people who are content to live in the country.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, it is in the intellectual world as in the physical world; we are told by natural philosophers that a body is at rest in the place that is fit for it; they who are content to live in the country, are fit <span class="t8">for the country.&rsquo;</span></p>
<p class="p24">Talking of various enjoyments, I argued that a refinement of taste was a disadvantage, as they who have attained to it must be seldomer pleased than those who have no nice discrimination, and are therefore satisfied with every thing that comes in their way. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Nay, Sir; that is a paltry notion. Endeavour to be as perfect as you can in every respect.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I accompanied him in Sir Joshua Reynolds&rsquo;s coach, to the entry of Bolt-court. He asked me whether I would not go with him to his house; I declined it, from an apprehension that my spirits would sink. We bade adieu to each other affectionately in the carriage. When he had got down upon the foot-pavement, he called out, &lsquo;Fare you well;&rsquo; and without looking back, sprung away with a kind of pathetick briskness, if I may use that expression, which seemed to indicate a struggle to conceal uneasiness, and impressed me with a foreboding of our long, long separation.</p>
<p class="p24">I remained one day more in town, to have the chance of talking over my negociation with the Lord Chancellor; but the multiplicity of his Lordship&rsquo;s important engagements did not allow of it; so I left the management of the business in the hands of Sir Joshua Reynolds.</p>
<p class="p24">Soon after this time Dr. Johnson had the mortification of being informed by Mrs. Thrale, that, &lsquo;what she supposed he never believed,&rsquo; was true; namely, that she was actually going to marry Signor Piozzi, an Italian musick-master. He endeavoured to prevent it; but in vain. If she would publish the whole of the correspondence that passed between Dr. Johnson and her on the subject, we should have a full view of his real sentiments. As it is, our judgement must be biassed by that characteristick specimen which Sir John Hawkins has given us: &lsquo;Poor Thrale! I thought that either her virtue or her vice would have restrained her from such a marriage. She is now become a subject for her enemies to exult over; and for her friends, if she has any left, to forget, or pity.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">It must be admitted that Johnson derived a considerable portion of happiness from the comforts and elegancies which he enjoyed in Mr. Thrale&rsquo;s family; but Mrs. Thrale assures us he was indebted for these to her husband alone, who certainly respected him sincerely. Her words are, &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Veneration for his virtue, reverence for his talents<span class="t8">, delight</span> in his conversation, and <span class="t8">habitual endurance of a yoke my husband first put upon me,</span> and of which he contentedly bore his share for sixteen or seventeen years, made me go on so long with <span class="t8">Mr. Johnson;</span> but the perpetual confinement I will own to have been <span class="t8">terrifying</span> in the first years of our friendship, and <span class="t8">irksome</span> in the last; nor could I pretend to support <span class="t8">it without help, when my coadjutor was no more</span>.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Alas! how different is this from the declarations which I have heard Mrs. Thrale make in his life-time, without a single murmur against any peculiarities, or against any one circumstance which attended their intimacy.</p>
<p class="p24">As a sincere friend of the great man whose <span class="t8">Life</span> I am writing, I think it necessary to guard my readers against the mistaken notion of Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s character, which this lady&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Anecdotes</span> of him suggest; for from the very nature and form of her book, &lsquo;it lends deception lighter wings to fly&rsquo;.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Let it be remembered, (says an eminent critick,) that she has comprised in a small volume all that she could recollect of Dr. Johnson in <span class="t8">twenty years</span>, during which period, doubtless, some severe things were said by him; and they who read the book in <span class="t8">two hours</span>, naturally enough suppose that his whole conversation was of this complexion. But the fact is, I have been often in his company, and never <span class="t8">once</span> heard him say a severe thing to any one; and many others can attest the same. When he did say a severe thing, it was generally extorted by ignorance pretending to knowledge, or by extreme vanity or affectation.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Two instances of inaccuracy, (adds he,) are peculiarly worthy of notice:</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;It is said, <span class="t8">&ldquo;That natural roughness of his manner so often mentioned, would, notwithstanding the regularity of his notions, burst through them all from time to time; and he once bade a very celebrated lady, who praised him with too much zeal perhaps, or perhaps too strong an emphasis, (which always offended him,) consider what her flattery was worth, before she choaked him with it.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Now let the genuine anecdote be contrasted with this. The person thus represented as being harshly treated, though a very celebrated lady, was <span class="t8">then</span> just come to London from an obscure situation in the country. At Sir Joshua Reynolds&rsquo;s one evening, she met Dr. Johnson. She very soon began to pay her court to him in the most fulsome strain. &ldquo;Spare me, I beseech you, dear Madam,&rdquo; was his reply. She still <span class="t8">laid it on</span>. &ldquo;Pray, Madam, let us have no more of this;&rdquo; he rejoined. Not paying any attention to these warnings, she continued still her eulogy. At length, provoked by this indelicate and vain obtrusion of compliment, he exclaimed, &ldquo;Dearest lady, consider with yourself what your flattery is worth, before you bestow it so freely.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;How different does this story appear, when accompanied with all these circumstances which really belong to it, but which Mrs. Thrale either did not know, or has suppressed.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;She says, in another place, <span class="t8">&ldquo;One gentleman, however, who dined at a nobleman&rsquo;s house in his company, and that of</span> Mr. Thrale, <span class="t8">to whom I was obliged for the anecdote, was willing to enter the lists in defence of</span> King William&rsquo;s <span class="t8">character; and having opposed and contradicted</span> Johnson <span class="t8">two or three times, petulantly enough, the master of the house began to feel uneasy, and expect disagreeable consequences; to avoid which, he said, loud enough for the Doctor to hear,&mdash; &lsquo;Our friend here has no meaning now in all this, except just to relate at club to-morrow how he teized</span> Johnson <span class="t8">at dinner to-day; this is all to do himself</span> honour.&rsquo; <span class="t8">No, upon my word, (replied the other,&rsquo;) I see no</span> honour <span class="t8">in it, whatever you may do. Well, Sir, (returned</span> Mr. Johnson, <span class="t8">sternly,) if you do not</span> see <span class="t8">the honour, I am sure I</span> feel <span class="t8">the disgrace</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;This is all sophisticated. Mr. Thrale was <span class="t8">not</span> in the company, though he might have related the story to Mrs. Thrale. A friend, from whom I had the story, was present; and it was <span class="t8">not</span> at the house of a nobleman. On the observation being made by the master of the house on a gentleman&rsquo;s contradicting Johnson, that he had talked for the honour, &amp;c., the gentleman muttered in a low voice, &ldquo;I see no honour in it;&rdquo; and Dr. Johnson said nothing: so all the rest, (though <span class="t8">bien trouvée</span>) is mere garnish.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I have had occasion several times, in the course of this work, to point out the incorrectness of Mrs. Thrale, as to particulars which consisted with my own knowledge. But indeed she has, in flippant terms enough, expressed her disapprobation of that anxious desire of authenticity which prompts a person who is to record conversations, to write them down <span class="t8">at the moment</span>. Unquestionably, if they are to be recorded at all, the sooner it is done the better. This lady herself says, &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">&lsquo;To recollect, however, and to repeat the sayings of</span> Dr. Johnson, <span class="t8">is almost all that can be done by the writers of his Life; as his life, at least since my acquaintance with him, consisted in little else than talking, when he was not [absolutely] employed in some serious piece of work.&rsquo;</span></p>
<p class="p24">She boasts of her having kept a common-place book; and we find she noted, at one time or other, in a very lively manner, specimens of the conversation of Dr. Johnson, and of those who talked with him; but had she done it recently, they probably would have been less erroneous; and we should have been relieved from those disagreeable doubts of their authenticity, with which we must now peruse them.</p>
<p class="p24">She says of him, &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">&lsquo;He was the most charitable of mortals, without being what we call an</span> active friend. <span class="t8">Admirable at giving counsel; no man saw his way so clearly; but he</span> would not stir a finger <span class="t8">for the assistance of those to whom he was willing enough to give advice.&rsquo;</span> And again on the same page, <span class="t8">&lsquo;If you wanted a slight favour, you must apply to people of other dispositions; for</span> not a step would Johnson move <span class="t8">to obtain a man a vote in a society, to repay a compliment which might be useful or pleasing, to write a letter of request, &amp;c., or to obtain a hundred pounds a year more for a friend who, perhaps, had already two or three. No force could urge him to diligence, no importunity could conquer his resolution to stand still.&rsquo;</span></p>
<p class="p24">It is amazing that one who had such opportunities of knowing Dr. Johnson, should appear so little acquainted with his real character. I am sorry this lady does not advert, that she herself contradicts the assertion of his being obstinately defective in the <span class="t8">petites morales</span>, in the little endearing charities of social life, in conferring smaller favours; for she says, &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Dr. Johnson <span class="t8">was liberal enough in granting literary assistance to others, I think; and innumerable are the Prefaces, Sermons, Lectures, and Dedications which he used to make for people who begged of him.</span>&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I am certain that a <span class="t8">more active friend</span> has rarely been found in any age. This work, which I fondly hope will rescue his memory from obloquy, contains a thousand instances of his benevolent exertions in almost every way that can be conceived; and particularly in employing his pen with a generous readiness for those to whom its aid could be useful. Indeed his obliging activity in doing little offices of kindness, both by letters and personal application, was one of the most remarkable features in his character; and for the truth of this I can appeal to a number of his respectable friends: Sir Joshua Reynolds, Mr. Langton, Mr. Hamilton, Mr. Burke, Mr. Windham, Mr. Malone, the Bishop of Dromore, Sir William Scott, Sir Robert Chambers. And can Mrs. Thrale forget the advertisements which he wrote for her husband at the time of his election contest; the epitaphs on him and her mother; the playful and even trifling verses, for the amusement of her and her daughters; his corresponding with her children, and entering into their minute concerns, which shews him in the most amiable light? She relates, &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">That Mr. Ch-lm-ley unexpectedly rode up to Mr. Thrale&rsquo;s carriage, in which Mr. Thrale and she, and Dr. Johnson were travelling; that he paid them all his proper compliments, but observing that Dr. Johnson, who was reading, did not see him, <span class="t8">&lsquo;tapt him gently on the shoulder. &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis</span> Mr. Ch-lm-ley;&rdquo; <span class="t8">says my husband. &ldquo;Well, Sir &mdash; and what if it is</span> Mr. Ch-lm-ley;&rdquo; <span class="t8">says the other, sternly, just lifting his eyes a moment from his book, and returning to it again, with renewed avidity.&rsquo;</span></p>
<p class="p24">This surely conveys a notion of Johnson, as if he had been grossly rude to Mr. Cholmondeley, a gentleman whom he always loved and esteemed. If, therefore, there was an absolute necessity for mentioning the story at all, it might have been thought that her tenderness for Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s character would have disposed her to state any thing that could soften it. Why then is there a total silence as to what Mr. Cholmondeley told her? &mdash; that Johnson, who had known him from his earliest years, having been made sensible of what had doubtless a strange appearance, took occasion, when he afterwards met him, to make a very courteous and kind apology. There is another little circumstance which I cannot but remark. Her book was published in 1785, she had then in her possession a letter from Dr. Johnson, dated in 1777, which begins thus:&mdash; &lsquo;Cholmondeley&rsquo;s story shocks me, if it be true, which I can hardly think, for I am utterly unconscious of it: I am very sorry, and very much ashamed.&rsquo; Why then publish the anecdote? Or if she did, why not add the circumstances, with which she was well acquainted!</p>
<p class="p24">In his social intercourse she thus describes him: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;<span class="t8">Ever musing till he was called out to converse, and conversing till the fatigue of his friends, or the promptitude of his own temper to take offence, consigned him back again to silent meditation</span>.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Yet, in the same book, she tells us, &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;<span class="t8">He was, however, seldom inclined to be silent, when any moral or literary question was started; and it was on such occasions that, like the Sage in</span> &ldquo;Rasselas,&rdquo; <span class="t8">he spoke, and attention watched his lips; he reasoned, and conviction closed his periods</span>.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">His conversation, indeed, was so far from ever <span class="t8">fatiguing</span> his friends, that they regretted when it was interrupted, or ceased, and could exclaim in Milton&rsquo;s language, &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;With thee conversing, I forget all time.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I certainly, then, do not claim too much in behalf of my illustrious friend in saying, that however smart and entertaining Mrs. Thrale&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Anecdotes</span> are, they must not be held as good evidence against him; for wherever an instance of harshness and severity is told, I beg leave to doubt its perfect authenticity; for though there may have been <span class="t8">some</span> foundation for it, yet, like that of his reproof to the &lsquo;very celebrated lady,&rsquo; it may be so exhibited in the narration as to be very unlike the real fact.</p>
<p class="p24">The evident tendency of the following anecdote is to represent Dr. Johnson as extremely deficient in affection, tenderness, or even common civility: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">&lsquo;When I one day lamented the loss of a first cousin killed in</span> America,&mdash; &ldquo;<span class="t8">Prithee, my dear, (said he,) have done with canting; how would the world be the worse for it, I may ask, if all your relations were at once spitted like larks, and roasted for</span> Presto&rsquo;s <span class="t8">supper?&rdquo;</span> &mdash; Presto <span class="t8">was the dog that lay under the table while we talked.</span>&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I suspect this too of exaggeration and distortion. I allow that he made her an angry speech; but let the circumstances fairly appear, as told by Mr. Baretti, who was present: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Mrs. Thrale, while supping very heartily upon larks, laid down her knife and fork, and abruptly exclaimed, &ldquo;O, my dear Mr. Johnson, do you know what has happened? The last letters from abroad have brought us an account that our poor cousin&rsquo;s head was taken off by a cannon-ball.&rdquo; Johnson, who was shocked both at the fact, and her light unfeeling manner of mentioning it, replied, &ldquo;Madam, it would give <span class="t8">you</span> very little concern if all your relations were spitted like those larks, and drest for Presto&rsquo;s supper.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">It is with concern that I find myself obliged to animadvert on the inaccuracies of Mrs. Piozzi&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Anecdotes</span>, and perhaps I may be thought to have dwelt too long upon her little collection. But as from Johnson&rsquo;s long residence under Mr. Thrale&rsquo;s roof, and his intimacy with her, the account which she has given of him may have made an unfavourable and unjust impression, my duty, as a faithful biographer, has obliged me reluctantly to perform this unpleasing task.</p>
<p class="p24">Having left the <span class="t8">pious negotiation</span>, as I called it, in the best hands, I shall here insert what relates to it. Johnson wrote to Sir Joshua Reynolds on July 6, as follows: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am going, I hope, in a few days, to try the air of Derbyshire, but hope to see you before I go. Let me, however, mention to you what I have much at heart. If the Chancellor should continue his attention to Mr. Boswell&rsquo;s request, and confer with you on the means of relieving my languid state, I am very desirous to avoid the appearance of asking money upon false pretences. I desire you to represent to his Lordship, what, as soon as it is suggested, he will perceive to be reasonable, &mdash; That, if I grow much worse, I shall be afraid to leave my physicians, to suffer the inconveniences of travel, and pine in the solitude of a foreign country; That, if I grow much better, of which indeed there is now little appearance, I shall not wish to leave my friends and my domestick comforts; for I do not travel for pleasure or curiosity; yet if I should recover, curiosity would revive. In my present state, I am desirous to make a struggle for a little longer life, and hope to obtain some help from a softer climate. Do for me what you can.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He wrote to me July 26: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I wish your affairs could have permitted a longer and continued exertion of your zeal and kindness. They that have your kindness may want your ardour. In the mean time I am very feeble and very dejected.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">By a letter from Sir Joshua Reynolds I was informed, that the Lord Chancellor had called on him, and acquainted him that the application had not been successful; but that his Lordship, after speaking highly in praise of Johnson, as a man who was an honour to his country, desired Sir Joshua to let him know, that on granting a mortgage of his pension, he should draw on his Lordship to the amount of five or six hundred pounds; and that his Lordship explained the meaning of the mortgage to be, that he wished the business to be conducted in such a manner, that Dr. Johnson should appear to be under the least possible obligation. Sir Joshua mentioned, that he had by the same post communicated all this to Dr. Johnson.</p>
<p class="p24">How Johnson was affected upon the occasion will appear from what he wrote to Sir Joshua Reynolds: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Ashbourne, Sept. 9. Many words I hope are not necessary between you and me, to convince you what gratitude is excited in my heart by the Chancellor&rsquo;s liberality, and your kind offices.... I have enclosed a letter to the Chancellor, which, when you have read it, you will be pleased to seal with a head, or any other general seal, and convey it to him: had I sent it directly to him, I should have seemed to overlook the favour of your intervention.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To THE LORD HIGH CHANCELLOR.</p>
<p class="p24">MY LORD, After a long and not inattentive observation of mankind, the generosity of your Lordship&rsquo;s offer raises in me not less wonder than gratitude. Bounty, so liberally bestowed, I should gladly receive, if my condition made it necessary; for, to such a mind, who would not be proud to own his obligations? But it has pleased GOD to restore me to so great a measure of health, that if I should now appropriate so much of a fortune destined to do good, I could not escape from myself the charge of advancing a false claim. My journey to the continent, though I once thought it necessary, was never much encouraged by my physicians; and I was very desirous that your Lordship should be told of it by Sir Joshua Reynolds, as an event very uncertain; for if I grew much better, I should not be willing, if much worse, not able, to migrate. Your Lordship was first solicited without my knowledge; but, when I was told that you were pleased to honour me with your patronage, I did not expect to hear of a refusal; yet, as I have had no long time to brood hope, and have not rioted in imaginary opulence, this cold reception has been scarce a disappointment; and, from your Lordship&rsquo;s kindness, I have received a benefit, which only men like you are able to bestow. I shall now live <span class="t8">mihi carior</span>, with a higher opinion of my own merit.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;I am, my Lord,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your Lordship&rsquo;s most obliged,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most grateful, and</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most humble servant,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;September, 1784.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Upon this unexpected failure I abstain from presuming to make any remarks, or to offer any conjectures.</p>
<p class="p24">Having after repeated reasonings, brought Dr. Johnson to agree to my removing to London, and even to furnish me with arguments in favour of what he had opposed; I wrote to him requesting he would write them for me; he was so good as to comply, and I shall extract that part of his letter to me of June 11, as a proof how well he could exhibit a cautious yet encouraging view of it: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I remember, and intreat you to remember, that <span class="t8">virtus est vitium fugere</span>; the first approach to riches is security from poverty. The condition on which you have my consent to settle in London is, that your expence never exceeds your annual income. Fixing this basis of security, you cannot be hurt, and you may be very much advanced. The loss of your Scottish business, which is all that you can lose, is not to be reckoned as any equivalent to the hopes and possibilities that open here upon you. If you succeed, the question of prudence is at an end; every body will think that done right which ends happily; and though your expectations, of which I would not advise you to talk too much, should not be totally answered, you can hardly fail to get friends who will do for you all that your present situation allows you to hope; and if, after a few years, you should return to Scotland, you will return with a mind supplied by various conversation, and many opportunities of enquiry, with much knowledge, and materials for reflection and instruction.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Let us now contemplate Johnson thirty years after the death of his wife, still retaining for her all the tenderness of affection.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;TO THE REVEREND MR. BAGSHAW, AT BROMLEY.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Perhaps you may remember, that in the year 1753, you committed to the ground my dear wife. I now entreat your permission to lay a stone upon her; and have sent the inscription, that, if you find it proper, you may signify your allowance.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;You will do me a great favour by showing the place where she lies, that the stone may protect her remains.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Mr. Ryland will wait on you for the inscription, and procure it to be engraved. You will easily believe that I shrink from this mournful office. When it is done, if I have strength remaining, I will visit Bromley once again, and pay you part of the respect to which you have a right from, Reverend Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your most humble servant,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;July 12, 1784.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On the same day he wrote to Mr. Langton: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I cannot but think that in my languid and anxious state, I have some reason to complain that I receive from you neither enquiry nor consolation. You know how much I value your friendship, and with what confidence I expect your kindness, if I wanted any act of tenderness that you could perform; at least, if you do not know it, I think your ignorance is your own fault. Yet how long is it that I have lived almost in your neighbourhood without the least notice. I do not, however, consider this neglect as particularly shown to me; I hear two of your most valuable friends make the same complaint. But why are all thus overlooked? You are not oppressed by sickness, you are not distracted by business; if you are sick, you are sick of leisure: &mdash; And allow yourself to be told, that no disease is more to be dreaded or avoided. Rather to do nothing than to do good, is the lowest state of a degraded mind. Boileau says to his pupil,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;<span class="t8">Que les vers ne soient pas votre éternel emploi,</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cultivez vos amis</span>1091.&rsquo; &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">That voluntary debility, which modern language is content to term indolence, will, if it is not counteracted by resolution, render in time the strongest faculties lifeless, and turn the flame to the smoke of virtue. I do not expect nor desire to see you, because I am much pleased to find that your mother stays so long with you, and I should think you neither elegant nor grateful, if you did not study her gratification. You will pay my respects to both the ladies, and to all the young people. I am going Northward for a while, to try what help the country can give me; but, if you will write, the letter will come after me.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Next day he set out on a jaunt to Staffordshire and Derbyshire, flattering himself that he might be in some degree relieved.</p>
<p class="p24">During his absence from London he kept up a correspondence with several of his friends, from which I shall select what appears to me proper for publication, without attending nicely to chronological order.</p>
<p class="p24">To Dr. BROCKLESBY, he writes, Ashbourne, July 20: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The kind attention which you have so long shewn to my health and happiness, makes it as much a debt of gratitude as a call of interest, to give you an account of what befals me, when accident recovers me from your immediate care. The journey of the first day was performed with very little sense of fatigue; the second day brought me to Lichfield, without much lassitude; but I am afraid that I could not have borne such violent agitation for many days together. Tell Dr. Heberden, that in the coach I read <span class="t8">Ciceronianus</span> which I concluded as I entered Lichfield. My affection and understanding went along with Erasmus, except that once or twice he somewhat unskilfully entangles Cicero&rsquo;s civil or moral, with his rhetorical, character. I staid five days at Lichfield, but, being unable to walk, had no great pleasure, and yesterday (19th) I came hither, where I am to try what air and attention can perform. Of any improvement in my health I cannot yet please myself with the perception. &mdash; The asthma has no abatement. Opiates stop the fit, so as that I can sit and sometimes lie easy, but they do not now procure me the power of motion; and I am afraid that my general strength of body does not encrease. The weather indeed is not benign; but how low is he sunk whose strength depends upon the weather! I am now looking into Floyer who lived with his asthma to almost his ninetieth year. His book by want of order is obscure, and his asthma, I think, not of the same kind with mine. Something however I may perhaps learn. My appetite still continues keen enough; and what I consider as a symptom of radical health, I have a voracious delight in raw summer fruit, of which I was less eager a few years ago. You will be pleased to communicate this account to Dr. Heberden, and if any thing is to be done, let me have your joint opinion. Now &mdash; <span class="t8">abite curoe</span>; &mdash; let me enquire after the Club.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">July 31. &lsquo;Not recollecting that Dr. Heberden might be at Windsor, I thought your letter long in coming. But, you know, <span class="t8">nocitura petuntur</span>, the letter which I so much desired, tells me that I have lost one of my best and tenderest friends. My comfort is, that he appeared to live like a man that had always before his eyes the fragility of our present existence, and was therefore, I hope, not unprepared to meet his judge. Your attention, dear Sir, and that of Dr. Heberden, to my health, is extremely kind. I am loth to think that I grow worse; and cannot fairly prove even to my own partiality, that I grow much better.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">August 5. &lsquo;I return you thanks, dear Sir, for your unwearied attention, both medicinal and friendly, and hope to prove the effect of your care by living to acknowledge it.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">August 12. &lsquo;Pray be so kind as to have me in your thoughts, and mention my case to others as you have opportunity. I seem to myself neither to gain nor lose strength. I have lately tried milk, but have yet found no advantage, and am afraid of it merely as a liquid. My appetite is still good, which I know is dear Dr. Heberden&rsquo;s criterion of the <span class="t8">vis vitoe</span>. As we cannot now see each other, do not omit to write, for you cannot think with what warmth of expectation I reckon the hours of a post-day.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">August 14. &lsquo;I have hitherto sent you only melancholy letters, you will be glad to hear some better account. Yesterday the asthma remitted, perceptibly remitted, and I moved with more ease than I have enjoyed for many weeks. May GOD continue his mercy. This account I would not delay, because I am not a lover of complaints, or complainers, and yet I have since we parted uttered nothing till now but terrour and sorrow. Write to me, dear Sir.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">August 16. &lsquo;Better I hope, and better. My respiration gets more and more ease and liberty. I went to church yesterday, after a very liberal dinner, without any inconvenience; it is indeed no long walk, but I never walked it without difficulty, since I came, before. &mdash; the intention was only to overpower the seeming <span class="t8">vis inertioe</span> of the pectoral and pulmonary muscles. I am favoured with a degree of ease that very much delights me, and do not despair of another race upon the stairs of the Academy. If I were, however, of a humour to see, or to shew the state of my body, on the dark side, I might say,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="t8">&ldquo;Quid te exempta juvat spinis de pluribus una1101?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p24">The nights are still sleepless, and the water rises, though it does not rise very fast. Let us, however, rejoice in all the good that we have. The remission of one disease will enable nature to combat the rest. The squills I have not neglected; for I have taken more than a hundred drops a day, and one day took two hundred and fifty, which, according to the popular equivalence of a drop to a grain, is more than half an ounce. I thank you, dear Sir, for your attention in ordering the medicines; your attention to me has never failed. If the virtue of medicines could be enforced by the benevolence of the prescriber, how soon should I be well.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">August 19. &lsquo;The relaxation of the asthma still continues, yet I do not trust it wholly to itself, but soothe it now and then with an opiate. I not only perform the perpetual act of respiration with less labour, but I can walk with fewer intervals of rest, and with greater freedom of motion. I never thought well of Dr. James&rsquo;s compounded medicines; his ingredients appeared to me sometimes inefficacious and trifling, and sometimes heterogeneous and destructive of each other. This prescription exhibits a composition of about three hundred and thirty grains, in which there are four grains of emetick tartar, and six drops [of] thebaick tincture. He that writes thus, surely writes for show. The basis of his medicine is the gum ammoniacum, which dear Dr. Lawrence used to give, but of which I never saw any effect. We will, if you please, let this medicine alone. The squills have every suffrage, and in the squills we will rest for the present.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">August 21. &lsquo;The kindness which you shew by having me in your thoughts upon all occasions, will, I hope, always fill my heart with gratitude. Be pleased to return my thanks to Sir George Baker, for the consideration which he has bestowed upon me. Is this the balloon that has been so long expected, this balloon to which I subscribed, but without payment? It is pity that philosophers have been disappointed, and shame that they have been cheated; but I know not well how to prevent either. Of this experiment I have read nothing; where was it exhibited? and who was the man that ran away with so much money? Continue, dear Sir, to write often and more at a time; for none of your prescriptions operate to their proper uses more certainly than your letters operate as cordials.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">August 26. &lsquo;I suffered you to escape last post without a letter, but you are not to expect such indulgence very often; for I write not so much because I have any thing to say, as because I hope for an answer; and the vacancy of my life here makes a letter of great value. I have here little company and little amusement, and thus abandoned to the contemplation of my own miseries, I am sometimes gloomy and depressed; this too I resist as I can, and find opium, I think, useful, but I seldom take more than one grain. Is not this strange weather? Winter absorbed the spring, and now autumn is come before we have had summer. But let not our kindness for each other imitate the inconstancy of the seasons.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Sept. 2. &lsquo;Mr. Windham has been here to see me; he came, I think, forty miles out of his way, and staid about a day and a half, perhaps I make the time shorter than it was. Such conversation I shall not have again till I come back to the regions of literature; and there Windham is, <span class="t8">inter stellas</span> <span class="t8">Luna minores</span>.&rsquo; He then mentions the effects of certain medicines, as taken; that &lsquo;Nature is recovering its original powers, and the functions returning to their proper state. God continue his mercies, and grant me to use them rightly.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Sept. 9. &lsquo;Do you know the Duke and Duchess of Devonshire? And have you ever seen Chatsworth? I was at Chatsworth on Monday: I had indeed seen it before, but never when its owners were at home; I was very kindly received, and honestly pressed to stay: but I told them that a sick man is not a fit inmate of a great house. But I hope to go again some time.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Sept. 11. &lsquo;I think nothing grows worse, but all rather better, except sleep, and that of late has been at its old pranks. Last evening, I felt what I had not known for a long time, an inclination to walk for amusement; I took a short walk, and came back again neither breathless nor fatigued. This has been a gloomy, frigid, ungenial summer, but of late it seems to mend; I hear the heat sometimes mentioned, but I do not feel it:</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Praterea minimus gelido jam in corpore sanguis</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Febre calet solá1108. &mdash; &mdash; &ldquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I hope, however, with good help, to find means of supporting a winter at home, and to hear and tell at the Club what is doing, and what ought to be doing in the world. I have no company here, and shall naturally come home hungry for conversation. To wish you, dear Sir, more leisure, would not be kind; but what leisure you have, you must bestow upon me.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Sept. 16. &lsquo;I have now let you alone for a long time, having indeed little to say. You charge me somewhat unjustly with luxury. At Chatsworth, you should remember, that I have eaten but once; and the Doctor, with whom I live, follows a milk diet. I grow no fatter, though my stomach, if it be not disturbed by physick, never fails me. I now grow weary of solitude, and think of removing next week to Lichfield, a place of more society, but otherwise of less convenience. When I am settled, I shall write again. Of the hot weather that you mention, we have [not] had in Derbyshire very much, and for myself I seldom feel heat, and suppose that my frigidity is the effect of my distemper; a supposition which naturally leads me to hope that a hotter climate may be useful. But I hope to stand another English winter.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Lichfield, Sept. 29. &lsquo;On one day I had three letters about the air-balloon: yours was far the best, and has enabled me to impart to my friends in the country an idea of this species of amusement. In amusement, mere amusement, I am afraid it must end, for I do not find that its course can be directed so as that it should serve any purposes of communication; and it can give no new intelligence of the state of the air at different heights, till they have ascended above the height of mountains, which they seem never likely to do. I came hither on the 27th. How long I shall stay I have not determined. My dropsy is gone, and my asthma much remitted, but I have felt myself a little declining these two days, or at least to-day; but such vicissitudes must be expected. One day may be worse than another; but this last month is far better than the former; if the next should be as much better than this, I shall run about the town on my own legs.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">October 6. &lsquo;The fate of the balloon I do not much lament: to make new balloons, is to repeat the jest again. We now know a method of mounting into the air, and, I think, are not likely to know more. The vehicles can serve no use till we can guide them; and they can gratify no curiosity till we mount with them to greater heights than we can reach without; till we rise above the tops of the highest mountains, which we have yet not done. We know the state of the air in all its regions, to the top of Teneriffe, and therefore, learn nothing from those who navigate a balloon below the clouds. The first experiment, however, was bold, and deserved applause and reward. But since it has been performed, and its event is known, I had rather now find a medicine that can ease an asthma.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">October 25. &lsquo;You write to me with a zeal that animates, and a tenderness that melts me. I am not afraid either of a journey to London, or a residence in it. I came down with little fatigue, and am now not weaker. In the smoky atmosphere I was delivered from the dropsy, which I consider as the original and radical disease. The town is my element; there are my friends, there are my books, to which I have not yet bid farewell, and there are my amusements. Sir Joshua told me long ago that my vocation was to publick life, and I hope still to keep my station, till GOD shall bid me <span class="t8">Go in peace</span>.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">To MR. HOOLE: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">Ashbourne, Aug. 7. &lsquo;Since I was here I have two little letters from you, and have not had the gratitude to write. But every man is most free with his best friends, because he does not suppose that they can suspect him of intentional incivility. One reason for my omission is, that being in a place to which you are wholly a stranger, I have no topicks of correspondence. If you had any knowledge of Ashbourne, I could tell you of two Ashbourne men, who, being last week condemned at Derby to be hanged for a robbery, went and hanged themselves in their cell. But this, however it may supply us with talk, is nothing to you. Your kindness, I know, would make you glad to hear some good of me, but I have not much good to tell; if I grow not worse, it is all that I can say. I hope Mrs. Hoole receives more help from her migration. Make her my compliments, and write again to, dear Sir, your affectionate servant.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Aug. 13. &lsquo;I thank you for your affectionate letter. I hope we shall both be the better for each other&rsquo;s friendship, and I hope we shall not very quickly be parted. Tell Mr. Nicholls that I shall be glad of his correspondence, when his business allows him a little remission; though to wish him less business, that I may have more pleasure, would be too selfish. To pay for seats at the balloon is not very necessary, because in less than a minute, they who gaze at a mile&rsquo;s distance will see all that can be seen. About the wings I am of your mind; they cannot at all assist it, nor I think regulate its motion. I am now grown somewhat easier in my body, but my mind is sometimes depressed. About the Club I am in no great pain. The forfeitures go on, and the house, I hear, is improved for our future meetings. I hope we shall meet often and sit long.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Sept. 4. &lsquo;Your letter was, indeed, long in coming, but it was very welcome. Our acquaintance has now subsisted long and our recollection of each other involves a great space, and many little occurrences, which melt the thoughts to tenderness. Write to me, therefore, as frequently as you can. I hear from Dr. Brocklesby and Mr. Ryland, that the Club is not crouded. I hope we shall enliven it when winter brings us together.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">To DR. BURNEY: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">August 2. &lsquo;The weather, you know, has not been balmy; I am now reduced to think, and am at last content to talk of the weather. Pride must have a fall. I have lost dear Mr. Allen, and wherever I turn, the dead or the dying meet my notice, and force my attention upon misery and mortality. Mrs. Burney&rsquo;s escape from so much danger, and her ease after so much pain, throws, however, some radiance of hope upon the gloomy prospect. May her recovery be perfect, and her continuance long. I struggle hard for life. I take physick, and take air; my friend&rsquo;s chariot is always ready. We have run this morning twenty-four miles, and could run forty-eight more. <span class="t8">But who can run the race with death?</span>&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Sept. 4. [Concerning a private transaction, in which his opinion was asked, and after giving it he makes the following reflections, which are applicable on other occasions.] Nothing deserves more compassion than wrong conduct with good meaning; than loss or obloquy suffered by one who, as he is conscious only of good intentions, wonders why he loses that kindness which he wishes to preserve; and not knowing his own fault, if, as may sometimes happen, nobody will tell him, goes on to offend by his endeavours to please. I am delighted by finding that our opinions are the same. You will do me a real kindness by continuing to write. A post-day has now been long a day of recreation.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Nov. 1. &lsquo;Our correspondence paused for want of topicks. I had said what I had to say on the matter proposed to my consideration; and nothing remained but to tell you, that I waked or slept; that I was more or less sick. I drew my thoughts in upon myself, and supposed yours employed upon your book. That your book has been delayed I am glad, since you have gained an opportunity of being more exact. Of the caution necessary in adjusting narratives there is no end. Some tell what they do not know, that they may not seem ignorant, and others from mere indifference about truth. All truth is not, indeed, of equal importance; but, if little violations are allowed, every violation will in time be thought little; and a writer should keep himself vigilantly on his guard against the first temptations to negligence or supineness. I had ceased to write, because respecting you I had no more to say, and respecting myself could say little good. I cannot boast of advancement, and in cases of convalescence it may be said, with few exceptions, <span class="t8">non progredi, est regredi</span>. I hope I may be excepted. My great difficulty was with my sweet Fanny, who, by her artifice of inserting her letter in yours, had given me a precept of frugality which I was not at liberty to neglect; and I know not who were in town under whose cover I could send my letter. I rejoice to hear that you are all so well, and have a delight particularly sympathetick in the recovery of Mrs. Burney.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">To MR. LANGTON: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">Aug. 25. &lsquo;The kindness of your last letter, and my omission to answer it, begins to give you, even in my opinion, a right to recriminate, and to charge me with forgetfulness for the absent. I will, therefore, delay no longer to give an account of myself, and wish I could relate what would please either myself or my friend. On July 13, I left London, partly in hope of help from new air and change of place, and partly excited by the sick man&rsquo;s impatience of the present. I got to Lichfield in a stage vehicle, with very little fatigue, in two days, and had the consolation to find, that since my last visit my three old acquaintance are all dead. July 20, I went to Ashbourne, where I have been till now; the house in which we live is repairing. I live in too much solitude, and am often deeply dejected: I wish we were nearer, and rejoice in your removal to London. A friend, at once cheerful and serious, is a great acquisition. Let us not neglect one another for the little time which Providence allows us to hope. Of my health I cannot tell you, what my wishes persuaded me to expect, that it is much improved by the season or by remedies. I am sleepless; my legs grow weary with a very few steps, and the water breaks its boundaries in some degree. The asthma, however, has remitted; my breath is still much obstructed, but is more free than it was. Nights of watchfulness produce torpid days; I read very little, though I am alone; for I am tempted to supply in the day what I lost in bed. This is my history; like all other histories, a narrative of misery. Yet am I so much better than in the beginning of the year, that I ought to be ashamed of complaining. I now sit and write with very little sensibility of pain or weakness; but when I rise, I shall find my legs betraying me. Of the money which you mentioned, I have no immediate need; keep it, however, for me, unless some exigence requires it. Your papers I will shew you certainly when you would see them, but I am a little angry at you for not keeping minutes of your own <span class="t8">acceptum et expensum</span>, and think a little time might be spared from Aristophanes, for the <span class="t8">res familiares</span>. Forgive me for I mean well. I hope, dear Sir, that you and Lady Rothes, and all the young people, too many to enumerate, are well and happy. GOD bless you all.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">To MR. WINDHAM: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">August. &lsquo;The tenderness with which you have been pleased to treat me, through my long illness, neither health nor sickness can, I hope, make me forget; and you are not to suppose, that after we parted you were no longer in my mind. But what can a sick man say, but that he is sick? His thoughts are necessarily concentered in himself; he neither receives nor can give delight; his enquiries are after alleviations of pain, and his efforts are to catch some momentary comfort. Though I am now in the neighbourhood of the Peak, you must expect no account of its wonders, of its hills, its waters, its caverns, or its mines; but I will tell you, dear Sir, what I hope you will not hear with less satisfaction, that, for about a week past, my asthma has been less afflictive.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Lichfield. October 2. &lsquo;I believe you have been long enough acquainted with the <span class="t8">phoenomena</span> of sickness, not to be surprised that a sick man wishes to be where he is not, and where it appears to every body but himself that he might easily be, without having the resolution to remove. I thought Ashbourne a solitary place, but did not come hither till last Monday. I have here more company, but my health has for this last week not advanced; and in the languor of disease how little can be done? Whither or when I shall make my next remove I cannot tell; but I entreat you, dear Sir, to let me know, from time to time, where you may be found, for your residence is a very powerful attractive to, Sir, your most humble servant.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To MR. PERKINS. &lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I cannot but flatter myself that your kindness for me will make you glad to know where I am, and in what state.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I have been struggling very hard with my diseases. My breath has been very much obstructed, and the water has attempted to encroach upon me again. I past the first part of the summer at Oxford, afterwards I went to Lichfield, thence to Ashbourne, in Derbyshire, and a week ago I returned to Lichfield.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;My breath is now much easier, and the water is in a great measure run away, so that I hope to see you again before winter.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Please to make my compliments to Mrs. Perkins, and to Mr. and Mrs. Barclay.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am, dear Sir, &lsquo;Your most humble servant, &lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo; &lsquo;Lichfield, Oct. 4, 1784.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To THE RIGHT HON. WILLIAM GERARD HAMILTON. &lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Considering what reason you gave me in the spring to conclude that you took part in whatever good or evil might befal me, I ought not to have omitted so long the account which I am now about to give you. My diseases are an asthma and a dropsy, and, what is less curable, seventy-five. Of the dropsy, in the beginning of the summer, or in the spring, I recovered to a degree which struck with wonder both me and my physicians: the asthma now is likewise, for a time, very much relieved. I went to Oxford, where the asthma was very tyrannical, and the dropsy began again to threaten me; but seasonable physick stopped the inundation: I then returned to London, and in July took a resolution to visit Staffordshire and Derbyshire, where I am yet struggling with my diseases. The dropsy made another attack, and was not easily ejected, but at last gave way. The asthma suddenly remitted in bed, on the 13th of August, and, though now very oppressive, is, I think, still something gentler than it was before the remission. My limbs are miserably debilitated, and my nights are sleepless and tedious. When you read this, dear Sir, you are not sorry that I wrote no sooner. I will not prolong my complaints. I hope still to see you <span class="t8">in a happier hour</span>, to talk over what we have often talked, and perhaps to find new topicks of merriment, or new incitements to curiosity. I am, dear Sir, &amp;c. SAM. JOHNSON. Lichfield, Oct. 20, 1784.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;TO JOHN PARADISE, ESQ.</p>
<p class="p24">DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">Though in all my summer&rsquo;s excursion I have given you no account of myself, I hope you think better of me than to imagine it possible for me to forget you, whose kindness to me has been too great and too constant not to have made its impression on a harder breast than mine. Silence is not very culpable when nothing pleasing is suppressed. It would have alleviated none of your complaints to have read my vicissitudes of evil. I have struggled hard with very formidable and obstinate maladies; and though I cannot talk of health, think all praise due to my Creator and Preserver for the continuance of my life. The dropsy has made two attacks, and has given way to medicine; the asthma is very oppressive, but that has likewise once remitted. I am very weak, and very sleepless; but it is time to conclude the tale of misery. I hope, dear Sir, that you grow better, for you have likewise your share of human evil, and that your lady and the young charmers are well.</p>
<p class="p24">I am, dear Sir, &amp;c. SAM. JOHNSON.</p>
<p class="p24">Lichfield, Oct. 20, 1784.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To Mr. George Nicol.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Dear Sir, &lsquo;Since we parted, I have been much oppressed by my asthma, but it has lately been less laborious. When I sit I am almost at ease, and I can walk, though yet very little, with less difficulty for this week past, than before. I hope I shall again enjoy my friends, and that you and I shall have a little more literary conversation. Where I now am, every thing is very liberally provided for me but conversation. My friend is sick himself, and the reciprocation of complaints and groans affords not much of either pleasure or instruction. What we have not at home this town does not supply, and I shall be glad of a little imported intelligence, and hope that you will bestow, now and then, a little time on the relief and entertainment of, Sir, &lsquo;Yours, &amp;c. &lsquo;Sam. Johnson.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Ashbourne, Aug. 19, 1784.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To Mr. Cruikshank.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Dear Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Do not suppose that I forget you; I hope I shall never be accused of forgetting my benefactors. I had, till lately, nothing to write but complaints upon complaints, of miseries upon miseries; but within this fortnight I have received great relief. Have your Lectures any vacation? If you are released from the necessity of daily study, you may find time for a letter to me. [In this letter he states the particulars of his case.] In return for this account of my health, let me have a good account of yours, and of your prosperity in all your undertakings.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am, dear Sir, yours, &amp;c. &lsquo;Sam. Johnson.&rsquo; &lsquo;Ashbourne, Sept. 4, 1784.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">To Mr. Thomas Davies: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">August 14. &lsquo;The tenderness with which you always treat me, makes me culpable in my own eyes for having omitted to write in so long a separation; I had, indeed, nothing to say that you could wish to hear. All has been hitherto misery accumulated upon misery, disease corroborating disease, till yesterday my asthma was perceptibly and unexpectedly mitigated. I am much comforted with this short relief, and am willing to flatter myself that it may continue and improve. I have at present, such a degree of ease, as not only may admit the comforts, but the duties of life. Make my compliments to Mrs. Davies. Poor dear Allen, he was a good man.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">To SIR JOSHUA REYNOLDS: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">Ashbourne, July 21. &lsquo;The tenderness with which I am treated by my friends, makes it reasonable to suppose that they are desirous to know the state of my health, and a desire so benevolent ought to be gratified. I came to Lichfield in two days without any painful fatigue, and on Monday came hither, where I purpose to stay: and try what air and regularity will effect. I cannot yet persuade myself that I have made much progress in recovery. My sleep is little, my breath is very much encumbered, and my legs are very weak. The water has encreased a little, but has again run off. The most distressing symptom is want of sleep.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">August 19. &lsquo;Having had since our separation, little to say that could please you or myself by saying, I have not been lavish of useless letters; but I flatter myself that you will partake of the pleasure with which I can now tell you that about a week ago, I felt suddenly a sensible remission of my asthma, and consequently a greater lightness of action and motion. Of this grateful alleviation I know not the cause, nor dare depend upon its continuance, but while it lasts I endeavour to enjoy it, and am desirous of communicating, while it lasts, my pleasure to my friends. Hitherto, dear Sir, I had written before the post, which stays in this town but a little while, brought me your letter. Mr. Davies seems to have represented my little tendency to recovery in terms too splendid. I am still restless, still weak, still watery, but the asthma is less oppressive. Poor Ramsay! On which side soever I turn, mortality presents its formidable frown. I left three old friends at Lichfield when I was last there, and now found them all dead. I no sooner lose sight of dear Allen, than I am told that I shall see him no more. That we must all die, we always knew; I wish I had sooner remembered it. Do not think me intrusive or importunate, if I now call, dear Sir, on you to remember it.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Sept. 2. &lsquo;I am glad that a little favour from the court has intercepted your furious purposes. I could not in any case have approved such publick violence of resentment, and should have considered any who encouraged it, as rather seeking sport for themselves, than honour for you. Resentment gratifies him who intended an injury, and pains him unjustly who did not intend it. But all this is now superfluous. I still continue by GOD&rsquo;S mercy to mend. My breath is easier, my nights are quieter, and my legs are less in bulk, and stronger in use. I have, however, yet a great deal to overcome, before I can yet attain even an old man&rsquo;s health. Write, do write to me now and then; we are now old acquaintance, and perhaps few people have lived so much and so long together, with less cause of complaint on either side. The retrospection of this is very pleasant, and I hope we shall never think on each other with less kindness.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Sept. 9. &lsquo;I could not answer your letter before this day, because I went on the sixth to Chatsworth, and did not come back till the post was gone. Many words, I hope, are not necessary between you and me, to convince you what gratitude is excited in my heart, by the Chancellor&rsquo;s liberality and your kind offices. I did not indeed expect that what was asked by the Chancellor would have been refused, but since it has, we will not tell that any thing has been asked. I have enclosed a letter to the Chancellor which, when you have read it, you will be pleased to seal with a head, or other general seal, and convey it to him; had I sent it directly to him, I should have seemed to overlook the favour of your intervention. My last letter told you of my advance in health, which, I think, in the whole still continues. Of the hydropick tumour there is now very little appearance; the asthma is much less troublesome, and seems to remit something day after day. I do not despair of supporting an English winter. At Chatsworth, I met young Mr. Burke, who led me very commodiously into conversation with the Duke and Duchess. We had a very good morning. The dinner was publick.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Sept. 18. &lsquo;I flattered myself that this week would have given me a letter from you, but none has come. Write to me now and then, but direct your next to Lichfield. I think, and I hope, am sure, that I still grow better; I have sometimes good nights; but am still in my legs weak, but so much mended, that I go to Lichfield in hope of being able to pay my visits on foot, for there are no coaches. I have three letters this day, all about the balloon, I could have been content with one. Do not write about the balloon, whatever else you may think proper to say.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">October 2. &lsquo;I am always proud of your approbation, and therefore was much pleased that you liked my letter. When you copied it, you invaded the Chancellor&rsquo;s right rather than mine. The refusal I did not expect, but I had never thought much about it, for I doubted whether the Chancellor had so much tenderness for me as to ask. He, being keeper of the King&rsquo;s conscience, ought not to be supposed capable of an improper petition. All is not gold that glitters, as we have often been told; and the adage is verified in your place and my favour; but if what happens does not make us richer, we must bid it welcome, if it makes us wiser. I do not at present grow better, nor much worse; my hopes, however, are somewhat abated, and a very great loss is the loss of hope, but I struggle on as I can.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">TO MR. JOHN NICHOLS: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">Lichfield, Oct. 20. &lsquo;When you were here, you were pleased, as I am told, to think my absence an inconvenience. I should certainly have been very glad to give so skilful a lover of antiquities any information about my native place, of which, however, I know not much, and have reason to believe that not much is known. Though I have not given you any amusement, I have received amusement from you. At Ashbourne, where I had very little company, I had the luck to borrow <span class="t8">Mr. Bowyer&rsquo;s Life</span>; a book so full of contemporary history, that a literary man must find some of his old friends. I thought that I could, now and then, have told you some hints worth your notice; and perhaps we may talk a life over. I hope we shall be much together; you must now be to me what you were before, and what dear Mr. Allen was, besides. He was taken unexpectedly away, but I think he was a very good man. I have made little progress in recovery. I am very weak, and very sleepless; but I live on and hope.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">This various mass of correspondence, which I have thus brought together, is valuable, both as an addition to the store which the publick already has of Johnson&rsquo;s writings, and as exhibiting a genuine and noble specimen of vigour and vivacity of mind, which neither age nor sickness could impair or diminish.</p>
<p class="p24">It may be observed, that his writing in every way, whether for the publick, or privately to his friends, was by fits and starts; for we see frequently, that many letters are written on the same day. When he had once overcome his aversion to begin, he was, I suppose, desirous to go on, in order to relieve his mind from the uneasy reflection of delaying what he ought to do.</p>
<p class="p24">While in the country, notwithstanding the accumulation of illness which he endured, his mind did not lose its powers. He translated an Ode of Horace, which is printed in his <span class="t8">Works</span>, and composed several prayers. I shall insert one of them, which is so wise and energetick, so philosophical and so pious, that I doubt not of its affording consolation to many a sincere Christian, when in a state of mind to which I believe the best are sometimes liable.</p>
<p class="p24">And here I am enabled fully to refute a very unjust reflection, by Sir John Hawkins, both against Dr. Johnson, and his faithful servant, Mr. Francis Barber; as if both of them had been guilty of culpable neglect towards a person of the name of Heely, whom Sir John chooses to call a <span class="t8">relation</span> of Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s. The fact is, that Mr. Heely was not his relation; he had indeed been married to one of his cousins, but she had died without having children, and he had married another woman; so that even the slight connection which there once had been by <span class="t8">alliance</span> was dissolved. Dr. Johnson, who had shewn very great liberality to this man while his first wife was alive, as has appeared in a former part of this work, was humane and charitable enough to continue his bounty to him occasionally; but surely there was no strong call of duty upon him or upon his legatee, to do more. The following letter, obligingly communicated to me by Mr. Andrew Strahan, will confirm what I have stated: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;TO MR. HEELY, No. 5, IN PYE-STREET, WESTMINSTER.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;As necessity obliges you to call so soon again upon me, you should at least have told the smallest sum that will supply your present want; you cannot suppose that I have much to spare. Two guineas is as much as you ought to be behind with your creditor. If you wait on Mr. Strahan, in New-street, Fetter-lane, or in his absence, on Mr. Andrew Strahan, shew this, by which they are entreated to advance you two guineas, and to keep this as a voucher.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am, Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your humble servant,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Ashbourne, Aug. 12, 1784.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Indeed it is very necessary to keep in mind that Sir John Hawkins has unaccountably viewed Johnson&rsquo;s character and conduct in almost every particular, with an unhappy prejudice.</p>
<p class="p24">We now behold Johnson for the last time, in his native city, for which he ever retained a warm affection, and which, by a sudden apostrophe, under the word <span class="t8">Lich</span>, he introduces with reverence, into his immortal Work, THE ENGLISH DICTIONARY: &mdash; <span class="t8">Salve, magna parens! While here, he felt a revival of all the tenderness of filial affection, an instance of which appeared in his ordering the grave-stone and inscription over Elizabeth Blaney to be substantially and carefully renewed.</span></p>
<p class="p24">To Mr. Henry White, a young clergyman, with whom he now formed an intimacy, so as to talk to him with great freedom, he mentioned that he could not in general accuse himself of having been an undutiful son. &lsquo;Once, indeed, (said he,) I was disobedient; I refused to attend my father to Uttoxeter-market. Pride was the source of that refusal, and the remembrance of it was painful. A few years ago, I desired to atone for this fault; I went to Uttoxeter in very bad weather, and stood for a considerable time bareheaded in the rain, on the spot where my father&rsquo;s stall used to stand. In contrition I stood, and I hope the penance was expiatory.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I told him (says Miss Seward) in one of my latest visits to him, of a wonderful learned pig, which I had seen at Nottingham; and which did all that we have observed exhibited by dogs and horses. The subject amused him. &lsquo;Then, (said he,) the pigs are a race unjustly calumniated. Pig <span class="t8">has, it seems, not been wanting to</span> man<span class="t8">, but</span> man <span class="t8">to</span> pig<span class="t8">. We do not allow</span> time <span class="t8">for his education, we kill him at a year old.&rsquo; Mr. Henry White, who was present, observed that if this instance had happened in or before Pope&rsquo;s time, he would not have been justified in instancing the swine as the lowest degree of groveling instinct. Dr. Johnson seemed pleased with the observation, while the person who made it proceeded to remark, that great torture must have been employed, ere the indocility of the animal could have been subdued. &lsquo;Certainly, (said the Doctor;) but, (turning to me,) how old is your pig?&rsquo; I told him, three years old. &lsquo;Then, (said he,) the pig has no cause to complain; he would have been killed the first year if he had not been</span> educated<span class="t8">, and protracted existence is a good recompence for very considerable degrees of torture.&rsquo;</span></p>
<p class="p24">As Johnson had now very faint hopes of recovery, and as Mrs. Thrale was no longer devoted to him, it might have been supposed that he would naturally have chosen to remain in the comfortable house of his beloved wife&rsquo;s daughter, and end his life where he began it. But there was in him an animated and lofty spirit, and however complicated diseases might depress ordinary mortals, all who saw him, beheld and acknowledged the invictum animum Catonis<span class="t8">. Such was his intellectual ardour even at this time, that he said to one friend, &lsquo;Sir, I look upon every day to be lost, in which I do not make a new acquaintance;&rsquo; and to another, when talking of his illness, &lsquo;I will be conquered; I will not capitulate.&rsquo; And such was his love of London, so high a relish had he of its magnificent extent, and variety of intellectual entertainment, that he languished when absent from it, his mind having become quite luxurious from the long habit of enjoying the metropolis; and, therefore, although at Lichfield, surrounded with friends, who loved and revered him, and for whom he had a very sincere affection, he still found that such conversation as London affords, could be found no where else. These feelings, joined, probably, to some flattering hopes of aid from the eminent physicians and surgeons in London, who kindly and generously attended him without accepting fees, made him resolve to return to the capital. From Lichfield he came to Birmingham, where he passed a few days with his worthy old schoolfellow, Mr. Hector, who thus writes to me: &mdash; </span></p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;He was very solicitous with me to recollect some of our most early transactions, and transmit them to him, for I perceive nothing gave him greater pleasure than calling to mind those days of our innocence. I complied with his request, and he only received them a few days before his death. I have transcribed for your inspection, exactly the minutes I wrote to him.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">This paper having been found in his repositories after his death, Sir John Hawkins has inserted it entire, and I have made occasional use of it and other communications from Mr. Hector, in the course of this Work. I have both visited and corresponded with him since Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s death, and by my inquiries concerning a great variety of particulars have obtained additional information. I followed the same mode with the Reverend Dr. Taylor, in whose presence I wrote down a good deal of what he could tell; and he, at my request, signed his name, to give it authenticity. It is very rare to find any person who is able to give a distinct account of the life even of one whom he has known intimately, without questions being put to them. My friend Dr. Kippis has told me, that on this account it is a practice with him to draw out a biographical catechism.</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson then proceeded to Oxford, where he was again kindly received by Dr. Adams, who was pleased to give me the following account in one of his letters, (Feb. 17th, 1785): &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;His last visit was, I believe, to my house, which he left, after a stay of four or five days. We had much serious talk together, for which I ought to be the better as long as I live. You will remember some discourse which we had in the summer upon the subject of prayer, and the difficulty of this sort of composition. He reminded me of this, and of my having wished him to try his hand, and to give us a specimen of the style and manner that he approved. He added, that he was now in a right frame of mind, and as he could not possibly employ his time better, he would in earnest set about it. But I find upon enquiry, that no papers of this sort were left behind him, except a few short ejaculatory forms suitable to his present situation.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Dr. Adams had not then received accurate information on this subject; for it has since appeared that various prayers had been composed by him at different periods, which, intermingled with pious resolutions, and some short notes of his life, were entitled by him Prayers and Meditations<span class="t8">, and have, in pursuance of his earnest requisition, in the hopes of doing good, been published, with a judicious well-written Preface, by the Reverend Mr. Strahan, to whom he delivered them. This admirable collection, to which I have frequently referred in the course of this Work, evinces, beyond all his compositions for the publick, and all the eulogies of his friends and admirers, the sincere virtue and piety of Johnson. It proves with unquestionable authenticity, that amidst all his constitutional infirmities, his earnestness to conform his practice to the precepts of Christianity was unceasing, and that he habitually endeavoured to refer every transaction of his life to the will of the Supreme Being.</span></p>
<p class="p24">He arrived in London on the 16th of November, and next day sent to Dr. Burney the following note, which I insert as the last token of his remembrance of that ingenious and amiable man, and as another of the many proofs of the tenderness and benignity of his heart: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;MR. JOHNSON, who came home last night, sends his respects to dear Dr. Burney, and all the dear Burneys, little and great.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;TO MR. HECTOR, IN BIRMINGHAM.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I did not reach Oxford until Friday morning, and then I sent Francis to see the balloon fly, but could not go myself. I staid at Oxford till Tuesday, and then came in the common vehicle easily to London. I am as I was, and having seen Dr. Brocklesby, am to ply the squills; but, whatever be their efficacy, this world must soon pass away. Let us think seriously on our duty. I send my kindest respects to dear Mrs. Careless: let me have the prayers of both. We have all lived long, and must soon part. GOD have mercy on us, for the sake of our Lord JESUS CHRIST. Amen.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am, &amp;c.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;London, Nov. 17, 1784.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">His correspondence with me, after his letter on the subject of my settling in London, shall now, so far as is proper, be produced in one series: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">July 26, he wrote to me from Ashbourne: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;On the 14th I came to Lichfield, and found every body glad enough to see me. On the 20th, I came hither, and found a house half-built, of very uncomfortable appearance; but my own room has not been altered. That a man worn with diseases, in his seventy-second or third year, should condemn part of his remaining life to pass among ruins and rubbish, and that no inconsiderable part, appears to me very strange. I know that your kindness makes you impatient to know the state of my health, in which I cannot boast of much improvement. I came through the journey without much inconvenience, but when I attempt self-motion I find my legs weak, and my breath very short; this day I have been much disordered. I have no company; the Doctor is busy in his fields, and goes to bed at nine, and his whole system is so different from mine, that we seem formed for different elements; I have, therefore, all my amusement to seek within myself.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Having written to him, in bad spirits, a letter filled with dejection and fretfulness, and at the same time expressing anxious apprehensions concerning him, on account of a dream which had disturbed me; his answer was chiefly in terms of reproach, for a supposed charge of &lsquo;affecting discontent, and indulging the vanity of complaint.&rsquo; It, however, proceeded, &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Write to me often, and write like a man. I consider your fidelity and tenderness as a great part of the comforts which are yet left me, and sincerely wish we could be nearer to each other.... My dear friend, life is very short and very uncertain; let us spend it as well as we can. My worthy neighbour, Allen, is dead. Love me as well as you can. Pay my respects to dear Mrs. Boswell. Nothing ailed me at that time; let your superstition at last have an end.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Feeling very soon, that the manner in which he had written might hurt me, he two days afterwards, July 28, wrote to me again, giving me an account of his sufferings; after which, he thus proceeds: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Before this letter, you will have had one which I hope you will not take amiss; for it contains only truth, and that truth kindly intended.... Spartam quam nactus es orna<span class="t8">; make the most and best of your lot, and compare yourself not with the few that are above you, but with the multitudes which are below you.... Go steadily forward with lawful business or honest diversions.</span> Be <span class="t8">(as Temple says of the Dutchmen)</span> well when you are not ill, and pleased when you are not angry<span class="t8">.... This may seem but an ill return for your tenderness; but I mean it well, for I love you with great ardour and sincerity. Pay my respects to dear Mrs. Boswell, and teach the young ones to love me.&rsquo;</span></p>
<p class="p24">I unfortunately was so much indisposed during a considerable part of the year, that it was not, or at least I thought it was not in my power to write to my illustrious friend as formerly, or without expressing such complaints as offended him. Having conjured him not to do me the injustice of charging me with affectation, I was with much regret long silent. His last letter to me then came, and affected me very tenderly: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;TO JAMES BOSWELL, ESQ.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I have this summer sometimes amended, and sometimes relapsed, but, upon the whole, have lost ground, very much. My legs are extremely weak, and my breath very short, and the water is now encreasing upon me. In this uncomfortable state your letters used to relieve; what is the reason that I have them no longer? Are you sick, or are you sullen? Whatever be the reason, if it be less than necessity, drive it away; and of the short life that we have, make the best use for yourself and for your friends.... I am sometimes afraid that your omission to write has some real cause, and shall be glad to know that you are not sick, and that nothing ill has befallen dear Mrs. Boswell, or any of your family.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am, Sir, your, &amp;c.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Lichfield, Nov. 5, 1784.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Yet it was not a little painful to me to find, that in a paragraph of this letter, which I have omitted, he still persevered in arraigning me as before, which was strange in him who had so much experience of what I suffered. I, however, wrote to him two as kind letters as I could; the last of which came too late to be read by him, for his illness encreased more rapidly upon him than I had apprehended; but I had the consolation of being informed that he spoke of me on his death-bed, with affection, and I look forward with humble hope of renewing our friendship in a better world.</p>
<p class="p24">I now relieve the readers of this Work from any farther personal notice of its authour, who if he should be thought to have obtruded himself too much upon their attention, requests them to consider the peculiar plan of his biographical undertaking.</p>
<p class="p24">Soon after Johnson&rsquo;s return to the metropolis, both the asthma and dropsy became more violent and distressful. He had for some time kept a journal in Latin of the state of his illness, and the remedies which he used, under the title of Aegri Ephemeris<span class="t8">, which he began on the 6th of July, but continued it no longer than the 8th of November; finding, I suppose, that it was a mournful and unavailing register. It is in my possession; and is written with great care and accuracy.</span></p>
<p class="p24">Still his love of literature did not fail. A very few days before his death he transmitted to his friend Mr. John Nichols, a list of the authours of the Universal History<span class="t8">, mentioning their several shares in that work. It has, according to his direction, been deposited in the British Museum, and is printed in the</span> Gentleman&rsquo;s Magazine <span class="t8">for December, 1784.</span></p>
<p class="p24">During his sleepless nights he amused himself by translating into Latin verse, from the Greek, many of the epigrams in the Anthologica. These translations, with some other poems by him in Latin, he gave to his friend Mr. Langton, who, having added a few notes, sold them to the booksellers for a small sum, to be given to some of Johnson&rsquo;s relations, which was accordingly done; and they are printed in the collection of his works.</p>
<p class="p24">A very erroneous notion has circulated as to Johnson&rsquo;s deficiency in the knowledge of the Greek language, partly owing to the modesty with which, from knowing how much there was to be learnt, he used to mention his own comparative acquisitions. When Mr. Cumberland talked to him of the Greek fragments which are so well illustrated in The Observer, and of the Greek dramatists in general, he candidly acknowledged his insufficiency in that particular branch of Greek literature. Yet it may be said, that though not a great, he was a good Greek scholar. Dr. Charles Burney, the younger, who is universally acknowledged by the best judges to be one of the few men of this age who are very eminent for their skill in that noble language, has assured me, that Johnson could give a Greek word for almost every English one; and that although not sufficiently conversant in the niceties of the language, he upon some occasions discovered, even in these, a considerable degree of critical acumen. Mr. Dalzel, Professor of Greek at Edinburgh, whose skill in it is unquestionable, mentioned to me, in very liberal terms, the impression which was made upon him by Johnson, in a conversation which they had in London concerning that language. As Johnson, therefore, was undoubtedly one of the first Latin scholars in modern times, let us not deny to his fame some additional splendour from Greek.</p>
<p class="p24">I shall now fulfil my promise of exhibiting specimens of various sorts of imitation of Johnson&rsquo;s style.</p>
<p class="p24">In the Transactions of the Royal Irish Academy<span class="t8">, 1787, there is an &lsquo;Essay on the Style of Dr. Samuel Johnson,&rsquo; by the Reverend Robert Burrowes, whose respect for the great object of his criticism is thus evinced in the concluding paragraph: &mdash; </span></p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I have singled him out from the whole body of English writers, because his universally-acknowledged beauties would be most apt to induce imitation; and I have treated rather on his faults than his perfections, because an essay might comprize all the observations I could make upon his faults, while volumes would not be sufficient for a treatise on his perfections.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Mr. BURROWES has analysed the composition of Johnson, and pointed out its peculiarities with much acuteness; and I would recommend a careful perusal of his Essay to those, who being captivated by the union of perspicuity and splendour which the writings of Johnson contain, without having a sufficient portion of his vigour of mind, may be in danger of becoming bad copyists of his manner. I, however, cannot but observe, and I observe it to his credit, that this learned gentleman has himself caught no mean degree of the expansion and harmony, which, independent of all other circumstances, characterise the sentences of Johnson. Thus, in the Preface to the volume in which his Essay appears, we find, &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;If it be said that in societies of this sort, too much attention is frequently bestowed on subjects barren and speculative, it may be answered, that no one science is so little connected with the rest, as not to afford many principles whose use may extend considerably beyond the science to which they primarily belong; and that no proposition is so purely theoretical as to be totally incapable of being applied to practical purposes. There is no apparent connection between duration and the cycloidal arch, the properties of which duly attended to, have furnished us with our best regulated methods of measuring time: and he who has made himself master of the nature and affections of the logarithmick curve, is not aware that he has advanced considerably towards ascertaining the proportionable density of the air at its various distances from the surface of the earth.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">The ludicrous imitators of Johnson&rsquo;s style are innumerable. Their general method is to accumulate hard words, without considering, that, although he was fond of introducing them occasionally, there is not a single sentence in all his writings where they are crowded together, as in the first verse of the following imaginary Ode by him to Mrs. Thrale, which appeared in the newspapers: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Cervisial coctor&rsquo;s viduate <span class="t8">dame,</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Opin&rsquo;st <span class="t8">thou this gigantick frame,</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Procumbing <span class="t8">at thy shrine:</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall,</span> catenated <span class="t8">by thy charms,</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A captive in thy</span> ambient <span class="t8">arms,</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Perennially<span class="t8"> be thine?&rsquo;</span></p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p24">This, and a thousand other such attempts, are totally unlike the original, which the writers imagined they were turning into ridicule. There is not similarity enough for burlesque, or even for caricature.</p>
<p class="p24">Mr. COLMAN, in his Prose on several occasions<span class="t8">, has</span> A Letter from LEXIPHANES; containing Proposals for a Glossary or Vocabulary of the Vulgar Tongue: intended as a Supplement to a larger DICTIONARY<span class="t8">. It is evidently meant as a sportive sally of ridicule on Johnson, whose style is thus imitated, without being grossly overcharged: &mdash; </span></p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;It is easy to foresee, that the idle and illiterate will complain that I have increased their labours by endeavouring to diminish them; and that I have explained what is more easy by what is more difficult &mdash; ignotum per ignotius<span class="t8">. I expect, on the other hand, the liberal acknowledgements of the learned. He who is buried in scholastick retirement, secluded from the assemblies of the gay, and remote from the circles of the polite, will at once comprehend the definitions, and be grateful for such a seasonable and necessary elucidation of his mother-tongue.&rsquo;</span></p>
<p class="p24">Annexed to this letter is a short specimen of the work, thrown together</p>
<p class="p24">in a vague and desultory manner, not even adhering to alphabetical concatenation.</p>
<p class="p24">The serious imitators of Johnson&rsquo;s style, whether intentionally or by the imperceptible effect of its strength and animation, are, as I have had already occasion to observe, so many, that I might introduce quotations from a numerous body of writers in our language, since he appeared in the literary world. I shall point out only the following: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">WILLIAM ROBERTSON, D.D.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;In other parts of the globe, man, in his rudest state, appears as lord of the creation, giving law to various tribes of animals which he has tamed and reduced to subjection. The Tartar follows his prey on the horse which he has reared, or tends his numerous herds, which furnish him both with food and clothing; the Arab has rendered the camel docile, and avails himself of its persevering strength; the Laplander has formed the rein-deer to be subservient to his will; and even the people of Kamschatka have trained their dogs to labour. This command over the inferiour creatures is one of the noblest prerogatives of man, and among the greatest efforts of his wisdom and power. Without this, his dominion is incomplete. He is a monarch who has no subjects; a master without servants; and must perform every operation by the strength of his own arm.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">EDWARD GIBBON, Esq.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Of all our passions and appetites, the love of power is of the most imperious and unsociable nature, since the pride of one man requires the submission of the multitude. In the tumult of civil discord the laws of society lose their force, and their place is seldom supplied by those of humanity. The ardour of contention, the pride of victory, the despair of success, the memory of past injuries, and the fear of future dangers, all contribute to inflame the mind, and to silence the voice of pity.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">MISS BURNEY.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;My family, mistaking ambition for honour, and rank for dignity, have long planned a splendid connection for me, to which, though my invariable repugnance has stopped any advances, their wishes and their views immovably adhere. I am but too certain they will now listen to no other. I dread, therefore, to make a trial where I despair of success; I know not how to risk a prayer with those who may silence me by a command.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">REVEREND MR. NARES.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;In an enlightened and improving age, much perhaps is not to be apprehended from the inroads of mere caprice; at such a period it will generally be perceived, that needless irregularity is the worst of all deformities, and that nothing is so truly elegant in language as the simplicity of unviolated analogy. Rules will, therefore, be observed, so far as they are known and acknowledged: but, at the same time, the desire of improvement having been once excited will not remain inactive; and its efforts, unless assisted by knowledge, as much as they are prompted by zeal, will not unfrequently be found pernicious; so that the very persons whose intention it is to perfect the instrument of reason, will deprave and disorder it unknowingly. At such a time, then, it becomes peculiarly necessary that the analogy of language should be fully examined and understood; that its rules should be carefully laid down; and that it should be clearly known how much it contains, which being already right should be defended from change and violation: how much it has that demands amendment; and how much that, for fear of greater inconveniencies, must, perhaps, be left unaltered, though irregular.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">A distinguished authour in The Mirror<span class="t8">, a periodical paper, published at Edinburgh, has imitated Johnson very closely. Thus, in No. 16, &mdash; </span></p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The effects of the return of spring have been frequently remarked as well in relation to the human mind as to the animal and vegetable world. The reviving power of this season has been traced from the fields to the herds that inhabit them, and from the lower classes of beings up to man. Gladness and joy are described as prevailing through universal Nature, animating the low of the cattle, the carol of the birds, and the pipe of the shepherd.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">The Reverend Dr. KNOX, master of Tunbridge school, appears to have the imitari avco<span class="t8"> of Johnson&rsquo;s style perpetually in his mind; and to his assiduous, though not servile, study of it, we may partly ascribe the extensive popularity of his writings.</span></p>
<p class="p24">In his Essays, Moral and Literary<span class="t8">, No. 3, we find the following passage: &mdash; </span></p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The polish of external grace may indeed be deferred till the approach of manhood. When solidity is obtained by pursuing the modes prescribed by our fore-fathers, then may the file be used. The firm substance will bear attrition, and the lustre then acquired will be durable.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">There is, however, one in No. 11, which is blown up into such tumidity, as to be truly ludicrous. The writer means to tell us, that Members of Parliament, who have run in debt by extravagance, will sell their votes to avoid an arrest, which he thus expresses: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;They who build houses and collect costly pictures and furniture with the money of an honest artisan or mechanick, will be very glad of emancipation from the hands of a bailiff, by a sale of their senatorial suffrage.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">But I think the most perfect imitation of Johnson is a professed one, entitled A Criticism on Gray&rsquo;s Elegy in a Country Church-Yard<span class="t8">, said to be written by Mr. Young, Professor of Greek, at Glasgow, and of which let him have the credit, unless a better title can be shewn. It has not only the peculiarities of Johnson&rsquo;s style, but that very species of literary discussion and illustration for which he was eminent. Having already quoted so much from others, I shall refer the curious to this performance, with an assurance of much entertainment.</span></p>
<p class="p24">Yet whatever merit there may be in any imitations of Johnson&rsquo;s style, every good judge must see that they are obviously different from the original; for all of them are either deficient in its force, or overloaded with its peculiarities; and the powerful sentiment to which it is suited is not to be found.</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson&rsquo;s affection for his departed relations seemed to grow warmer as he approached nearer to the time when he might hope to see them again. It probably appeared to him that he should upbraid himself with unkind inattention, were he to leave the world without having paid a tribute of respect to their memory.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To MR. GREEN, APOTHECARY, AT LICHFIELD.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I have enclosed the Epitaph for my Father, Mother, and Brother, to be all engraved on the large size, and laid in the middle aisle in St. Michael&rsquo;s church, which I request the clergyman and churchwardens to permit.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The first care must be to find the exact place of interment, that the stone may protect the bodies. Then let the stone be deep, massy, and hard; and do not let the difference of ten pounds, or more, defeat our purpose.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I have enclosed ten pounds, and Mrs. Porter will pay you ten more, which I gave her for the same purpose. What more is wanted shall be sent; and I beg that all possible haste may be made, for I wish to have it done while I am yet alive. Let me know, dear Sir, that you receive this.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am, Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your most humble servant,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Dec. 2, 1784.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To MRS. LUCY PORTER, IN LICHFIELD.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;DEAR MADAM,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am very ill, and desire your prayers. I have sent Mr. Green the Epitaph, and a power to call on you for ten pounds.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I laid this summer a stone over Tetty, in the chapel of Bromley, in Kent. The inscription is in Latin, of which this is the English. [Here a translation.]</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;That this is done, I thought it fit that you should know. What care will be taken of us, who can tell? May GOD pardon and bless us, for JESUS CHRIST&rsquo;S sake.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am, &amp;c.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON,&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Dec. 2, 1784.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">My readers are now, at last, to behold SAMUEL JOHNSON preparing himself for that doom, from which the most exalted powers afford no exemption to man. Death had always been to him an object of terrour; so that, though by no means happy, he still clung to life with an eagerness at which many have wondered. At any time when he was ill, he was very much pleased to be told that he looked better. An ingenious member of the Eumelian Club<span class="t8">, informs me, that upon one occasion when he said to him that he saw health returning to his cheek, Johnson seized him by the hand and exclaimed, &lsquo;Sir, you are one of the kindest friends I ever had.&rsquo;</span></p>
<p class="p24">His own state of his views of futurity will appear truly rational; and may, perhaps, impress the unthinking with seriousness.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;You know, (says he,) I never thought confidence with respect to futurity, any part of the character of a brave, a wise, or a good man. Bravery has no place where it can avail nothing; wisdom impresses strongly the consciousness of those faults, of which it is, perhaps, itself an aggravation; and goodness, always wishing to be better, and imputing every deficience to criminal negligence, and every fault to voluntary corruption, never dares to suppose the condition of forgiveness fulfilled, nor what is wanting in the crime supplied by penitence.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;This is the state of the best; but what must be the condition of him whose heart will not suffer him to rank himself among the best, or among the good? Such must be his dread of the approaching trial, as will leave him little attention to the opinion of those whom he is leaving for ever; and the serenity that is not felt, it can be no virtue to feign.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">His great fear of death, and the strange dark manner in which Sir John Hawkins imparts the uneasiness which he expressed on account of offences with which he charged himself, may give occasion to injurious suspicions, as if there had been something of more than ordinary criminality weighing upon his conscience. On that account, therefore, as well as from the regard to truth which he inculcated, I am to mention, (with all possible respect and delicacy, however,) that his conduct, after he came to London, and had associated with Savage and others, was not so strictly virtuous, in one respect, as when he was a younger man. It was well known, that his amorous inclinations were uncommonly strong and impetuous. He owned to many of his friends, that he used to take women of the town to taverns, and hear them relate their history. In short, it must not be concealed, that, like many other good and pious men, among whom we may place the Apostle Paul upon his own authority, Johnson was not free from propensities which were ever &lsquo;warring against the law of his mind,&rsquo; &mdash; and that in his combats with them, he was sometimes overcome.</p>
<p class="p24">Here let the profane and licentious pause; let them not thoughtlessly say that Johnson was an hypocrite<span class="t8">, or that his</span> principles <span class="t8">were not firm, because his</span> practice <span class="t8">was not uniformly conformable to what he professed.</span></p>
<p class="p24">Let the question be considered independent of moral and religious association; and no man will deny that thousands, in many instances, act against conviction. Is a prodigal, for example, an hypocrite<span class="t8">, when he owns he is satisfied that his extravagance will bring him to ruin and misery? We are</span> sure <span class="t8">he</span> believes <span class="t8">it; but immediate inclination, strengthened by indulgence, prevails over that belief in influencing his conduct. Why then shall credit be refused to the</span> sincerity <span class="t8">of those who acknowledge their persuasion of moral and religious duty, yet sometimes fail of living as it requires? I heard Dr. Johnson once observe, &lsquo;There is something noble in publishing truth, though it condemns one&rsquo;s self.&rsquo; And one who said in his presence, &lsquo;he had no notion of people being in earnest in their good professions, whose practice was not suitable to them,&rsquo; was thus reprimanded by him:&mdash; &lsquo;Sir, are you so grossly ignorant of human nature as not to know that a man may be very sincere in good principles, without having good practice?&rsquo;</span></p>
<p class="p24">But let no man encourage or soothe himself in &lsquo;presumptuous sin,&rsquo; from knowing that Johnson was sometimes hurried into indulgences which he thought criminal. I have exhibited this circumstance as a shade in so great a character, both from my sacred love of truth, and to shew that he was not so weakly scrupulous as he has been represented by those who imagine that the sins, of which a deep sense was upon his mind, were merely such little venial trifles as pouring milk into his tea on Good-Friday. His understanding will be defended by my statement, if his consistency of conduct be in some degree impaired. But what wise man would, for momentary gratifications, deliberately subject himself to suffer such uneasiness as we find was experienced by Johnson in reviewing his conduct as compared with his notion of the ethicks of the gospel? Let the following passages be kept in remembrance: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;O, GOD, giver and preserver of all life, by whose power I was created, and by whose providence I am sustained, look down upon me with tenderness and mercy; grant that I may not have been created to be finally destroyed; that I may not be preserved to add wickedness to wickedness.&rsquo; &lsquo;O, LORD, let me not sink into total depravity; look down upon me, and rescue me at last from the captivity of sin.&rsquo; &lsquo;Almighty and most merciful Father, who hast continued my life from year to year, grant that by longer life I may become less desirous of sinful pleasures, and more careful of eternal happiness.&rsquo; &lsquo;Let not my years be multiplied to increase my guilt; but as my age advances, let me become more pure in my thoughts, more regular in my desires, and more obedient to thy laws.&rsquo; &lsquo;Forgive, O merciful LORD, whatever I have done contrary to thy laws. Give me such a sense of my wickedness as may produce true contrition and effectual repentance; so that when I shall be called into another state, I may be received among the sinners to whom whom sorrow and reformation have obtained pardon, for JESUS CHRIST&rsquo;S sake. Amen.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Such was the distress of mind, such the penitence of Johnson, in his hours of privacy, and in his devout approaches to his Maker. His sincerity<span class="t8">, therefore, must appear to every candid mind unquestionable.</span></p>
<p class="p24">It is of essential consequence to keep in view, that there was in this excellent man&rsquo;s conduct no false principle of commutation<span class="t8">, no</span> deliberate <span class="t8">indulgence in sin, in consideration of a counter-balance of duty. His offending, and his repenting, were distinct and separate: and when we consider his almost unexampled attention to truth, his inflexible integrity, his constant piety, who will dare to &lsquo;cast a stone at him?&rsquo; Besides, let it never be forgotten, that he cannot be charged with any offence indicating badness of</span> heart<span class="t8">, any thing dishonest, base, or malignant; but that, on the contrary, he was charitable in an extraordinary degree: so that even in one of his own rigid judgements of himself, (Easter-eve, 1781,) while he says, &lsquo;I have corrected no external habits;&rsquo; he is obliged to own, &lsquo;I hope that since my last communion I have advanced, by pious reflections, in my submission to GOD, and my benevolence to man.&rsquo;</span></p>
<p class="p24">I am conscious that this is the most difficult and dangerous part of my biographical work, and I cannot but be very anxious concerning it. I trust that I have got through it, preserving at once my regard to truth, &mdash; to my friend, &mdash; and to the interests of virtue and religion. Nor can I apprehend that more harm can ensue from the knowledge of the irregularity of Johnson, guarded as I have stated it, than from knowing that Addison and Parnell were intemperate in the use of wine; which he himself, in his Lives <span class="t8">of those celebrated writers and pious men, has not forborne to record.</span></p>
<p class="p24">It is not my intention to give a very minute detail of the particulars of Johnson&rsquo;s remaining days, of whom it was now evident, that the crisis was fast approaching, when he must &lsquo;die like men, and fall like one of the Princes<span class="t8">.&rsquo; Yet it will be instructive, as well as gratifying to the curiosity of my readers, to record a few circumstances, on the authenticity of which they may perfectly rely, as I have been at the utmost pains to obtain an accurate account of his last illness, from the best authority.</span></p>
<p class="p24">Dr. Heberden, Dr. Brocklesby, Dr. Warren, and Dr. Butter, physicians, generously attended him, without accepting any fees, as did Mr. Cruikshank, surgeon; and all that could be done from professional skill and ability, was tried, to prolong a life so truly valuable. He himself, indeed, having, on account of his very bad constitution, been perpetually applying himself to medical inquiries, united his own efforts with those of the gentlemen who attended him; and imagining that the dropsical collection of water which oppressed him might be drawn off by making incisions in his body, he, with his usual resolute defiance of pain, cut deep, when he thought that his surgeon had done it too tenderly.</p>
<p class="p24">About eight or ten days before his death, when Dr. Brocklesby paid him his morning visit, he seemed very low and desponding, and said, &lsquo;I have been as a dying man all night.&rsquo; He then emphatically broke out in the words of Shakspeare, &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Can&rsquo;st thou not minister to a mind diseas&rsquo;d;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pluck from the memory a rooted sorrow;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raze out the written troubles of the brain;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, with some sweet oblivious antidote,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cleanse the stuff&rsquo;d bosom of that perilous stuff,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which weighs upon the heart?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">To which Dr. Brocklesby readily answered, from the same great poet: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo; &mdash;&mdash;&nbsp; &mdash;&mdash;&nbsp; &mdash;&mdash;&nbsp; &mdash;&mdash; therein the patient</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Must minister to himself1226.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson expressed himself much satisfied with the application.</p>
<p class="p24">On another day after this, when talking on the subject of prayer, Dr. Brocklesby repeated from Juvenal, &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Orandum est, ut sit mens sana in corpore Sano<span class="t8">1227,&rsquo;</span></p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p24">and so on to the end of the tenth satire; but in running it quickly over, he happened, in the line,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Qui spatium vitae; extremum inter munera ponat<span class="t8">,&rsquo;</span></p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p24">to pronounce supremum <span class="t8">for</span> extremum<span class="t8">; at which Johnson&rsquo;s critical ear instantly took offence, and discoursing vehemently on the unmetrical effect of such a lapse, he shewed himself as full as ever of the spirit of the grammarian.</span></p>
<p class="p24">Having no near relations, it had been for some time Johnson&rsquo;s intention to make a liberal provision for his faithful servant, Mr. Francis Barber, whom he looked upon as particularly under his protection, and whom he had all along treated truly as an humble friend. Having asked Dr. Brocklesby what would be a proper annuity to a favourite servant, and being answered that it must depend on the circumstances of the master; and, that in the case of a nobleman, fifty pounds a year was considered as an adequate reward for many years&rsquo; faithful service; &lsquo;Then, (said Johnson,) shall I be nobilissimus<span class="t8">, for I mean to leave Frank seventy pounds a year, and I desire you to tell him so.&rsquo; It is strange, however, to think, that Johnson was not free from that general weakness of being averse to execute a will, so that he delayed it from time to time; and had it not been for Sir John Hawkins&rsquo;s repeatedly urging it, I think it is probable that his kind resolution would not have been fulfilled. After making one, which, as Sir John Hawkins informs us, extended no further than the promised annuity, Johnson&rsquo;s final disposition of his property was established by a Will and Codicil, of which copies are subjoined.</span></p>
<p class="p24">The consideration of numerous papers of which he was possessed, seems to have struck Johnson&rsquo;s mind, with a sudden anxiety, and as they were in great confusion, it is much to be lamented that he had not entrusted some faithful and discreet person with the care and selection of them; instead of which, he in a precipitate manner, burnt large masses of them, with little regard, as I apprehend, to discrimination. Not that I suppose we have thus been deprived of any compositions which he had ever intended for the publick eye; but, from what escaped the flames, I judge that many curious circumstances relating both to himself and other literary characters have perished.</p>
<p class="p24">Two very valuable articles, I am sure, we have lost, which were two quarto volumes, containing a full, fair, and most particular account of his own life, from his earliest recollection. I owned to him, that having accidentally seen them, I had read a great deal in them; and apologizing for the liberty I had taken, asked him if I could help it. He placidly answered, &lsquo;Why, Sir, I do not think you could have helped it.&rsquo; I said that I had, for once in my life, felt half an inclination to commit theft. It had come into my mind to carry off those two volumes, and never see him more. Upon my inquiring how this would have affected him, &lsquo;Sir, (said he,) I believe I should have gone mad.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">During his last illness, Johnson experienced the steady and kind attachment of his numerous friends. Mr. Hoole has drawn up a narrative of what passed in the visits which he paid him during that time, from the both of November to the 13th of December, the day of his death, inclusive, and has favoured me with a perusal of it, with permission to make extracts, which I have done. Nobody was more attentive to him than Mr. Langton, to whom he tenderly said, Te teneam moriens deficiente manu<span class="t8">. And I think it highly to the honour of Mr. Windham, that his important occupations as an active statesman did not prevent him from paying assiduous respect to the dying Sage whom he revered. Mr. Langton informs me, that, &lsquo;one day he found Mr. Burke and four or five more friends sitting with Johnson. Mr. Burke said to him, &ldquo;I am afraid, Sir, such a number of us may be oppressive to you.&rdquo; &ldquo;No, Sir, (said Johnson,) it is not so; and I must be in a wretched state, indeed, when your company would not be a delight to me.&rdquo; Mr. Burke, in a tremulous voice, expressive of being very tenderly affected, replied, &ldquo;My dear Sir, you have always been too good to me.&rdquo; Immediately afterwards he went away. This was the last circumstance in the acquaintance of these two eminent men.&rsquo;</span></p>
<p class="p24">The following particulars of his conversation within a few days of his death, I give on the authority of Mr. John Nichols: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;He said, that the Parliamentary Debates were the only part of his writings which then gave him any compunction: but that at the time he wrote them, he had no conception he was imposing upon the world, though they were frequently written from very slender materials, and often from none at all, &mdash; the mere coinage of his own imagination. He never wrote any part of his works with equal velocity. Three columns of the Magazine<span class="t8">, in an hour, was no uncommon effort, which was faster than most persons could have transcribed that quantity.</span></p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Of his friend Cave, he always spoke with great affection. &ldquo;Yet (said he,) Cave, (who never looked out of his window, but with a view to the Gentleman&rsquo;s Magazine<span class="t8">,) was a penurious pay-master; he would contract for lines by the hundred, and expect the long hundred; but he was a good man, and always delighted to have his friends at his table.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;When talking of a regular edition of his own works, he said, &ldquo;that he had power, [from the booksellers,] to print such an edition, if his health admitted it; but had no power to assign over any edition, unless he could add notes, and so alter them as to make them new works; which his state of health forbade him to think of. I may possibly live, (said he,) or rather breath, three days, or perhaps three weeks; but find myself daily and gradually weaker.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;He said at another time, three or four days only before his death, speaking of the little fear he had of undergoing a chirurgical operation, &ldquo;I would give one of these legs for a year more of life, I mean of comfortable life, not such as that which I now suffer;&rdquo; &mdash; and lamented much his inability to read during his hours of restlessness; &ldquo;I used formerly, (he added,) when sleepless in bed, to read like a Turk<span class="t8">.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Whilst confined by his last illness, it was his regular practice to have the church-service read to him, by some attentive and friendly Divine. The Rev. Mr. Hoole performed this kind office in my presence for the last time, when, by his own desire, no more than the Litany was read; in which his responses were in the deep and sonorous voice which Mr. Boswell has occasionally noticed, and with the most profound devotion that can be imagined. His hearing not being quite perfect, he more than once interrupted Mr. Hoole, with &ldquo;Louder, my dear Sir, louder, I entreat you, or you pray in vain!&rdquo; &mdash; and, when the service was ended, he, with great earnestness, turned round to an excellent lady who was present, saying, &ldquo;I thank you, Madam, very heartily, for your kindness in joining me in this solemn exercise. Live well, I conjure you; and you will not feel the compunction at the last, which I now feel.&rdquo; So truly humble were the thoughts which this great and good man entertained of his own approaches to religious perfection.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;He was earnestly invited to publish a volume of Devotional Exercises<span class="t8">; but this, (though he listened to the proposal with much complacency, and a large sum of money was offered for it,) he declined, from motives of the sincerest modesty.</span></p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;He seriously entertained the thought of translating Thuanus<span class="t8">. He often talked to me on the subject; and once, in particular, when I was rather wishing that he would favour the world, and gratify his sovereign, by a Life of Spenser, (which he said that he would readily have done, had he been able to obtain any new materials for the purpose,) he added, &ldquo;I have been thinking again, Sir, of</span> Thuanus<span class="t8">: it would not be the laborious task which you have supposed it. I should have no trouble but that of dictation, which would be performed as speedily as an amanuensis could write.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p24">It is to the mutual credit of Johnson and Divines of different communions, that although he was a steady Church-of-England man, there was, nevertheless, much agreeable intercourse between him and them. Let me particularly name the late Mr. La Trobe, and Mr. Hutton, of the Moravian profession. His intimacy with the English Benedictines, at Paris, has been mentioned; and as an additional proof of the charity in which he lived with good men of the Romish Church, I am happy in this opportunity of recording his friendship with the Reverend Thomas Hussey, D.D. His Catholick Majesty&rsquo;s Chaplain of Embassy at the Court of London, that very respectable man, eminent not only for his powerful eloquence as a preacher, but for his various abilities and acquisitions. Nay, though Johnson loved a Presbyterian the least of all, this did not prevent his having a long and uninterrupted social connection with the Reverend Dr. James Fordyce, who, since his death, hath gratefully celebrated him in a warm strain of devotional composition.</p>
<p class="p24">Amidst the melancholy clouds which hung over the dying Johnson, his characteristical manner shewed itself on different occasions.</p>
<p class="p24">When Dr. Warren, in the usual style, hoped that he was better; his answer was, &lsquo;No, Sir; you cannot conceive with what acceleration I advance towards death.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">A man whom he had never seen before was employed one night to sit up with him. Being asked next morning how he liked his attendant, his answer was, &lsquo;Not at all, Sir: the fellow&rsquo;s an ideot; he is as aukward as a turn-spit when first put into the wheel, and as sleepy as a dormouse.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Mr. Windham having placed a pillow conveniently to support him, he thanked him for his kindness, and said, &lsquo;That will do, &mdash; all that a pillow can do.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He repeated with great spirit a poem, consisting of several stanzas, in four lines, in alternate rhyme, which he said he had composed some years before, on occasion of a rich, extravagant young gentleman&rsquo;s coming of age; saying he had never repeated it but once since he composed it, and had given but one copy of it. That copy was given to Mrs. Thrale, now Piozzi, who has published it in a Book which she entitles British Synonymy<span class="t8">, but which is truly a collection of entertaining remarks and stories, no matter whether accurate or not. Being a piece of exquisite satire, conveyed in a strain of pointed vivacity and humour, and in a manner of which no other instance is to be found in Johnson&rsquo;s writings, I shall here insert it: &mdash; </span></p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long-expected one-and-twenty,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ling&rsquo;ring year, at length is flown;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pride and pleasure, pomp and plenty,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great &mdash;&mdash;&nbsp; &mdash; 1257, are now your own.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Loosen&rsquo;d from the Minor&rsquo;s tether,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Free to mortgage or to sell,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wild as wind, and light as feather,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bid the sons of thrift farewell.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call the Betseys, Kates, and Jennies,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the names that banish care;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lavish of your grandsire&rsquo;s guineas,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shew the spirit of an heir.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All that prey on vice or folly</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joy to see their quarry fly;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There the gamester, light and jolly,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There the lender, grave and sly.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wealth, my lad, was made to wander,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let it wander as it will;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call the jockey, call the pander,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bid them come and take their fill.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the bonny blade carouses,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pockets full, and spirits high &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are acres? what are houses?</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only dirt, or wet or dry.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should the guardian friend or mother</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tell the woes of wilful waste;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scorn their counsel, scorn their pother, &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can hang or drown at last.</p>
<p class="p24">As he opened a note which his servant brought to him, he said, &lsquo;An odd thought strikes me: we shall receive no letters in the grave.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He requested three things of Sir Joshua Reynolds: &mdash; To forgive him thirty pounds which he had borrowed of him; to read the Bible; and never to use his pencil on a Sunday. Sir Joshua readily acquiesced.</p>
<p class="p24">Indeed he shewed the greatest anxiety for the religious improvement of his friends, to whom he discoursed of its infinite consequence. He begged of Mr. Hoole to think of what he had said, and to commit it to writing: and, upon being afterwards assured that this was done, pressed his hands, and in an earnest tone thanked him. Dr. Brocklesby having attended him with the utmost assiduity and kindness as his physician and friend, he was peculiarly desirous that this gentleman should not entertain any loose speculative notions, but be confirmed in the truths of Christianity, and insisted on his writing down in his presence, as nearly as he could collect it, the import of what passed on the subject: and Dr. Brocklesby having complied with the request, he made him sign the paper, and urged him to keep it in his own custody as long as he lived.</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson, with that native fortitude, which, amidst all his bodily distress and mental sufferings, never forsook him, asked Dr. Brocklesby, as a man in whom he had confidence, to tell him plainly whether he could recover. &lsquo;Give me (said he) a direct answer.&rsquo; The Doctor having first asked him if he could bear the whole truth, which way soever it might lead, and being answered that he could, declared that, in his opinion, he could not recover without a miracle. &lsquo;Then, (said Johnson,) I will take no more physick, not even my opiates; for I have prayed that I may render up my soul to GOD unclouded.&rsquo; In this resolution he persevered, and, at the same time, used only the weakest kinds of sustenance. Being pressed by Mr. Windham to take somewhat more generous nourishment, lest too low a diet should have the very effect which he dreaded, by debilitating his mind, he said, &lsquo;I will take any thing but inebriating sustenance.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">The Reverend Mr. Strahan, who was the son of his friend, and had been always one of his great favourites, had, during his last illness, the satisfaction of contributing to soothe and comfort him. That gentleman&rsquo;s house, at Islington, of which he is Vicar, afforded Johnson, occasionally and easily, an agreeable change of place and fresh air; and he attended also upon him in town in the discharge of the sacred offices of his profession.</p>
<p class="p24">Mr. Strahan has given me the agreeable assurance, that, after being in much agitation, Johnson became quite composed, and continued so till his death.</p>
<p class="p24">Dr. Brocklesby, who will not be suspected of fanaticism, obliged me with the following accounts: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;For some time before his death, all his fears were calmed and absorbed by the prevalence of his faith, and his trust in the merits and propitiation <span class="t8">of JESUS CHRIST.</span></p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;He talked often to me about the necessity of faith in the sacrifice <span class="t8">of Jesus, as necessary beyond all good works whatever, for the salvation of mankind.</span></p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;He pressed me to study Dr. Clarke and to read his Sermons. I asked him why he pressed Dr. Clarke, an Arian. &ldquo;Because, (said he,) he is fullest on the propitiatory sacrifice<span class="t8">.&rdquo;&rsquo;</span></p>
<p class="p24">Johnson having thus in his mind the true Christian scheme, at once rational and consolatory, uniting justice and mercy in the DIVINITY, with the improvement of human nature, previous to his receiving the Holy Sacrament in his apartment, composed and fervently uttered this prayer: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Almighty and most merciful Father, I am now as to human eyes, it seems, about to commemorate, for the last time, the death of thy Son JESUS CHRIST, our Saviour and Redeemer. Grant, O LORD, that my whole hope and confidence may be in his merits, and thy mercy; enforce and accept my imperfect repentance; make this commemoration available to the confirmation of my faith, the establishment of my hope, and the enlargement of my charity; and make the death of thy Son JESUS CHRIST effectual to my redemption. Have mercy upon me, and pardon the multitude of my offences. Bless my friends; have mercy upon all men. Support me, by thy Holy Spirit, in the days of weakness, and at the hour of death; and receive me, at my death, to everlasting happiness, for the sake of JESUS CHRIST. Amen.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Having, as has been already mentioned, made his will on the 8th and 9th of December, and settled all his worldly affairs, he languished till Monday, the 13th of that month, when he expired, about seven o&rsquo;clock in the evening, with so little apparent pain that his attendants hardly perceived when his dissolution took place.</p>
<p class="p24">Of his last moments, my brother, Thomas David, has furnished me with the following particulars: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The Doctor, from the time that he was certain his death was near, appeared to be perfectly resigned, was seldom or never fretful or out of temper, and often said to his faithful servant, who gave me this account, &ldquo;Attend, Francis, to the salvation of your soul, which is the object of greatest importance:&rdquo; he also explained to him passages in the scripture, and seemed to have pleasure in talking upon religious subjects.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;On Monday, the 13th of December, the day on which he died, a Miss Morris, daughter to a particular friend of his, called, and said to Francis, that she begged to be permitted to see the Doctor, that she might earnestly request him to give her his blessing. Francis went into his room, followed by the young lady, and delivered the message. The Doctor turned himself in the bed, and said, &ldquo;GOD bless you, my dear!&rdquo; These were the last words he spoke. His difficulty of breathing increased till about seven o&rsquo;clock in the evening, when Mr. Barber and Mrs. Desmoulins, who were sitting in the room, observing that the noise he made in breathing had ceased, went to the bed, and found he was dead.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">About two days after his death, the following very agreeable account was communicated to Mr. Malone, in a letter by the Honourable John Byng, to whom I am much obliged for granting me permission to introduce it in my work.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Since I saw you, I have had a long conversation with Cawston, who sat up with Dr. Johnson, from nine o&rsquo;clock, on Sunday evening, till ten o&rsquo;clock, on Monday morning. And, from what I can gather from him, it should seem, that Dr. Johnson was perfectly composed, steady in hope, and resigned to death. At the interval of each hour, they assisted him to sit up in his bed, and move his legs, which were in much pain; when he regularly addressed himself to fervent prayer; and though, sometimes, his voice failed him, his senses never did, during that time. The only sustenance he received, was cyder and water. He said his mind was prepared, and the time to his dissolution seemed long. At six in the morning, he enquired the hour, and, on being informed, said that all went on regularly, and he felt he had but a few hours to live.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;At ten o&rsquo;clock in the morning, he parted from Cawston, saying, &ldquo;You should not detain Mr. Windham&rsquo;s servant: &mdash; I thank you; bear my remembrance to your master.&rdquo; Cawston says, that no man could appear more collected, more devout, or less terrified at the thoughts of the approaching minute.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;This account, which is so much more agreeable than, and somewhat different from, yours, has given us the satisfaction of thinking that that great man died as he lived, full of resignation, strengthened in faith, and joyful in hope.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">A few days before his death, he had asked Sir John Hawkins, as one of his executors, where he should be buried; and on being answered, &lsquo;Doubtless, in Westminster-Abbey,&rsquo; seemed to feel a satisfaction, very natural to a Poet; and indeed in my opinion very natural to every man of any imagination, who has no family sepulchre in which he can be laid with his fathers. Accordingly, upon Monday, December 20, his remains were deposited in that noble and renowned edifice; and over his grave was placed a large blue flag-stone, with this inscription: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obiit <span class="t8">XIII</span> die Decembris<span class="t8">,</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Anno Domini <span class="t8">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; M. DCC. LXXXIV.</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aetatis suoe</span> LXXV.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">His funeral was attended by a respectable number of his friends, particularly such of the members of the LITERARY CLUB as were then in town; and was also honoured with the presence of several of the Reverend Chapter of Westminster. Mr. Burke, Sir Joseph Banks, Mr. Windham, Mr. Langton, Sir Charles Bunbury, and Mr. Colman, bore his pall. His schoolfellow, Dr. Taylor, performed the mournful office of reading the burial service.</p>
<p class="p24">I trust, I shall not be accused of affectation, when I declare, that I find myself unable to express all that I felt upon the loss of such a &lsquo;Guide, Philosopher, and Friend.&rsquo; I shall, therefore, not say one word of my own, but adopt those of an eminent friend, which he uttered with an abrupt felicity, superior to all studied compositions:&mdash; &lsquo;He has made a chasm, which not only nothing can fill up, but which nothing has a tendency to fill up. Johnson is dead. Let us go to the next best: &mdash; there is nobody; no man can be said to put you in mind of Johnson.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">As Johnson had abundant homage paid to him during his life, so no writer in this nation ever had such an accumulation of literary honours after his death. A sermon upon that event was preached in St. Mary&rsquo;s Church, Oxford, before the University, by the Reverend Mr. Agutter, of Magdalen College. The <span class="t8">Lives</span>, the <span class="t8">Memoirs</span>, the <span class="t8">Essays</span>, both in prose and verse, which have been published concerning him, would make many volumes. The numerous attacks too upon him, I consider as part of his consequence, upon the principle which he himself so well knew and asserted. Many who trembled at his presence, were forward in assault, when they no longer apprehended danger. When one of his little pragmatical foes was invidiously snarling at his fame, at Sir Joshua Reynolds&rsquo;s table, the Reverend Dr. Parr exclaimed, with his usual bold animation, &lsquo;Ay, now that the old lion is dead, every ass thinks he may kick at him.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">A monument for him, in Westminster Abbey, was resolved upon soon after his death, and was supported by a most respectable contribution; but the Dean and Chapter of St. Paul&rsquo;s having come to a resolution of admitting monuments there, upon a liberal and magnificent plan, that Cathedral was afterwards fixed on, as the place in which a cenotaph should be erected to his memory: and in the cathedral of his native city of Lichfield, a smaller one is to be erected. To compose his epitaph, could not but excite the warmest competition of genius. If <span class="t8">laudari à laudato viro</span> be praise which is highly estimable, I should not forgive myself were I to omit the following sepulchral verses on the authour of THE ENGLISH DICTIONARY, written by the Right Honourable Henry Flood: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;No need of Latin or of Greek to grace</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our JOHNSON&rsquo;S memory, or inscribe his grave;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His native language claims this mournful space,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To pay the Immortality he gave.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">The character of SAMUEL JOHNSON has, I trust, been so developed in the course of this work, that they who have honoured it with a perusal, may be considered as well acquainted with him. As, however, it may be expected that I should collect into one view the capital and distinguishing features of this extraordinary man, I shall endeavour to acquit myself of that part of my biographical undertaking, however difficult it may be to do that which many of my readers will do better for themselves.</p>
<p class="p24">His figure was large and well formed, and his countenance of the cast of an ancient statue; yet his appearance was rendered strange and somewhat uncouth, by convulsive cramps, by the scars of that distemper which it was once imagined the royal touch could cure, and by a slovenly mode of dress. He had the use only of one eye; yet so much does mind govern and even supply the deficiency of organs, that his visual perceptions, as far as they extended, were uncommonly quick and accurate. So morbid was his temperament, that he never knew the natural joy of a free and vigorous use of his limbs: when he walked, it was like the struggling gait of one in fetters; when he rode, he had no command or direction of his horse, but was carried as if in a balloon. That with his constitution and habits of life he should have lived seventy-five years, is a proof that an inherent <span class="t8">vivida vis</span> is a powerful preservative of the human frame.</p>
<p class="p24">Man is, in general, made up of contradictory qualities; and these will ever shew themselves in strange succession, where a consistency in appearance at least, if not in reality, has not been attained by long habits of philosophical discipline. In proportion to the native vigour of the mind, the contradictory qualities will be the more prominent, and more difficult to be adjusted; and, therefore, we are not to wonder, that Johnson exhibited an eminent example of this remark which I have made upon human nature. At different times, he seemed a different man, in some respects; not, however, in any great or essential article, upon which he had fully employed his mind, and settled certain principles of duty, but only in his manners, and in the display of argument and fancy in his talk. He was prone to superstition, but not to credulity. Though his imagination might incline him to a belief of the marvellous and the mysterious, his vigorous reason examined the evidence with jealousy. He was a sincere and zealous Christian, of high Church-of-England and monarchical principles, which he would not tamely suffer to be questioned; and had, perhaps, at an early period, narrowed his mind somewhat too much, both as to religion and politicks. His being impressed with the danger of extreme latitude in either, though he was of a very independent spirit, occasioned his appearing somewhat unfavourable to the prevalence of that noble freedom of sentiment which is the best possession of man. Nor can it be denied, that he had many prejudices; which, however, frequently suggested many of his pointed sayings, that rather shew a playfulness of fancy than any settled malignity. He was steady and inflexible in maintaining the obligations of religion and morality; both from a regard for the order of society, and from a veneration for the GREAT SOURCE of all order; correct, nay stern in his taste; hard to please, and easily offended; impetuous and irritable in his temper, but of a most humane and benevolent heart, which shewed itself not only in a most liberal charity, as far as his circumstances would allow, but in a thousand instances of active benevolence. He was afflicted with a bodily disease, which made him often restless and fretful; and with a constitutional melancholy, the clouds of which darkened the brightness of his fancy, and gave a gloomy cast to his whole course of thinking: we, therefore, ought not to wonder at his sallies of impatience and passion at any time; especially when provoked by obtrusive ignorance, or presuming petulance; and allowance must be made for his uttering hasty and satirical sallies even against his best friends. And, surely, when it is considered, that, &lsquo;amidst sickness and sorrow,&rsquo;he exerted his faculties in so many works for the benefit of mankind, and particularly that he atchieved the great and admirable DICTIONARY of our language, we must be astonished at his resolution. The solemn text, &lsquo;of him to whom much is given, much will be required,&rsquo; seems to have been ever present to his mind, in a rigorous sense, and to have made him dissatisfied with his labours and acts of goodness, however comparatively great; so that the unavoidable consciousness of his superiority was, in that respect, a cause of disquiet. He suffered so much from this, and from the gloom which perpetually haunted him, and made solitude frightful, that it may be said of him, &lsquo;If in this life only he had hope, he was of all men most miserable.&rsquo; He loved praise, when it was brought to him; but was too proud to seek for it. He was somewhat susceptible of flattery. As he was general and unconfined in his studies, he cannot be considered as master of any one particular science; but he had accumulated a vast and various collection of learning and knowledge, which was so arranged in his mind, as to be ever in readiness to be brought forth. But his superiority over other learned men consisted chiefly in what may be called the art of thinking, the art of using his mind; a certain continual power of seizing the useful substance of all that he knew, and exhibiting it in a clear and forcible manner; so that knowledge, which we often see to be no better than lumber in men of dull understanding, was, in him, true, evident, and actual wisdom. His moral precepts are practical; for they are drawn from an intimate acquaintance with human nature. His maxims carry conviction; for they are founded on the basis of common sense, and a very attentive and minute survey of real life. His mind was so full of imagery, that he might have been perpetually a poet; yet it is remarkable, that, however rich his prose is in this respect, his poetical pieces, in general, have not much of that splendour, but are rather distinguished by strong sentiment and acute observation, conveyed in harmonious and energetick verse, particularly in heroick couplets. Though usually grave, and even aweful, in his deportment, he possessed uncommon and peculiar powers of wit and humour; he frequently indulged himself in colloquial pleasantry; and the heartiest merriment was often enjoyed in his company; with this great advantage, that as it was entirely free from any poisonous tincture of vice or impiety, it was salutary to those who shared in it. He had accustomed himself to such accuracy in his common conversation, that he at all times expressed his thoughts with great force, and an elegant choice of language, the effect of which was aided by his having a loud voice, and a slow deliberate utterance. In him were united a most logical head with a most fertile imagination, which gave him an extraordinary advantage in arguing: for he could reason close or wide, as he saw best for the moment. Exulting in his intellectual strength and dexterity, he could, when he pleased, be the greatest sophist that ever contended in the lists of declamation; and, from a spirit of contradiction and a delight in shewing his powers, he would often maintain the wrong side with equal warmth and ingenuity; so that, when there was an audience, his real opinions could seldom be gathered from his talk; though when he was in company with a single friend, he would discuss a subject with genuine fairness: but he was too conscientious to make errour permanent and pernicious, by deliberately writing it; and, in all his numerous works, he earnestly inculcated what appeared to him to be the truth; his piety being constant, and the ruling principle of all his conduct.</p>
<p class="p24">Such was SAMUEL JOHNSON, a man whose talents, acquirements, and virtues, were so extraordinary, that the more his character is considered, the more he will be regarded by the present age, and by posterity, with admiration and reverence.</p>
