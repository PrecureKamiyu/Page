We start with a <b>platter</b>, a circular hard surface on which data is stored persistently by inducing magnetic changes to it. A disk may have one or more platters; each platter has 2 sides, each of which is called a <b>sur- face</b>. These platters are usually made of some hard material (such as aluminum), and then coated with a thin magnetic layer that enables the drive to persistently store bits even when the drive is powered off.</p><p style="padding-left: 68pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">The platters are all bound together around the <b>spindle</b>, which is con- nected to a motor that spins the platters around (while the drive is pow- ered on) at a constant (fixed) rate. The rate of rotation is often measured in <b>rotations per minute (RPM)</b>, and typical modern values are in the 7,200 RPM to 15,000 RPM range. Note that we will often be interested in the time of a single rotation, e.g., a drive that rotates at 10,000 RPM means that a single rotation takes about 6 milliseconds (6 ms).</p><p style="padding-left: 68pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Data is encoded on each surface in concentric circles of sectors; we call one such concentric circle a <b>track</b>. A single surface contains many thou- sands and thousands of tracks, tightly packed together, with hundreds of tracks fitting into the width of a human hair.</p><p style="padding-left: 68pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">To read and write from the surface, we need a mechanism that allows us to either sense (i.e., read) the magnetic patterns on the disk or to in- duce a change in (i.e., write) them. This process of reading and writing is accomplished by the <b>disk head</b>; there is one such head per surface of the drive. The disk head is attached to a single <b>disk arm</b>, which moves across the surface to position the head over the desired track.</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part379.htm">&lt; 上一个</a><span> | </span><a href="../ostep.html">内容</a><span> | </span><a href="part381.htm">下一个 &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
