A ledger in the ﬁnancial world is a book of ﬁnancial accounts, that keeps track of trans- actions. For example, each time you deposit or withdraw money from your account, an entry is added to a ledger maintained by the bank. Since the ledger is maintained by the bank, a customer of the bank implicitly trusts the bank to not cheat by adding unau- thorized transactions to the ledger, such as an unauthorized withdrawal, or modifying the ledger by deleting transactions such as a deposit.</p><p style="padding-left: 119pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">Blockchain-based distributed ledgers maintain a ledger cooperatively among sev- eral parties, in such a way that each transaction is digitally signed as proof of authen- ticity, and further, the ledger is maintained in such a way that once entries are added, they cannot be deleted or modiﬁed by one party, without detection by others.</p><p style="padding-left: 119pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: right;">Blockchains form a key foundation of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Al- though much of the technology underlying blockchains was initially developed in the 1980s and 1990s, blockchain technology gained widespread popular attention in the 2010s as a result of boom (and subsequent bust) in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. However, beyond the many cryptocurrency schemes, blockchains can provide a secure data-storage and data-processing foundation for business applications, without requiring complete trust in any one party. For example, consider a large corporation and its suppliers, all of whom maintain data about where products and components are located at any time as part of the manufacturing process. Even if the organiza- tions are presumed trustworthy, there may a situation where one of them has a strong incentive to cheat and rewrite the record. A blockchain can help protect from such fraudulent updates. Ownership documents, such as real-estate deeds, are another ex- ample of the potential for blockchain use. Criminals may commit real-estate fraud by creating fake ownership deeds, which could allow them to sell a property that they do not own, or could allow the same property to be sold multiple times by an actual owner. Blockchains can help verify the authenticity of digitally represented ownership documents; blockchains can also ensure that once an owner has sold a property, the</p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 119pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;">1251</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 88pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark561">owner cannot sell it again to another person without getting detected. The security provided by the blockchain data structure makes it possible to allow the public to view these real-estate records without putting them at risk. We describe other applications for blockchains later in the chapter.</a><a name="bookmark591">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="padding-left: 88pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">In this chapter, we shall look at blockchain from a database perspective. We shall identify the ways in which blockchain databases diﬀer from the traditional databases we have studied elsewhere in this book and show how these distinguishing features are implemented. We shall consider alternatives to Bitcoin-style algorithms and implemen- tation that are more suited to an enterprise database environment. With this database- oriented focus, we shall not consider the ﬁnancial implications of cryptocurrencies, nor the issues of managing one’s holding of such currencies via a cryptocurrency wallet or exchange.</p><p class="toc">&nbsp;</p><div class="toc"><a class="toc0" href="part461.htm">26.1  Overview</a><a class="toc0" href="part462.htm">26.2  Blockchain Properties</a><a class="toc1" href="part463.htm">block 0 genesis block</a><a class="toc0" href="part464.htm">26.3  Achieving Blockchain Properties via Cryptographic Hash Functions</a><a class="toc0" href="part465.htm">26.4  Consensus</a><a class="toc0" href="part466.htm">26.5  Data Management in a Blockchain</a><a class="toc0" href="part467.htm">26.6  Smart Contracts</a><a class="toc0" href="part468.htm">26.7  Performance Enhancement</a><a class="toc0" href="part469.htm">26.8  Emerging Applications</a><a class="toc0" href="part470.htm">26.9  Summary</a><a class="toc0" href="part471.htm">Review Terms</a><a class="toc0" href="part472.htm">Practice Exercises</a><a class="toc0" href="part473.htm">Exercises</a><a class="toc0" href="part474.htm">Tools</a><a class="toc0" href="part475.htm">Further Reading</a><a class="toc0" href="part476.htm">Bibliography</a><a class="toc0" href="part477.htm">Credits</a></div><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part459.htm">&lt; 上一个</a><span> | </span><a href="../database.html">内容</a><span> | </span><a href="part461.htm">下一个 &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
