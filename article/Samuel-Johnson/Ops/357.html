<h2 class="h20"><a id="a797"></a>No. 65. SATURDAY, JULY 14, 1759.</h2>
<p class="p21">This sequel of Clarendon&rsquo;s history, at last happily published, is an accession to English literature equally agreeable to the admirers of elegance and the lovers of truth; many doubtful facts may now be ascertained, and many questions, after long debate, may be determined by decisive authority. He that records transactions in which himself was engaged, has not only an opportunity of knowing innumerable particulars which escape spectators, but has his natural powers exalted by that ardour which always rises at the remembrance of our own importance, and by which every man is enabled to relate his own actions better than another&rsquo;s.</p>
<p class="p24">The difficulties through which this work has struggled into light, and the delays with which our hopes have been long mocked, naturally lead the mind to the consideration of the common fate of posthumous compositions.</p>
<p class="p24">He who sees himself surrounded by admirers, and whose vanity is hourly feasted with all the luxuries of studied praise, is easily persuaded that his influence will be extended beyond his life; that they who cringe in his presence will reverence his memory, and that those who are proud to be numbered among his friends, will endeavour to vindicate his choice by zeal for his reputation.</p>
<p class="p24">With hopes like these, to the executors of Swift was committed the history of the last years of queen Anne, and to those of Pope, the works which remained unprinted in his closet. The performances of Pope were burnt by those whom he had, perhaps, selected from all mankind as most likely to publish them; and the history had likewise perished, had not a straggling transcript fallen into busy hands.</p>
<p class="p24">The papers left in the closet of Pieresc supplied his heirs with a whole winter&rsquo;s fuel; and many of the labours of the learned Bishop Lloyd were consumed in the kitchen of his descendants.</p>
<p class="p24">Some works, indeed, have escaped total destruction, but yet have had reason to lament the fate of orphans exposed to the frauds of unfaithful guardians. How Hale would have borne the mutilations which his Pleas of the Crown have suffered from the editor, they who know his character will easily conceive.</p>
<p class="p24">The original copy of Burnet&rsquo;s history, though promised to some publick library, has been never given; and who then can prove the fidelity of the publication, when the authenticity of Clarendon&rsquo;s history, though printed with the sanction of one of the first universities of the world, had not an unexpected manuscript been happily discovered, would, with the help of factious credulity, have been brought into question by the two lowest of all human beings, a scribbler for a party, and a commissioner of excise?</p>
<p class="p24">Vanity is often no less mischievous than negligence or dishonesty. He that possesses a valuable manuscript, hopes to raise its esteem by concealment, and delights in the distinction which he imagines himself to obtain by keeping the key of a treasure which he neither uses nor imparts. From him it falls to some other owner, less vain but more negligent, who considers it as useless lumber, and rids himself of the encumbrance.</p>
<p class="p24">Yet there are some works which the authors must consign unpublished to posterity, however uncertain be the event, however hopeless be the trust. He that writes the history of his own times, if he adheres steadily to truth, will write that which his own times will not easily endure. He must be content to reposite his book, till all private passions shall cease, and love and hatred give way to curiosity.</p>
<p class="p24">But many leave the labours of half their life to their executors and to chance, because they will not send them abroad unfinished, and are unable to finish them, having prescribed to themselves such a degree of exactness as human diligence can scarcely attain. &ldquo;Lloyd&rdquo;, says Burnet, &ldquo;did not lay out his learning with the same diligence as he laid it in.&rdquo; He was always hesitating and inquiring, raising objections and removing them, and waiting for clearer light and fuller discovery. Baker, after many years passed in biography, left his manuscripts to be buried in a library, because that was imperfect which could never be perfected.</p>
<p class="p24">Of these learned men, let those who aspire to the same praise imitate the diligence, and avoid the scrupulosity. Let it be always remembered that life is short, that knowledge is endless, and that many doubts deserve not to be cleared. Let those whom nature and study have qualified to teach mankind, tell us what they have learned while they are yet able to tell it, and trust their reputation only to themselves.</p>
<p class="p24">See Preface.</p>
<p class="p24">It would be proper to reposite, in some public place, the manuscript of Clarendon, which has not escaped all suspicion of unfaithful publication.</p>
<p class="p24">The manuscript of Clarendon is now in the Bodleian library at Oxford, and the editor of the present edition has it before him while writing this note. He may likewise add, that a new and emended edition is now printing from the original MS. at the Clarendon press. December, 1824.</p>
<p class="p26">See Preface.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s hatred of the excise reminds us of John Wesley&rsquo;s<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wailing philippic against turnpike gates, which he denounced as the<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;most cruel of impositions on the way-faring man.</p>
