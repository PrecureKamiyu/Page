On the left-most point of the hexagon is router U; the top left is router V; the top right is router W; the bottom left is router X; the bottom right is router Y; and the right-most point is router Z. The routers are connected to each other with numbered lines representing edge costs: router U is connected to X with a line designated as 1; X is connected to Y with a line designated as 1; Y is connected to Z with a line designated as 2; Z is connected to W with a line designated as 5; W is connected to V with a line designated as 3; V is connected to U with a line designated as 2; V is connected to X with a line designated as 2; W is connected to X with a line designated as 3; W is connected to Y with a line designated as 1.</p></div></section></body></html>
