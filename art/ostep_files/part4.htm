It is an honor for us to provide some material to help you in your pursuit of knowledge about operating systems. We both think back fondly towards some textbooks of our undergraduate days (e.g., Hennessy and Patterson [HP90], the classic book on computer architec- ture) and hope this book will become one of those positive memories for you.</p><p class="s5" style="padding-left: 68pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: justify;">You may have noticed this book is free and available online. There is one major reason for this: textbooks are generally too expensive. This book, we hope, is the first of a new wave of free materials to help those in pursuit of their education, regardless of which part of the world they come from or how much they are willing to spend for a book. Failing that, it is one free book, which is better than none.</p><p class="s5" style="padding-left: 68pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: justify;">We also hope, where possible, to point you to the original sources of much of the material in the book: the great papers and persons who have shaped the field of operating systems over the years. Ideas are not pulled out of the air; they come from smart and hard-working people (including numerous Turing-award winners<span class="s10">2</span>), and thus we should strive to celebrate those ideas and people where possible. In doing so, we hopefully can better understand the revolutions that have taken place, instead of writing texts as if those thoughts have always been present [K62]. Further, perhaps such references will encourage you to dig deeper on your own; reading the famous papers of our field is certainly one of the best ways to learn.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 68pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="154" height="1" alt="image" src="Image_004.png"/></span></p><p class="s11" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 68pt;text-indent: 13pt;line-height: 92%;text-align: left;">2<span class="s12">The Turing Award is the highest award in Computer Science; it is like the Nobel Prize, except that you have never heard of it.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part3.htm">&lt; 上一个</a><span> | </span><a href="../ostep.html">内容</a><span> | </span><a href="part5.htm">下一个 &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
