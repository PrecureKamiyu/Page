Determining when to clean is easier; either periodically, dur- ing idle time, or when you have to because the disk is full.</p><p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Determining which blocks to clean is more challenging, and has been the subject of many research papers. In the original LFS paper [RO91], the authors describe an approach which tries to segregate <i>hot </i>and <i>cold </i>segment. A hot segment is one in which the contents are being frequently over-written; thus, for such a segment, the best policy is to wait a long time before cleaning it, as more and more blocks are getting over-written (in new segments) and thus being freed for use. A cold segment, in con- trast, may have a few dead blocks but the rest of its contents are relatively stable. Thus, the authors conclude that one should clean cold segments sooner and hot segments later, and develop a heuristic that does exactly that. However, as with most policies, this is just one approach, and by definition is not “the best” approach; later approaches show how to do better [MR+97].</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part488.htm">&lt; 上一个</a><span> | </span><a href="../ostep.html">内容</a><span> | </span><a href="part490.htm">下一个 &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
