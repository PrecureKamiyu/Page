		<h1>What is group</h1>
		<p>
		You should know the definition of group and the definition of semigroup and monoid. The concept help you 
		to remember the definition of group and moreover give you a better perspective.
		</p>
		<p>
		A group is a monoid where every element has inverse. 
		</p>
		<p>
		You may somehow start realizing why the associative that is required in the definition matters when you
		are requested to prove that there is only one identity in a monoid. 
		</p>
		<h1>Structure of group</h1>
		<p>You should know what is subgroup and more importantly, what is the inner structure in one group.</p>
		<h2>A simple example</h2>
		<p>Here is a not so easy exercise. Consider \( \varphi\) is a homomorphism from \(G\) to \(G\), which suits
		that \( \varphi ^{2} = \bf 1\) where \(\bf 1\) is the identity map. If there is no element in \(G\) except \(1\) suits that 
		the element 
		is mapped to itself by the homo \(\varphi\), that is \( \neg \exists \). then the order of \(G\) is odd and \(G\) is an abelian group
		(You already know that \(G\) is finite). </p>

		<p>Note there could be only one homo suits the condition of \(\varphi\). The existence of \(\varphi\) implies 
		the structure of the group (that is, the finite group has odd number of elements and is abelian)</p>
		<p>You can figure out why \(\vert G\vert\) is odd, which is, frankly speaking, <b>trivial</b>. </p>
		<p>Anyway, we can use \(\varphi\) to construct a homo that shows the structure of the group.</p>
		\[h \colon G\to G, g\mapsto g^{-1} \varphi (g) \]
		<p>I admit, you have to prove that it is a homomorphism. You can show that if \(h\) is a homo, then 
		Im\(\,h\) is an abelian group. The homo which implies the structure of the group is constructed based on a homo which
		seem so harmless. One may feel uneasy about this fact. At least, I haven't heard of some strange 
		kinds of functions on \(\mathbb R\) which implies the structure of \(\mathbb R\).
		Let us come back to our subject. 
		In this case \(h\) is an <b>Automorphism</b> (we can prove that). So Im\(\, h = G\) is abelian.</p>
		<h2>A further example</h2>
		<p>
		A further example shows the structure under the existence of 
		the mysterious homo \(\varphi\) which suits that \(\varphi ^2  = \bf 1\).
		</p>
		<p>Given a finite group which has odd number of elements. There is a homo \(\varphi\) suits that 
		\(\varphi = \bf 1\). Let 
		\[G_1 = \{\, g \mid g \in G, \varphi (g) = g \, \} \qquad G_2 =  \{\, g \mid g \in G , \varphi (g) = g ^{-1} \,\}\]
		You shall prove that \(G = G_1 G_2\).
		</p>
		<p>It is to say that \(G\) is consist of all elements that is the "compostion" of the elements in \(G_1\)
		or \(G_2\). It reminds me of vector space. Though the structure is completely different, you may seem 
		the element in \(G\) as a two-dimensional vector in a vector space where there is two base vectors which are 
		in 
		\(G_1\), \(G_2\) seperately(if \(G_1\) and \(G_2\) are cyclic groups we can actually assert that the statement is true.)</p>
		<p>The proof is not easy. You may use the \(h\) in previous example and classify the group by something like 
		\(g_1 \sim g_2\) iff \(Ag_1 = Ag_2\) where \(A\) is a subgroup (in this case, \(A = G_1\), that is to say
		\(G_1\) is a subgroup of \(G\), you should prove it).
		The fact that \(\alpha \colon G\to G, g \mapsto g^{\scriptscriptstyle 2}\) is an endomorphism will be used in your proof.</p>
		<h2>End of example</h2>
		<p>The existence of something implies the structure of something else. Above is just an example very non-trivial about 
		the homo of \(G\). Although limited is it, you may realize some classification in one group which is determined by the 
		homo (a function naturally defines a equivalence relation. \(a \sim b\) iff \(f (a) = f(b)\)).</p>
		<p>Of course, there are also some other structures that are implied by existence of something else.</p>
		<p>One of the structure is about the order of a group element.</p>

		<h1>Number theory in group</h1>
		<h2>A simple example</h2>
		<p> \(G\) is finite and has \(n\) elements. Give \(g_1, \ldots , g_m\), where \(m \ge n\), prove that 
		there exist two numbers \(a , b\) suits that \(1 \le a \le b \le m\) and \(g _a \ldots g_b = 1\)</p>
		<p>This one is pretty easy and is orthogonal to number theory.</p>
		<h2>Definition of order</h2>
		<p>If \(g \in G\) and \(m\) is the smallest positive integer that suits \( g ^m = 1\) then \(m\) is called 
		the order of \(g\). You may write ord\((g)\) to denote the order of \(g\).</p>
		<p>Order have a natural structure to talk about numbers. </p>

		<h1>Catergory of group</h1>
		<p>A special kind of group is worth studying for its special structure.</p>
