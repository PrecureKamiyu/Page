We begin our study of IP with an overview of the syntax and semantics of the IPv4 datagram. You might be thinking that nothing could be drier than the syntax and semantics of a packet’s bits. Nevertheless, the datagram plays a central role in the Internet—every networking student and professional needs to see it, absorb it, and master it. (And just to see that protocol headers can indeed be fun to study, check out <a class="biblioref" href="fileP70010119520000000000000000037E0.xhtml#P7001011952000000000000000003AB9" data-foobar="7">[Pomeranz 2010]</a>).

Most IP datagrams do not contain options, so the typical IP datagram has a 20-byte header.</p></li>

For example, it might be useful to distinguish real-time datagrams (such as those used by an IP telephony application) from non-real-time traffic (for example, FTP). The specific level of service to be provided is a policy issue determined and configured by the network administrator for that router. We also learned in <a class="xref" href="fileP700101195200000000000000000168F.xhtml#P7001011952000000000000000001762" data-foobar="7"><span class="label">Section</span> <span class="number">3.7.2</span></a> that two of the TOS bits are used for Explicit Congestion ­Notification.</p></li>

Since this field is 16 bits long, the theoretical maximum size of the IP datagram is 65,535 bytes. However, datagrams are rarely larger than 1,500 bytes, which allows an IP datagram to fit in the payload field of a maximally sized Ethernet frame.</p></li>
<li id="P700101195200000000000000000A895" data-uri="M04_KURO4140_07_SE_C04.xhtml#P700101195200000000000000000A895"><p id="P700101195200000000000000000A896" data-uri="M04_KURO4140_07_SE_C04.xhtml#P700101195200000000000000000A896"><span class="leadin">Identifier, flags, fragmentation offset.</span> These three fields have to do with so-called IP fragmentation, a topic we will consider shortly. Interestingly, the new version of IP, IPv6, does not allow for fragmentation.</p></li>

This field is decremented by one each time the datagram is processed by a router. If the TTL field reaches 0, a router must drop that datagram.</p></li>
<li id="P700101195200000000000000000A899" data-uri="M04_KURO4140_07_SE_C04.xhtml#P700101195200000000000000000A899"><p id="P700101195200000000000000000A89A" data-uri="M04_KURO4140_07_SE_C04.xhtml#P700101195200000000000000000A89A"><span class="leadin">Protocol.</span> This field is typically used only when an IP datagram reaches its final destination. The value of this field indicates the specific transport-layer protocol to which the data portion of this IP datagram should be passed. For example, a value of 6 indicates that the data portion is passed to TCP, while a value of 17 indicates that the data is passed to UDP. For a list of all possible values, see <a class="biblioref" href="fileP70010119520000000000000000037E0.xhtml#P700101195200000000000000000396C" data-foobar="7">[IANA Protocol Numbers 2016]</a>. Note that the protocol number in the IP datagram has a role that is analogous to the role of the port number field in the transport-layer segment. The protocol number is the glue that binds the network and transport layers together, whereas the port number is the glue that binds the transport and application layers together. We’ll see in <a class="xref" href="fileP70010119520000000000000000023B1.xhtml#P70010119520000000000000000023B1" data-foobar="7"><span class="label">Chapter</span> <span class="number">6</span></a> that the link-layer frame also has a special field that binds the link layer to the network layer.</p></li>

The header checksum is computed by treating each 2 bytes in the header as a number and summing these numbers using 1s complement arithmetic. As discussed in <a class="xref" href="fileP70010119520000000000000000011C0.xhtml#P70010119520000000000000000011C0" data-foobar="7"><span class="label">Section</span> <span class="number">3.3</span></a>, the 1s complement of this sum, known as the Internet checksum, is stored in the checksum field. A router computes the header checksum for each received IP datagram and detects an error condition if <span class="pagebreak" title="332" id="P7001011952000000000000000001B55" data-uri="M04_KURO4140_07_SE_C04.xhtml#P7001011952000000000000000001B55" epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>the checksum carried in the datagram header does not equal the computed checksum. Routers typically discard datagrams for which an error has been detected. Note that the checksum must be recomputed and stored again at each router, since the TTL field, and possibly the options field as well, will change. An interesting discussion of fast algorithms for computing the Internet checksum is <a class="biblioref" href="fileP70010119520000000000000000037E0.xhtml#P7001011952000000000000000003AF5" data-foobar="7">[RFC 1071]</a>. A question often asked at this point is, why does TCP/IP perform error checking at both the transport and network layers? There are several reasons for this repetition. First, note that only the IP header is checksummed at the IP layer, while the TCP/UDP checksum is computed over the entire TCP/UDP segment. Second, TCP/UDP and IP do not necessarily both have to belong to the same protocol stack. TCP can, in principle, run over a different network-layer protocol (for example, ATM) <a class="biblioref" href="fileP70010119520000000000000000037E0.xhtml#P7001011952000000000000000003841" data-foobar="7">[Black 1995]</a>) and IP can carry data that will not be passed to TCP/UDP.</p></li>

Often the source host determines the destination address via a DNS lookup, as discussed in <a class="xref" href="fileP700101195200000000000000000096B.xhtml#P700101195200000000000000000096B" data-foobar="7"><span class="label">Chapter</span> <span class="number">2</span></a>.

Header options were meant to be used rarely—hence the decision to save overhead by not including the information in options fields in every datagram header. However, the mere existence of options does complicate matters—since datagram headers can be of variable length, one cannot determine a priori where the data field will start. Also, since some datagrams may require options processing and others may not, the amount of time needed to process an IP datagram at a router can vary greatly. These considerations become particularly important for IP processing in high-performance routers and hosts. For these reasons and others, IP options were not included in the IPv6 header, as discussed in <a class="xref" href="#P7001011952000000000000000001C7C" data-foobar="1"><span class="label">Section</span> <span class="number">4.3.5</span></a>.</p></li>

In most circumstances, the data field of the IP datagram contains the transport-layer segment (TCP or UDP) to be delivered to the destination.

Because each IP datagram is encapsulated within the link-layer frame for transport from one router to the next router, the MTU of the link-layer protocol places a hard limit on the length of an IP datagram. Having a hard limit on the size of an IP datagram is not much of a problem. What is a problem is that each of the links along the route between sender and destination can use different link-layer protocols, and each of these protocols can have different MTUs.</p>

Suppose you receive an IP datagram from one link. You check your forwarding table to determine the outgoing link, and this outgoing link has an MTU that is smaller than the length of the IP datagram. Time to panic—how are you going to squeeze this oversized IP datagram into the payload field of the link-layer frame? The solution is to fragment the payload in the IP datagram into two or more smaller IP datagrams, encapsulate each of these smaller IP datagrams in a separate link-layer frame; and send these frames over the outgoing link.

Indeed, both TCP and UDP are expecting to receive complete, unfragmented segments from the network layer. The designers of IPv4 felt that reassembling datagrams in the routers would introduce significant complication into the protocol and put a damper on router performance. (If you were a router, would you want to be reassembling fragments on top of everything else you had to do?) Sticking to the principle of keeping the network core simple, the designers of IPv4 decided to put the job of datagram reassembly in the end systems rather than in network routers.</p>
<p id="P700101195200000000000000000A8A8" data-uri="M04_KURO4140_07_SE_C04.xhtml#P700101195200000000000000000A8A8">When a destination host receives a series of datagrams from the same source, it needs to determine whether any of these datagrams are fragments of some original, larger datagram. If some datagrams are fragments, it must further determine when it has received the last fragment and how the fragments it has received should be pieced back together to form the original datagram. To allow the destination host to perform these reassembly tasks, the designers of IP (version 4) put <i>identification, flag,</i> and <i>fragmentation offset</i> fields in the IP datagram header. When a datagram is created, the sending host stamps the datagram with an identification number as well as source and destination addresses. Typically, the sending host increments the identification number for each datagram it sends. When a router needs to fragment a datagram, each resulting datagram (that is, fragment) is stamped with the source address, destination address, and identification number of the original datagram. When the destination receives a series of datagrams from the same sending host, it can examine the identification numbers of the datagrams to determine which of the datagrams are actually fragments of the same larger datagram. Because IP is an unreliable service, one or more of the fragments may never arrive at the destination.

A host typically has only a single link into the network; when IP in the host wants to send a datagram, it does so over this link. The boundary between the host and the physical link is called an <span class="keyword" id="P7001011952000000000000000001B75" data-uri="M04_KURO4140_07_SE_C04.xhtml#P7001011952000000000000000001B75"><b>interface</b></span>. Now consider a router and its interfaces. Because a router’s job is to receive a datagram on one link and forward the datagram on some other link, a router necessarily has two or more links to which it is connected. The boundary between the router and any one of its links is also called an interface. A router thus has multiple interfaces, one for each of its links. Because every host and router is capable of sending and receiving IP datagrams, IP requires each host and router interface to have its own IP address. <i>Thus, an IP address is technically associated with an interface, rather than with the host or router containing that interface.</i></p>

For example, suppose the first 21 bits of the CIDRized address a.b.c.d/21 specify the organization’s network prefix and are common to the IP addresses of all devices in that organization. The remaining 11 bits then identify the specific hosts in the organization.

The requirement that the subnet portion of an IP address be exactly 1, 2, or 3 bytes long turned out to be problematic for supporting the rapidly growing number of organizations with small and medium-sized subnets. A class C (/24) subnet could accommodate only up to 2<sup>8</sup> − 2 = 254 hosts (two of the 2<sup>8</sup> = 256 addresses are reserved for special use)—too small for many organizations. However, a class B (/16) subnet, which supports up to 65,634 hosts, was too large. Under classful addressing, an organization with, say, 2,000 hosts was typically allocated a class B (/16) subnet address. This led to a rapid depletion of the class B address space and poor utilization of the assigned address space. For example, the organization that used a class B address for its 2,000 hosts was allocated enough of the address space for up to 65,534 interfaces—leaving more than 63,000 addresses that could not be used by other organizations.</p>

But this is a costly solution, and Organization 1 might well be reassigned to another subsidiary in the future. The solution typically adopted is for Organization 1 to keep its IP addresses in 200.23.18.0/23.

However, ISPs-R-Us now <i>also</i> advertises the block of addresses for Organization 1, 200.23.18.0/23. When other routers in the larger Internet see the address blocks 200.23.16.0/20 (from Fly-By-Night-ISP) and 200.23.18.0/23 (from ISPs-R-Us) and want to route to an address in the block 200.23.18.0/23, they will use <i>longest prefix matching</i> (see <a class="xref" href="fileP7001011952000000000000000001A2A.xhtml#P7001011952000000000000000001A4E" data-foobar="7"><span class="label">Section</span> <span class="number">4.2.1</span></a>), and route toward ISPs-R-Us, as it advertises the longest (i.e., most-specific) address prefix that matches the destination address.</p>

Clearly, there must also be a way for the ISP itself to get a block of addresses. Is there a global authority that has ultimate responsibility for managing the IP address space and allocating address blocks to ISPs and other organizations? Indeed there is! IP addresses are managed under the authority of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) <a class="biblioref" href="fileP70010119520000000000000000037E0.xhtml#P7001011952000000000000000003970" data-foobar="7">[ICANN 2016]</a>, based on guidelines set forth in <a class="biblioref" href="fileP70010119520000000000000000037E0.xhtml#P7001011952000000000000000003BC3" data-foobar="7">[RFC 7020]</a>. The role of the nonprofit ICANN organization [NTIA 1998] is not only to allocate IP addresses, but also to manage the DNS root servers. It also has the very contentious job of assigning domain names and resolving domain name disputes. The ICANN allocates addresses to regional Internet registries (for example, ARIN, RIPE, APNIC, and LACNIC, which together form the Address Supporting Organization of ICANN <a class="biblioref" href="fileP70010119520000000000000000037E0.xhtml#P7001011952000000000000000003811" data-foobar="7">[ASO-ICANN 2016]</a>), and handle the allocation/management of addresses within their regions.</p>

This capability makes it <i>very</i> attractive to the network administrator who would otherwise have to perform these tasks manually! DHCP is also enjoying widespread use in residential Internet access networks, enterprise networks, and in wireless LANs, where hosts join and leave the network frequently. Consider, for example, the student who carries a laptop from a dormitory room to a library to a classroom. It is likely that in each location, the student will be connecting into a new subnet and hence will need a new IP address at each location. DHCP is ideally suited to this situation, as there are many users coming and going, and addresses are needed for only a limited amount of time. The value of DHCP’s plug-and-play capability is clear, since it’s unimaginable that a system administrator would be able to reconfigure laptops at each location, and few students (except those taking a computer networking class!) would have the expertise to configure their laptops manually.</p>

With the proliferation of small office, home office (SOHO) subnets, this would seem to imply that whenever a SOHO wants to install a LAN to connect multiple machines, a range of addresses would need to be allocated by the ISP to cover all of the SOHO’s IP devices (including phones, tablets, gaming devices, IP TVs, printers and more). If the subnet grew bigger, a larger block of addresses would have to be allocated. But what if the ISP had already allocated the contiguous portions of the SOHO network’s current address range? And what typical homeowner wants (or should need) to know how to manage IP addresses in the first place? Fortunately, there is a simpler approach to address allocation that has found increasingly widespread use in such scenarios: <span class="keyword" id="P7001011952000000000000000001C3D" data-uri="M04_KURO4140_07_SE_C04.xhtml#P7001011952000000000000000001C3D">network address translation (NAT)</span> <a class="biblioref" href="fileP70010119520000000000000000037E0.xhtml#P7001011952000000000000000003B47" data-foobar="7">[RFC 2663</a>; <a class="biblioref" href="fileP70010119520000000000000000037E0.xhtml#P7001011952000000000000000003B51" data-foobar="7">RFC 3022</a>; <a class="biblioref" href="fileP70010119520000000000000000037E0.xhtml#P700101195200000000000000000395F" data-foobar="7">Huston 2004</a>, <a class="biblioref" href="fileP70010119520000000000000000037E0.xhtml#P7001011952000000000000000003C9E" data-foobar="7">Zhang 2007</a>; <a class="biblioref" href="fileP70010119520000000000000000037E0.xhtml#P7001011952000000000000000003896" data-foobar="7">Cisco NAT 2016]</a>.</p>

Instead the NAT router behaves to the outside world as a <i>single</i> device with a <i>single</i> IP address.

In essence, the NAT-enabled router is hiding the details of the home network from the outside world. (As an aside, you might wonder where the home network computers get their addresses and where the router gets its single IP address. Often, the answer is the same—DHCP! The router gets its address from the ISP’s DHCP server, and the router runs a DHCP server to provide addresses to computers within the NAT-DHCP-router-controlled home network’s address space.)</p>

Suppose a user sitting in a home network behind host 10.0.0.1 requests a Web page on some Web server (port 80) with IP address 128.119.40.186. The host 10.0.0.1 assigns the (arbitrary) source port number 3345 and sends the datagram into the LAN. The NAT router receives the datagram, generates a new source port number 5001 for the datagram, replaces the source IP address with its WAN-side IP address 138.76.29.7, and replaces the original source port number 3345 with the new source port number 5001. When generating a new source port number, the NAT router can select any source port number that is not currently in the NAT translation table. (Note that because a port number field is 16 bits long, the NAT protocol can support over 60,000 simultaneous connections with a single WAN-side IP address for the router!) NAT in the router also adds an entry to its NAT translation table. The Web server, blissfully unaware that the arriving datagram containing the HTTP request has been manipulated by the NAT router, responds with a datagram whose destination address is the IP address of the NAT router, and whose destination port number is 5001. When this datagram arrives at the NAT router, the router indexes the NAT translation table using the destination IP address and destination port number to obtain the appropriate IP address (10.0.0.1) and destination port number (3345) for the browser in the home network. The router then rewrites the datagram’s destination address and destination port number, and forwards the datagram into the home network.</p>

Here, the concern is that routers are meant to be layer 3 (i.e., network-layer) devices, and should process packets only up to the network layer. NAT violates this principle that hosts should be talking directly with each other, without interfering nodes modifying IP addresses, much less port numbers.

<p id="P700101195200000000000000000A979" data-uri="M04_KURO4140_07_SE_C04.xhtml#P700101195200000000000000000A979">Suppose you are assigned the task of administering a home, departmental, university, or corporate network. Attackers, knowing the IP address range of your network, can easily send IP datagrams to addresses in your range. These datagrams can do all kinds of devious things, including mapping your network with ping sweeps and port scans, crashing vulnerable hosts with malformed packets, scanning for open TCP/UDP ports on servers in your network, and infecting hosts by including malware in the packets. As the network administrator, what are you going to do about all those bad guys out there, each capable of sending malicious packets into your network? Two popular defense mechanisms to malicious packet attacks are firewalls and intrusion detection systems (IDSs).</p>
<p id="P700101195200000000000000000A97A" data-uri="M04_KURO4140_07_SE_C04.xhtml#P700101195200000000000000000A97A">As a network administrator, you may first try installing a firewall between your network and the Internet. (Most access routers today have firewall capability.) Firewalls inspect the datagram and segment header fields, denying suspicious datagrams entry into the internal network. For example, a firewall may be configured to block all ICMP echo request packets (see <a class="xref" href="fileP70010119520000000000000000021F0.xhtml#P70010119520000000000000000021F0" data-foobar="7"><span class="label">Section</span> <span class="number">5.6</span></a>), thereby preventing an attacker from doing a traditional port scan across your IP address range. Firewalls can also block packets based on source and destination IP addresses and port numbers. Additionally, firewalls can be configured to track TCP connections, granting entry only to datagrams that belong to approved connections.</p>
<p id="P700101195200000000000000000A97B" data-uri="M04_KURO4140_07_SE_C04.xhtml#P700101195200000000000000000A97B">Additional protection can be provided with an IDS. An IDS, typically situated at the network boundary, performs “deep packet inspection,” examining not only header fields but also the payloads in the datagram (including application-layer data). An IDS has a database of packet signatures that are known to be part of attacks. This database is automatically updated as new attacks are discovered. As packets pass through the IDS, the IDS attempts to match header fields and payloads to the signatures in its signature database. If such a match is found, an alert is created. An intrusion prevention system (IPS) is similar to an IDS, except that it actually blocks packets in addition to creating alerts. In <a class="xref" href="fileP7001011952000000000000000002D4B.xhtml#P7001011952000000000000000002D4B" data-foobar="7"><span class="label">Chapter</span> <span class="number">8</span></a>, we’ll explore firewalls and IDSs in more detail.</p>

The answer is clearly no, as attackers continually find new attacks for which signatures are not yet available. But firewalls and traditional signature-based IDSs are useful in protecting your network from known attacks.</p>

To respond to this need for a large IP address space, a new IP protocol, IPv6, was developed. The designers of IPv6 also took this opportunity to tweak and augment other aspects of IPv4, based on the accumulated operational experience with IPv4.</p>

If an IPv6 datagram received by a router is too large to be forwarded over the outgoing link, the router simply drops the datagram and sends a “Packet Too Big” ICMP error message (see <a class="xref" href="fileP70010119520000000000000000021F0.xhtml#P70010119520000000000000000021F0" data-foobar="7"><span class="label">Section</span> <span class="number">5.6</span></a>) back to the sender. The sender can then resend the data, using a smaller IP datagram size. Fragmentation and reassembly is a time-consuming operation; removing this functionality from the routers and placing it squarely in the end systems considerably speeds up IP forwarding within the network.</p></li>

Once again, fast processing of IP packets was a central concern. Recall from our discussion of IPv4 in <a class="xref" href="#P7001011952000000000000000001B40" data-foobar="1"><span class="label">Section</span> <span class="number">4.3.1</span></a> that since the IPv4 header contains a TTL field (similar to the hop limit field in IPv6), the IPv4 header checksum needed to be recomputed at every router. As with fragmentation and reassembly, this too was a costly operation in IPv4.</p></li>

However, it has not gone away. Instead, the options field is one of the possible next headers pointed to from within the IPv6 header. That is, just as TCP or UDP protocol headers can be the next header within an IP packet, so too can an options field. The removal of the options field results in a fixed-length, 40-byte IP header.</p></li>

The problem is that while new IPv6-capable systems can be made backward-compatible, that is, can send, route, and receive IPv4 datagrams, already deployed IPv4-capable systems are not capable of handling IPv6 datagrams.

The last major technology transition (from using NCP to using TCP for reliable transport service) occurred almost 35 years ago.

With tunneling, the IPv6 node on the sending side of the tunnel (in this example, B) takes the <i>entire</i> IPv6 datagram and puts it in the data (payload) field of an IPv4 datagram. This IPv4 datagram is then addressed to the IPv6 node on the receiving side of the tunnel (in this example, E) and sent to the first node in the tunnel (in this example, C). The intervening IPv4 routers in the tunnel route this IPv4 datagram among themselves, just as they would any other datagram, blissfully unaware that the IPv4 datagram itself contains a complete IPv6 datagram. The IPv6 node on the receiving side of the tunnel eventually receives the IPv4 datagram (it is the destination of the IPv4 datagram!), determines that the IPv4 datagram contains an IPv6 datagram (by observing that the protocol number field in the IPv4 datagram is 41 <a class="biblioref" href="fileP70010119520000000000000000037E0.xhtml#P7001011952000000000000000003B8F" data-foobar="7">[RFC 4213]</a>, indicating that the IPv4 payload is a IPv6 datagram), extracts the IPv6 datagram, and then routes the IPv6 datagram exactly as it would if it had received the IPv6 datagram from a directly connected IPv6 neighbor.</p>

Since the early 1990s, numerous new network-layer protocols have been trumpeted as the next major revolution for the Internet, but most of these protocols have had limited penetration to date. These protocols include IPv6, multicast protocols, and resource reservation protocols; a discussion of these latter two protocols can be found in the online supplement to this text. Indeed, introducing new protocols into the network layer is like replacing the foundation of a house—it is difficult to do without tearing the whole house down or at least temporarily relocating the house’s residents. On the other hand, the Internet has witnessed rapid deployment of new protocols at the application layer. The classic examples, of course, are the Web, instant messaging, streaming media, distributed games, and various forms of social media. Introducing new application-layer protocols is like adding a new layer of paint to a house—it is relatively easy to do, and if you choose an attractive color, others in the neighborhood will copy you. <span class="pagebreak" title="354" id="P7001011952000000000000000001CE2" data-uri="M04_KURO4140_07_SE_C04.xhtml#P7001011952000000000000000001CE2" epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>In summary, in the future we can certainly expect to see changes in the Internet’s network layer, but these changes will likely occur on a time scale that is much slower than the changes that will occur at the application layer.</p>
