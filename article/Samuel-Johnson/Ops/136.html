<p class="p21"><span class="t8">Legitimumque sonum digitis callemus et aure.</span></p>
<p class="p24">Hor. De Ar. Poet. 274.</p>
<p class="p24">By fingers, or by ear, we numbers scan.</p>
<p class="p24">Elphinston.</p>
<p class="p24">One of the ancients has observed, that the burthen of government is increased upon princes by the virtues of their immediate predecessors. It is, indeed, always dangerous&nbsp; to be placed in a state of unavoidable comparison with excellence, and the danger is still greater when that excellence is consecrated by death; when envy and interest cease to act against it, and those passions by which it was at first vilified and opposed, now stand in its defence, and turn their vehemence against honest emulation.</p>
<p class="p24">He that succeeds a celebrated writer, has the same difficulties to encounter; he stands under the shade of exalted merit, and is hindered from rising to his natural height, by the interception of those beams which should invigorate and quicken him. He applies to that attention which is already engaged, and unwilling to be drawn off from certain satisfaction; or perhaps to an attention already wearied, and not to be recalled to the same object.</p>
<p class="p24">One of the old poets congratulates himself that he had the untrodden regions of Parnassus before him, and that his garland will be gathered from plantations which no writer had yet culled. But the imitator treads a beaten walk, and with all his diligence can only hope to find a few flowers or branches untouched by his predecessor, the refuse of contempt, or the omissions of negligence. The Macedonian conqueror, when he was once invited to hear a man that sung like a nightingale, replied with contempt, &ldquo;that he had heard the nightingale herself;&rdquo; and the same treatment must every man expect, whose praise is that he imitates another.</p>
<p class="p24">Yet, in the midst of these discouraging reflections, I am about to offer to my reader some observations upon &ldquo;Paradise Lost,&rdquo; and hope, that, however I may fall below the illustrious writer who has so long dictated to the commonwealth of learning, my attempt may not be wholly useless. There are, in every age, new errours to be rectified, and new prejudices to be opposed. False taste is always busy to mislead those that are entering upon the regions of learning; and the traveller, uncertain of his way, and forsaken by the sun, will be pleased to see a fainter orb arise on the horizon, that may rescue him from total darkness, though with weak and borrowed lustre.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p24">Addison, though he has considered this poem under most of the general topicks of criticism, has barely touched upon the versification; not probably because he thought the art of numbers unworthy of his notice, for he knew with what minute attention the ancient criticks considered the disposition of syllables, and had himself given hopes of some metrical observations upon the great Roman poet; but being the first who undertook to display the beauties, and point out the defects of Milton, he had many objects at once before him, and passed willingly over those which were most barren of ideas, and required labour, rather than genius.</p>
<p class="p24">Yet versification, or the art of modulating his numbers, is indispensably necessary to a poet. Every other power by which the understanding is enlightened, or the imagination enchanted, may be exercised in prose. But the poet has this peculiar superiority, that to all the powers which the perfection of every other composition can require, he adds the faculty of joining music with reason, and of acting at once upon the senses and the passions. I suppose there are few who do not feel themselves touched by poetical melody, and who will not confess that they are more or less moved by the same thoughts, as they are conveyed by different sounds, and more affected by the same words in one order than in another. The perception of harmony is indeed conferred upon men in degrees very unequal, but there are none who do not perceive it, or to whom a regular series of proportionate sounds cannot give delight.</p>
<p class="p24">In treating on the versification of Milton, I am desirous to be generally understood, and shall therefore studiously decline the dialect of grammarians; though, indeed, it is always difficult, and sometimes scarcely possible, to deliver the precepts of an art, without the terms by which the peculiar ideas of that art are expressed, and which had not been invented but because the language already in use was insufficient. If, therefore, I shall sometimes seem obscure, it may be imputed to this voluntary interdiction, and to a desire of avoiding that offence which is always given by unusual words.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p24">The heroick measure of the English language may be properly considered as pure or mixed. It is pure when the accent rests upon every second syllable through the whole line.</p>
<p class="p24">Courage uncertain dangers may abate,</p>
<p class="p24">But whó can beár th&rsquo; appróach of cértain fáte.</p>
<p class="p24">Dryden.</p>
<p class="p24">Here love his golden shafts employs, here lights</p>
<p class="p24">His cónstant lámp, and wáves his púrple wíngs,</p>
<p class="p24">Reigns here, and revels; not in the bought smile</p>
<p class="p24">Of hárlots, lóveless, jóyless, únendéar&rsquo;d.</p>
<p class="p24">Milton.</p>
<p class="p24">The accent may be observed, in the second line of Dryden, and the second and fourth of Milton, to repose upon every second syllable.</p>
<p class="p24">The repetition of this sound or percussion at equal times, is the most complete harmony of which a single verse is capable, and should therefore be exactly kept in distichs, and generally in the last line of a paragraph, that the ear may rest without any sense of imperfection.</p>
<p class="p24">But, to preserve the series of sounds untransposed in a long composition, is not only very difficult, but tiresome and disgusting; for we are soon wearied with the perpetual recurrence of the same cadence. Necessity has therefore enforced the mixed measure, in which some variation of the accents is allowed; this, though it always injures the harmony of the line, considered by itself, yet compensates the loss by relieving us from the continual tyranny of the same sound, and makes us more sensible of the harmony of the pure measure.</p>
<p class="p24">Of these mixed numbers every poet affords us innumerable instances, and Milton seldom has two pure lines together, as will appear if any of his paragraphs be read with attention merely to the musick.</p>
<p class="p24">Thus at their shady lodge arriv&rsquo;d, both stood,</p>
<p class="p24">Both turn&rsquo;d, and under open sky ador&rsquo;d</p>
<p class="p24">The God that made both sky, air, earth, and heav&rsquo;n,</p>
<p class="p24">Which they beheld; the moon&rsquo;s resplendent globe,</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">And starry pole: thou also mad&rsquo;st the night,</span></p>
<p class="p24">Maker omnipotent! and thou the day,</p>
<p class="p24">Which we in our appointed work employ&rsquo;d</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p24">Have finish&rsquo;d, happy in our mutual help,</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">And mutual love, the crown of all our bliss,</span></p>
<p class="p24">Ordain&rsquo;d by thee; and this delicious place,</p>
<p class="p24">For us too large; where thy abundance wants</p>
<p class="p24">Partakers, and uncrop&rsquo;d falls to the ground;</p>
<p class="p24">But thou hast promis&rsquo;d from us two a race</p>
<p class="p24">To fill the earth, who shall with us extol</p>
<p class="p24">Thy goodness infinite, both when we wake,</p>
<p class="p24">And when we seek, as now, thy gift of sleep.</p>
<p class="p24">In this passage it will be at first observed, that all the lines are not equally harmonious, and upon a nearer examination it will be found that only the fifth and ninth lines are regular, and the rest are more or less licentious with respect to the accent. In some the accent is equally upon two syllables together, and in both strong. As</p>
<p class="p24">Thus at their shady lodge arriv&rsquo;d, <span class="t8">both stood</span>,</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Both turned</span>, and under open sky ador&rsquo;d</p>
<p class="p24">The God that made both sky, <span class="t8">air</span>, <span class="t8">earth</span>, and heav&rsquo;n.</p>
<p class="p24">In others the accent is equally upon two syllables, but upon both weak.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;&nbsp; &mdash;&mdash;&nbsp; &mdash;&mdash;&nbsp; &mdash;&mdash;&nbsp; &mdash;&mdash;&nbsp; &mdash;&mdash;&nbsp; &mdash; A race</p>
<p class="p24">To fill the earth, who shall with us extol</p>
<p class="p24">Thy goodness <span class="t8">infinite</span>, both when we wake,</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">And when</span> we seek, as now, thy gift of sleep.</p>
<p class="p24">In the first pair of syllables the accent may deviate from the rigour of exactness, without any unpleasing diminution of harmony, as may be observed in the lines already cited, and more remarkably in this,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;&nbsp; &mdash;&mdash;&nbsp; &mdash;&mdash; Thou also mad&rsquo;st the night,</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Maker</span> omnipotent! and thou the day,</p>
<p class="p24">But, excepting in the first pair of syllables, which may be considered as arbitrary, a poet who, not having the invention or knowledge of Milton, has more need to allure his audience by musical cadences, should seldom suffer more than one aberration from the rule in any single verse.</p>
<p class="p24">There are two lines in this passage more remarkably unharmonious:</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;&nbsp; &mdash;&mdash;&nbsp; &mdash;&mdash; This delicious place,</p>
<p class="p24">For us too large; <span class="t8">where thy</span> abundance wants</p>
<p class="p24">Partakers, and uncrop&rsquo;d <span class="t8">falls</span> to the ground,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p24">Here the third pair of syllables in the first, and fourth pair in the second verse, have their accents retrograde or inverted; the first syllable being strong or acute, and the second weak. The detriment which the measure suffers by this inversion of the accents is sometimes less perceptible, when the verses are carried one into another, but is remarkably striking in this place, where the vicious verse concludes a period, and is yet more offensive in rhyme, when we regularly attend to the flow of every single line. This will appear by reading a couplet in which Cowley, an author not sufficiently studious of harmony, has committed the same fault.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;&nbsp; &mdash;&mdash;&nbsp; &mdash;&mdash;&nbsp; &mdash;&mdash; His harmless life</p>
<p class="p24">Does with substantial blessedness abound,</p>
<p class="p24">And the soft wings of peace <span class="t8">cover</span> him round.</p>
<p class="p24">In these the law of metre is very grossly violated by mingling combinations of sound directly opposite to each other, as Milton expresses in his sonnet, by <span class="t8">committing short and long</span>, and setting one part of the measure at variance with the rest. The ancients, who had a language more capable of variety than ours, had two kinds of verse, the Iambick, consisting of short and long syllables alternately, from which our heroick measure is derived, and Trochaick, consisting in a like alternation of long and short. These were considered as opposites, and conveyed the contrary images of speed and slowness; to confound them, therefore, as in these lines, is to deviate from the established practice. But where the senses are to judge, authority is not necessary, the ear is sufficient to detect dissonance, nor should I have sought auxiliaries on such an occasion against any name but that of Milton.</p>
