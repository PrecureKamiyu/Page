<p id="P700101195200000000000000000B1C4" data-uri="M06_KURO4140_07_SE_C06.xhtml#P700101195200000000000000000B1C4">In this chapter, we’ve examined the link layer—its services, the principles underlying its operation, and a number of important specific protocols that use these principles in implementing link-layer services.</p>
<p id="P700101195200000000000000000B1C5" data-uri="M06_KURO4140_07_SE_C06.xhtml#P700101195200000000000000000B1C5">We saw that the basic service of the link layer is to move a network-layer datagram from one node (host, switch, router, WiFi access point) to an adjacent node. We saw that all link-layer protocols operate by encapsulating a network-layer datagram within a link-layer frame before transmitting the frame over the link to the adjacent node. Beyond this common framing function, however, we learned that different link-layer protocols provide very different link access, delivery, and transmission services. These differences are due in part to the wide variety of link types over which link-layer protocols must operate. A simple point-to-point link has a single sender and receiver communicating over a single “wire.” A multiple access link is shared among many senders and receivers; consequently, the link-layer protocol for a multiple access channel has a protocol (its multiple access protocol) for coordinating link access. In the case of MPLS, the “link” connecting two adjacent nodes (for example, two IP routers that are adjacent in an IP sense—that they are next-hop IP routers toward some destination) may actually be a <i>network</i> in and of itself. In one sense, the idea of a network being considered as a link should not seem odd. A telephone link connecting a home modem/computer to a remote modem/router, for example, is actually a path through a sophisticated and complex telephone <i>network.</i></p>

Much of the focus today at the link layer is on these switched networks. In the case of error detection/correction, we examined how it is possible to add additional bits to a frame’s header in order to detect, and in some cases correct, bit-flip errors that might occur when the frame is transmitted over the link. We covered simple parity and checksumming schemes, as well as the more robust cyclic redundancy check. We then moved on to the topic of multiple access protocols. We identified and studied three broad approaches for coordinating access to a broadcast channel: channel partitioning approaches (TDM, FDM), random access approaches (the ALOHA protocols and CSMA protocols), and taking-turns approaches (polling and token passing). We studied the cable access network and found that it uses many of these multiple access methods. We saw that a consequence of having multiple nodes share a single broadcast channel was the need to provide node addresses at the link layer. We learned that link-layer addresses were quite different from ­network-layer addresses and that, in the case of the Internet, a special protocol (ARP—the Address Resolution Protocol) is used to translate between these two forms of addressing and studied the hugely successful Ethernet protocol in detail. We then examined how nodes sharing a broadcast channel form a LAN and how multiple LANs can be connected together to form larger LANs—all <i>without</i> the intervention <span class="pagebreak" title="507" id="P7001011952000000000000000002787" data-uri="M06_KURO4140_07_SE_C06.xhtml#P7001011952000000000000000002787" epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>of network-layer routing to interconnect these local nodes. We also learned how ­multiple virtual LANs can be created on a single physical LAN infrastructure.</p>
<p id="P700101195200000000000000000B1C7" data-uri="M06_KURO4140_07_SE_C06.xhtml#P700101195200000000000000000B1C7">We ended our study of the link layer by focusing on how MPLS networks provide link-layer services when they interconnect IP routers and an overview of the network designs for today’s massive data centers. We wrapped up this chapter (and indeed the first five chapters) by identifying the many protocols that are needed to fetch a simple Web page. Having covered the link layer, <i>our journey down the protocol stack is now ove</i>r! Certainly, the physical layer lies below the link layer, but the details of the physical layer are probably best left for another course (for example, in communication theory, rather than computer networking). We have, however, touched upon several aspects of the physical layer in this chapter and in <a class="xref" href="fileP7001011952000000000000000000458.xhtml#P7001011952000000000000000000458" data-foobar="7"><span class="label">Chapter</span> <span class="number">1</span></a> (our discussion of physical media in <a class="xref" href="fileP70010119520000000000000000004B3.xhtml#P70010119520000000000000000004B3" data-foobar="7"><span class="label">Section</span> <span class="number">1.2</span></a>). We’ll consider the physical layer again when we study wireless link characteristics in the next chapter.</p>
<p id="P700101195200000000000000000B1C8" data-uri="M06_KURO4140_07_SE_C06.xhtml#P700101195200000000000000000B1C8">Although our journey down the protocol stack is over, our study of computer networking is not yet at an end. In the following three chapters we cover wireless networking, network security, and multimedia networking. These four topics do not fit conveniently into any one layer; indeed, each topic crosscuts many layers. Understanding these topics (billed as advanced topics in some networking texts) thus requires a firm foundation in all layers of the protocol stack—a foundation that our study of the link layer has now completed!</p>
