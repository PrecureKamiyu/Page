<h2 class="h20"><a id="a1916"></a>JULIUS CAESAR.</h2>
<p class="p21">Of this tragedy many particular passages deserve regard, and the contention and reconcilement of Brutus and Cassius is universally celebrated; but I have never been strongly agitated in perusing it, and think it somewhat cold and unaffecting, compared with some other of Shakespeare&rsquo;s plays; his adherence to the real story, and to Roman manners, seems to have impeded the natural vigour of his genius.</p>
