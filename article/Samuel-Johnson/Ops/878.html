<h2 class="h20"><a id="a2276"></a><a id="a2277"></a><a id="a2275"></a>ON THE DEATH OF MR. ROBERT LEVET, A PRACTISER IN PHYSICK.</h2>
<p class="p26">Condemn&rsquo;d to hope&rsquo;s delusive mine,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;As on we toil, from day to day,<br/>By sudden blasts, or slow decline,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our social comforts drop away.</p>
<p class="p26">Well try&rsquo;d, through many a varying year,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;See Levet to the grave descend,<br/>Officious, innocent, sincere,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Of ev&rsquo;ry friendless name the friend.</p>
<p class="p26">Yet still he fills affection&rsquo;s eye,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Obscurely wise, and coarsely kind;<br/>Nor, letter&rsquo;d arrogance, deny<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy praise to merit unrefined.</p>
<p class="p26">When fainting nature call&rsquo;d for aid,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;And hov&rsquo;ring death prepar&rsquo;d the blow,<br/>His vig&rsquo;rous remedy display&rsquo;d<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;The pow&rsquo;r of art, without the show.</p>
<p class="p26">In mis&rsquo;ry&rsquo;s darkest cavern known,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;His useful care was ever nigh,<br/>Where hopeless anguish pour&rsquo;d his groan,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;And lonely want retir&rsquo;d to die.</p>
<p class="p26">No summons, mock&rsquo;d by chill delay,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;No petty gain, disdain&rsquo;d by pride;<br/>The modest wants of ev&rsquo;ry day<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;The toil of ev&rsquo;ry day supply&rsquo;d.</p>
<p class="p26">His virtues walk&rsquo;d their narrow round,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor made a pause, nor left a void;<br/>And sure the eternal master found<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;The single talent well-employ&rsquo;d.</p>
<p class="p26">The busy day &mdash; the peaceful night,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfelt, uncounted, glided by;<br/>His frame was firm &mdash; his pow&rsquo;rs were bright,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Though now his eightieth year was nigh.</p>
<p class="p26">Then, with no fiery throbbing pain,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;No cold gradations of decay,<br/>Death broke, at once, the vital chain,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;And freed his soul the nearest way.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;These stanzas, to adopt the words of Dr. Drake, &ldquo;are warm from the heart; and this is the only poem, from the pen of Johnson, that has been bathed with tears.&rdquo; Levet was Johnson&rsquo;s constant and attentive companion, for near forty years; he was a practitioner in physic, among the lower class of people, in London. Humanity, rather than desire of gain, seems to have actuated this single hearted and amiable being; and never were the virtues of charity recorded in more touching strains. &ldquo;I am acquainted,&rdquo; says Dr. Drake, &ldquo;with nothing superior to them in the productions of the moral muse.&rdquo; See Drake&rsquo;s Literary Life of Johnson; and Boswell, i. ii. iii. iv. &mdash; ED.</p>
