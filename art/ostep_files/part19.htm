It’s called <b>Operating Systems in Three Easy Pieces</b>, and I am here to teach you the things you need to know about operating systems. I am called “Professor”; who are you?</p><p class="s27" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 92%;text-align: justify;">Student: <i>Hi Professor! I am called “Student”, as you might have guessed. And I am here and ready to learn!</i></p><p class="s27" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Professor: <i>Sounds good. Any questions?</i></p><p class="s27" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Student: <i>Sure! Why is it called “Three Easy Pieces”?</i></p><p class="s27" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 92%;text-align: justify;">Professor: <i>That’s an easy one. Well, you see, there are these great lectures on Physics by Richard Feynman...</i></p><p class="s27" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 92%;text-align: justify;">Student: <i>Oh! The guy who wrote “Surely You’re Joking, Mr. Feynman”, right? Great book! Is this going to be hilarious like that book was?</i></p><p class="s27" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 92%;text-align: justify;">Professor: <i>Um... well, no. That book was great, and I’m glad you’ve read it. Hopefully this book is more like his notes on Physics. Some of the basics were summed up in a book called “Six Easy Pieces”. He was talking about Physics; we’re going to do Three Easy Pieces on the fine topic of Operating Systems. This is appropriate, as Operating Systems are about half as hard as Physics.</i></p><p class="s27" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Student: <i>Well, I liked physics, so that is probably good. What are those pieces?</i></p><p class="s6" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 92%;text-align: justify;"><b>Professor: </b>They are the three key ideas we’re going to learn about: <b>virtualiza- tion</b>, <b>concurrency</b>, and <b>persistence</b>. In learning about these ideas, we’ll learn all about how an operating system works, including how it decides what program to run next on a CPU, how it handles memory overload in a virtual memory sys- tem, how virtual machine monitors work, how to manage information on disks, and even a little about how to build a distributed system that works when parts have failed. That sort of stuff.</p><p class="s27" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Student: <i>I have no idea what you’re talking about, really.</i></p><p class="s27" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Professor: <i>Good! That means you are in the right class.</i></p><p class="s27" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Student: <i>I have another question: what’s the best way to learn this stuff?</i></p><p class="s27" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Professor: <i>Excellent query! Well, each person needs to figure this out on their</i></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 68pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 92%;text-align: justify;">own, of course, but here is what I would do: go to class, to hear the professor introduce the material. Then, say at the end of every week, read these notes, to help the ideas sink into your head a bit better. Of course, some time later (hint: before the exam!), read the notes again to firm up your knowledge. Of course, your professor will no doubt assign some homeworks and projects, so you should do those; in particular, doing projects where you write real code to solve real problems is the best way to put the ideas within these notes into action. As Confucius said...</p><p class="s27" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 68pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 92%;text-align: justify;">Student: <i>Oh, I know! ’I hear and I forget. I see and I remember. I do and I understand.’ Or something like that.</i></p><p class="s27" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 68pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Professor: <i>(surprised) How did you know what I was going to say?!</i></p><p class="s27" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 68pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Student: <i>It seemed to follow. Also, I am a big fan of Confucius.</i></p><p class="s27" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 68pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Professor: <i>Well, I think we are going to get along just fine! Just fine indeed.</i></p><p class="s27" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 68pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 92%;text-align: justify;">Student: <i>Professor – just one more question, if I may. What are these dialogues for? I mean, isn’t this just supposed to be a book? Why not present the material directly?</i></p><p class="s27" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 68pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 92%;text-align: justify;">Professor: <i>Ah, good question, good question! Well, I think it is sometimes useful to pull yourself outside of a narrative and think a bit; these dialogues are those times. So you and I are going to work together to make sense of all of these pretty complex ideas. Are you up for it?</i></p><p class="s27" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 68pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 92%;text-align: justify;">Student: <i>So we have to think? Well, I’m up for that. I mean, what else do I have to do anyhow? It’s not like I have much of a life outside of this book.</i></p><p class="s27" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 68pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Professor: <i>Me neither, sadly. So let’s get to work!</i></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part18.htm">&lt; 上一个</a><span> | </span><a href="../ostep.html">内容</a><span> | </span><a href="part20.htm">下一个 &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
