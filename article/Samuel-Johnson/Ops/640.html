<p class="p10"><a id="a1383"></a><a id="a1381"></a><a id="a1382"></a><span class="t25">U</span></p>
<p class="p21">Has two powers, expressed in modern English by two characters, <span class="t8">V</span> consonant and <span class="t8">U</span> vowel, which ought to be considered as two letters; but as they were long confounded while the two uses were annexed to one form, the old custom still continues to be followed.</p>
<p class="p32"><span class="t8">U</span>, the vowel, has two sounds; one clear, expressed at other times by <span class="t8">eu</span>, as <span class="t8">obtuse</span>; the other close, and approaching to the Italian <span class="t8">u</span>, or English <span class="t8">oo</span>, as <span class="t8">obtund.</span></p>
<p class="p32"><span class="t8">V</span>, the consonant, has a sound nearly approaching to those of <span class="t8">b</span> and <span class="t8">f</span>. With <span class="t8">b</span> it is by the Spaniards and Gascons always confounded, and in the Runick alphabet is expressed by the same character with <span class="t8">f</span>, distinguished only by a diacritical point. Its sound in English is uniform. It is never mute.</p>

<p class="p32"><span class="t8">Umbre</span> is very sensible and earthy; there is nothing but pure black which can dispute with it. <span class="t8">Dryden.</span></p>

<p class="p32">2. A fish. [<span class="t8">thymallus</span>, Lat.]</p>
<p class="p32">The <span class="t8">umber</span> and grayling differ as the herring and pilcher do: but though they may do so in other nations, those in England differ nothing but in their names. <span class="t8">Walt. Angler.</span></p>
<p class="p32">Umbo. <span class="t8">n.s.</span> [Latin.] The point, or prominent part of a buckler.</p>
