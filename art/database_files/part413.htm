A number of these tools are also available on hosted cloud platforms.</p><p style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">Teradata was one of the ﬁrst commercial parallel database systems, and it continues to have a large market share. The Red Brick Warehouse was another early parallel database system; Red Brick was acquired by Informix, which was itself acquired by <span class="s44">IBM</span>. Other commercial parallel database systems include Teradata Aster Data, IBM Netezza, and Pivotal Greenplum. IBM Netezza, Pivotal Greenplum, and Teradata Aster Data all use <span class="s44">P</span>ostgre<span class="s44">SQL </span>as the underlying database, running independently on each node; each of these systems builds a layer on top, to partition data, and parallelize query processing across the nodes.</p><p style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">The open source Hadoop platform (<span class="s49">hadoop.apache.org</span>) includes the <span class="s44">HDFS </span>dis- tributed ﬁle system and the Hadoop MapReduce platform. Systems that support <span class="s44">SQL </span>on a MapReduce platform include Apache Hive (<span class="s49">hive.apache.org</span>), which originated at Facebook, Apache Impala (<span class="s49">impala.apache.org</span>), which originated at Cloudera, and Apache <span class="s44">HAWQ </span>(<span class="s49">hawq.apache.org</span>), which originated at Pivotal. Apache Spark (<span class="s49">spark.apache.org</span>), which originated at the Univ. of California, Berkeley, and Apache Tez (<span class="s49">tez.apache.org</span>) are parallel execution frameworks that support a variety of op- erators beyond the basic map and reduce operators; and Hive <span class="s44">SQL </span>queries can be exe- cuted on both these platforms. Other parallel execution frameworks include Apache Pig (<span class="s49">pig.apache.org</span>), which originated at Yahoo!, the Asterix system (<span class="s49">asterix.ics.uci.edu</span>), which originated at the University of California, Irvine, the Apache Flink system (<span class="s49">flink.apache.org</span>), which originated as the Stratosphere project at the Technical Uni- versity, Berlin, Humboldt University and the Hasso-Plattner Institute). Apache Spark and Apache Flink also support libraries for parallel machine learning.</p><p style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">These systems can access data stored in multiple diﬀerent data formats, such as ﬁles in diﬀerent formats in <span class="s44">HDFS</span>, or objects in a storage system such as HBase. Hadoop ﬁle formats were initially textual ﬁles, but today Hadoop implementations support sev- eral optimized ﬁle formats such as Sequence ﬁles (which allow binary data), Avro</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 119pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark483">(which supports semi-structured schemas) and Parquet (which supports columnar data representation).</a><a name="bookmark528">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="padding-left: 119pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">Apache  Kafka  (<span class="s49">kafka.apache.org</span>)  is  widely  used  for  routing  tu- ples  in  streaming  data  systems.  Systems  designed  for  query  process- ing  on  streaming  data  include  Apache  Storm  (<span class="s49">storm.apache.org</span>), Kafka  Streams  (<span class="s49">kafka.apache.org/documentation/streams/</span>)  and  Heron (<span class="s49">apache.github.io/incubator-heron/</span>),  developed  by  Twitter.  Apache  Flink (<span class="s49">flink.apache.org</span>), Spark Streaming (<span class="s49">spark.apache.org/streaming/</span>), the streaming component of Apache Spark, and Apache Apex (<span class="s49">apex.apache.org</span>) support analytics on streaming data along with analytics on stored data.</p><p style="padding-left: 119pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">Many of the above systems are also oﬀered as cloud-based services, as part of the cloud services oﬀered by Amazon AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, and other similar platforms.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part412.htm">&lt; 上一个</a><span> | </span><a href="../database.html">内容</a><span> | </span><a href="part414.htm">下一个 &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
