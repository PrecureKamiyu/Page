<p class="p24">The booksellers who contracted with Johnson, single and unaided, for the execution of a work, which in other countries has not been effected but by the co-operating exertions of many, were Mr. Robert Dodsley, Mr. Charles Hitch, Mr. Andrew Millar, the two Messieurs Longman, and the two Messieurs Knapton. The price stipulated was fifteen hundred and seventy-five pounds.</p>
<p class="p24">The <span class="t8">Plan</span> was addressed to Philip Dormer, Earl of Chesterfield, then one of his Majesty&rsquo;s Principal Secretaries of State; a nobleman who was very ambitious of literary distinction, and who, upon being informed of the design, had expressed himself in terms very favourable to its success. There is, perhaps in every thing of any consequence, a secret history which it would be amusing to know, could we have it authentically communicated. Johnson told me, &lsquo;Sir, the way in which the <span class="t8">Plan</span> of my <span class="t8">Dictionary</span> came to be inscribed to Lord Chesterfield, was this: I had neglected to write it by the time appointed. Dodsley suggested a desire to have it addressed to Lord Chesterfield. I laid hold of this as a pretext for delay, that it might be better done, and let Dodsley have his desire. I said to my friend, Dr. Bathurst, &ldquo;Now if any good comes of my addressing to Lord Chesterfield, it will be ascribed to deep policy, when, in fact, it was only a casual excuse for laziness.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">It is worthy of observation, that the <span class="t8">Plan</span> has not only the substantial merit of comprehension, perspicuity, and precision, but that the language of it is unexceptionably excellent; it being altogether free from that inflation of style, and those uncommon but apt and energetick words, which in some of his writings have been censured, with more petulance than justice; and never was there a more dignified strain of compliment than that in which he courts the attention of one who, he had been persuaded to believe, would be a respectable patron.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;With regard to questions of purity or propriety, (says he) I was once in doubt whether I should not attribute to myself too much in attempting to decide them, and whether my province was to extend beyond the proposition of the question, and the display of the suffrages on each side; but I have been since determined by your Lordship&rsquo;s opinion, to interpose my own judgement, and shall therefore endeavour to support what appears to me most consonant to grammar and reason. Ausonius thought that modesty forbade him to plead inability for a task to which Caesar had judged him equal:</p>
<p class="p24">Cur me pesse negem posse quod ille putat?</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;And I may hope, my Lord, that since you, whose authority in our language is so generally acknowledged, have commissioned me to declare my own opinion, I shall be considered as exercising a kind of vicarious jurisdiction; and that the power which might have been denied to my own claim, will be readily allowed me as the delegate of your Lordship.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">This passage proves, that Johnson&rsquo;s addressing his <span class="t8">Plan</span> to Lord Chesterfield was not merely in consequence of the result of a report by means of Dodsley, that the Earl favoured the design; but that there had been a particular communication with his Lordship concerning it. Dr. Taylor told me, that Johnson sent his <span class="t8">Plan</span> to him in manuscript, for his perusal; and that when it was lying upon his table, Mr. William Whitehead happened to pay him a visit, and being shewn it, was highly pleased with such parts of it as he had time to read, and begged to take it home with him, which he was allowed to do; that from him it got into the hands of a noble Lord, who carried it to Lord Chesterfield. When Taylor observed this might be an advantage, Johnson replied, &lsquo;No, Sir; it would have come out with more bloom, if it had not been seen before by any body.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">The opinion conceived of it by another noble authour, appears from the following extract of a letter from the Earl of Orrery to Dr. Birch:</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Caledon, Dec. 30, 1747.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I have just now seen the specimen of Mr. Johnson&rsquo;s Dictionary, addressed to Lord Chesterfield. I am much pleased with the plan, and I think the specimen is one of the best that I have ever read. Most specimens disgust, rather than prejudice us in favour of the work to follow; but the language of Mr. Johnson&rsquo;s is good, and the arguments are properly and modestly expressed. However, some expressions may be cavilled at, but they are trifles. I&rsquo;ll mention one. The <span class="t8">barren</span> Laurel. The laurel is not barren, in any sense whatever; it bears fruits and flowers. <span class="t8">Sed hae sunt nugae</span>, and I have great expectation from the performance.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">That he was fully aware of the arduous nature of the undertaking, he acknowledges; and shews himself perfectly sensible of it in the conclusion of his <span class="t8">Plan</span>; but he had a noble consciousness of his own abilities, which enabled him to go on with undaunted spirit.</p>
<p class="p24">Dr. Adams found him one day busy at his <span class="t8">Dictionary</span>, when the following dialogue ensued. &lsquo;ADAMS. This is a great work, Sir. How are you to get all the etymologies? JOHNSON. Why, Sir, here is a shelf with Junius, and Skinner, and others; and there is a Welch gentleman who has published a collection of Welch proverbs, who will help me with the Welch. ADAMS. But, Sir, how can you do this in three years? JOHNSON. Sir, I have no doubt that I can do it in three years. ADAMS. But the French Academy, which consists of forty members, took forty years to compile their Dictionary. JOHNSON. Sir, thus it is. This is the proportion. Let me see; forty times forty is sixteen hundred. As three to sixteen hundred, so is the proportion of an Englishman to a Frenchman.&rsquo; With so much ease and pleasantry could he talk of that prodigious labour which he had undertaken to execute.</p>
<p class="p24">The publick has had, from another pen, a long detail of what had been done in this country by prior Lexicographers; and no doubt Johnson was wise to avail himself of them, so far as they went: but the learned, yet judicious research of etymology, the various, yet accurate display of definition, and the rich collection of authorities, were reserved for the superior mind of our great philologist. For the mechanical part he employed, as he told me, six amanuenses; and let it be remembered by the natives of North-Britain, to whom he is supposed to have been so hostile, that five of them were of that country. There were two Messieurs Macbean; Mr. Shiels, who we shall hereafter see partly wrote the <span class="t8">Lives of the Poets</span> to which the name of Cibber is affixed; Mr. Stewart, son of Mr. George Stewart, bookseller at Edinburgh; and a Mr. Maitland. The sixth of these humble assistants was Mr. Peyton, who, I believe, taught French, and published some elementary tracts.</p>
<p class="p24">To all these painful labourers, Johnson shewed a never-ceasing kindness, so far as they stood in need of it. The elder Mr. Macbean had afterwards the honour of being Librarian to Archibald, Duke of Argyle, for many years, but was left without a shilling. Johnson wrote for him a Preface to <span class="t8">A System of Ancient Geography</span>; and, by the favour of Lord Thurlow, got him admitted a poor brother of the Charterhouse. For Shiels, who died, of a consumption, he had much tenderness; and it has been thought that some choice sentences in the <span class="t8">Lives of the Poets</span> were supplied by him. Peyton, when reduced to penury, had frequent aid from the bounty of Johnson, who at last was at the expense of burying both him and his wife.</p>
<p class="p24">While the <span class="t8">Dictionary</span> was going forward, Johnson lived part of the time in Holborn, part in Gough-square, Fleet-street; and he had an upper room fitted up like a counting-house for the purpose, in which he gave to the copyists their several tasks. The words, partly taken from other dictionaries, and partly supplied by himself, having been first written down with spaces left between them, he delivered in writing their etymologies, definitions, and various significations. The authorities were copied from the books themselves, in which he had marked the passages with a black-lead pencil, the traces of which could easily be effaced. I have seen several of them, in which that trouble had not been taken; so that they were just as when used by the copyists. It is remarkable, that he was so attentive in the choice of the passages in which words were authorised, that one may read page after page of his <span class="t8">Dictionary</span> with improvement and pleasure; and it should not pass unobserved, that he has quoted no authour whose writings had a tendency to hurt sound religion and morality.</p>
<p class="p24">The necessary expense of preparing a work of such magnitude for the press, must have been a considerable deduction from the price stipulated to be paid for the copy-right. I understand that nothing was allowed by the booksellers on that account; and I remember his telling me, that a large portion of it having by mistake been written upon both sides of the paper, so as to be inconvenient for the compositor, it cost him twenty pounds to have it transcribed upon one side only.</p>
<p class="p24">He is now to be considered as &lsquo;tugging at his oar,&rsquo; as engaged in a steady continued course of occupation, sufficient to employ all his time for some years; and which was the best preventive of that constitutional melancholy which was ever lurking about him, ready to trouble his quiet. But his enlarged and lively mind could not be satisfied without more diversity of employment, and the pleasure of animated relaxation. He therefore not only exerted his talents in occasional composition very different from Lexicography, but formed a club in Ivy-lane, Paternoster-row, with a view to enjoy literary discussion, and amuse his evening hours. The members associated with him in this little society were his beloved friend Dr. Richard Bathurst, Mr. Hawkesworth, afterwards well known by his writings, Mr. John Hawkins, an attorney, and a few others of different professions.</p>
<p class="p26">In the <span class="t8">Gentleman&rsquo;s Magazine</span> for May of this year he wrote a &lsquo;Life of<br/>Roscommon,&rsquo;[*] with Notes, which he afterwards much improved, indented<br/>the notes into text, and inserted it amongst his <span class="t8">Lives of the English<br/>Poets</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">Mr. Dodsley this year brought out his <span class="t8">Preceptor</span>, one of the most valuable books for the improvement of young minds that has appeared in any language; and to this meritorious work Johnson furnished &lsquo;The Preface,&rsquo;[*] containing a general sketch of the book, with a short and perspicuous recommendation of each article; as also, &lsquo;The Vision of Theodore the Hermit, found in his Cell,&rsquo;[*] a most beautiful allegory of human life, under the figure of ascending the mountain of Existence. The Bishop of Dromore heard Dr. Johnson say, that he thought this was the best thing he ever wrote.</p>
<p class="p24">1749: ÆTAT. 40. &mdash; In January, 1749, he published <span class="t8">The Vanity of Human Wishes, being the Tenth Satire of Juvenal imitated</span>. He, I believe, composed it the preceding year. Mrs. Johnson, for the sake of country air, had lodgings at Hampstead, to which he resorted occasionally, and there the greatest part, if not the whole, of this <span class="t8">Imitation</span> was written. The fervid rapidity with which it was produced, is scarcely credible. I have heard him say, that he composed seventy lines of it in one day, without putting one of them upon paper till they were finished.</p>
<p class="p24">I remember when I once regretted to him that he had not given us more of Juvenal&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Satires</span>, he said he probably should give more, for he had them all in his head; by which I understood that he had the originals and correspondent allusions floating in his mind, which he could, when he pleased, embody and render permanent without much labour. Some of them, however, he observed were too gross for imitation.</p>
<p class="p24">The profits of a single poem, however excellent, appear to have been very small in the last reign, compared with what a publication of the same size has since been known to yield. I have mentioned, upon Johnson&rsquo;s own authority, that for his <span class="t8">London</span> he had only ten guineas; and now, after his fame was established, he got for his <span class="t8">Vanity of Human Wishes</span> but five guineas more, as is proved by an authentick document in my possession.</p>
<p class="p24">It will be observed, that he reserves to himself the right of printing one edition of this satire, which was his practice upon occasion of the sale of all his writings; it being his fixed intention to publish at some period, for his own profit, a complete collection of his works.</p>
<p class="p24">His <span class="t8">Vanity of Human Wishes</span> has less of common life, but more of a philosophick dignity than his <span class="t8">London</span>. More readers, therefore, will be delighted with the pointed spirit of <span class="t8">London</span>, than with the profound reflection of <span class="t8">The Vanity of Human Wishes</span>. Garrick, for instance, observed in his sprightly manner, with more vivacity than regard to just discrimination, as is usual with wits, &lsquo;When Johnson lived much with the Herveys, and saw a good deal of what was passing in life, he wrote his <span class="t8">London</span>, which is lively and easy. When he became more retired, he gave us his <span class="t8">Vanity of Human Wishes</span>, which is as hard as Greek. Had he gone on to imitate another satire, it would have been as hard as Hebrew.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">But <span class="t8">The Vanity of Human Wishes</span> is, in the opinion of the best judges, as high an effort of ethick poetry as any language can shew. The instances of variety of disappointment are chosen so judiciously and painted so strongly, that, the moment they are read, they bring conviction to every thinking mind. That of the scholar must have depressed the too sanguine expectations of many an ambitious student. That of the warrior, Charles of Sweden, is, I think, as highly finished a picture as can possibly be conceived.</p>
<p class="p24">Were all the other excellencies of this poem annihilated, it must ever have our grateful reverence from its noble conclusion; in which we are consoled with the assurance that happiness may be attained, if we &lsquo;apply our hearts&rsquo; to piety:</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;Where then shall hope and fear their objects find?<br/>Shall dull suspense corrupt the stagnant mind?<br/>Must helpless man, in ignorance sedate,<br/>Roll darkling down the torrent of his fate?<br/>Shall no dislike alarm, no wishes rise,<br/>No cries attempt the mercy of the skies?<br/>Enthusiast, cease; petitions yet remain,<br/>Which Heav&rsquo;n may hear, nor deem Religion vain.<br/>Still raise for good the supplicating voice,<br/>But leave to Heaven the measure and the choice.<br/>Safe in His hand, whose eye discerns afar<br/>The secret ambush of a specious pray&rsquo;r;<br/>Implore His aid, in His decisions rest,<br/>Secure whate&rsquo;er He gives He gives the best.<br/>Yet when the sense of sacred presence fires,<br/>And strong devotion to the skies aspires,<br/>Pour forth thy fervours for a healthful mind,<br/>Obedient passions, and a will resign&rsquo;d;<br/>For love, which scarce collective man can fill,<br/>For patience, sovereign o&rsquo;er transmuted ill;<br/>For faith, which panting for a happier seat,<br/>Counts death kind Nature&rsquo;s signal for retreat.<br/>These goods for man the laws of Heaven ordain,<br/>These goods He grants, who grants the power to gain;<br/>With these celestial wisdom calms the mind,<br/>And makes the happiness she does not find.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Garrick being now vested with theatrical power by being manager of Drury-lane theatre, he kindly and generously made use of it to bring out Johnson&rsquo;s tragedy, which had been long kept back for want of encouragement. But in this benevolent purpose he met with no small difficulty from the temper of Johnson, which could not brook that a drama which he had formed with much study, and had been obliged to keep more than the nine years of Horace, should be revised and altered at the pleasure of an actor. Yet Garrick knew well, that without some alterations it would not be fit for the stage. A violent dispute having ensued between them, Garrick applied to the Reverend Dr. Taylor to interpose. Johnson was at first very obstinate. &lsquo;Sir, (said he) the fellow wants me to make Mahomet run mad, that he may have an opportunity of tossing his hands and kicking his heels.&rsquo; He was, however, at last, with difficulty, prevailed on to comply with Garrick&rsquo;s wishes, so as to allow of some changes; but still there were not enough.</p>
<p class="p24">Dr. Adams was present the first night of the representation of <span class="t8">Irene</span>, and gave me the following account: &lsquo;Before the curtain drew up, there were catcalls whistling, which alarmed Johnson&rsquo;s friends. The Prologue, which was written by himself in a manly strain, soothed the audience, and the play went off tolerably, till it came to the conclusion, when Mrs. Pritchard, the heroine of the piece, was to be strangled upon the stage, and was to speak two lines with the bow-string round her neck. The audience cried out &ldquo;<span class="t8">Murder! Murder</span>!&rdquo; She several times attempted to speak; but in vain. At last she was obliged to go off the stage alive.&rsquo; This passage was afterwards struck out, and she was carried off to be put to death behind the scenes, as the play now has it. The Epilogue, as Johnson informed me, was written by Sir William Yonge. I know not how his play came to be thus graced by the pen of a person then so eminent in the political world.</p>
<p class="p24">Notwithstanding all the support of such performers as Garrick, Barry, Mrs. Cibber, Mrs. Pritchard, and every advantage of dress and decoration, the tragedy of <span class="t8">Irene</span> did not please the publick. Mr. Garrick&rsquo;s zeal carried it through for nine nights, so that the authour had his three nights&rsquo; profits; and from a receipt signed by him, now in the hands of Mr. James Dodsley, it appears that his friend Mr. Robert Dodsley gave him one hundred pounds for the copy, with his usual reservation of the right of one edition.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Irene</span>, considered as a poem, is intitled to the praise of superiour excellence. Analysed into parts, it will furnish a rich store of noble sentiments, fine imagery, and beautiful language; but it is deficient in pathos, in that delicate power of touching the human feelings, which is the principal end of the drama. Indeed Garrick has complained to me, that Johnson not only had not the faculty of producing the impressions of tragedy, but that he had not the sensibility to perceive them. His great friend Mr. Walmsley&rsquo;s prediction, that he would &lsquo;turn out a fine tragedy-writer,&rsquo; was, therefore, ill-founded. Johnson was wise enough to be convinced that he had not the talents necessary to write successfully for the stage, and never made another attempt in that species of composition.</p>
<p class="p24">When asked how he felt upon the ill success of his tragedy, he replied, &lsquo;Like the Monument;&rsquo; meaning that he continued firm and unmoved as that column. And let it be remembered, as an admonition to the <span class="t8">genus irritabile</span> of dramatick writers, that this great man, instead of peevishly complaining of the bad taste of the town, submitted to its decision without a murmur. He had, indeed, upon all occasions, a great deference for the general opinion: &lsquo;A man (said he) who writes a book, thinks himself wiser or wittier than the rest of mankind; he supposes that he can instruct or amuse them, and the publick to whom he appeals, must, after all, be the judges of his pretensions.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On occasion of his play being brought upon the stage, Johnson had a fancy that as a dramatick authour his dress should be more gay than what he ordinarily wore; he therefore appeared behind the scenes, and even in one of the side boxes, in a scarlet waistcoat, with rich gold lace, and a gold-laced hat. He humourously observed to Mr. Langton, that &lsquo;when in that dress he could not treat people with the same ease as when in his usual plain clothes.&rsquo; Dress indeed, we must allow, has more effect even upon strong minds than one should suppose, without having had the experience of it. His necessary attendance while his play was in rehearsal, and during its performance, brought him acquainted with many of the performers of both sexes, which produced a more favourable opinion of their profession than he had harshly expressed in his <span class="t8">Life of Savage</span>. With some of them he kept up an acquaintance as long as he and they lived, and was ever ready to shew them acts of kindness. He for a considerable time used to frequent the <span class="t8">Green Room</span>, and seemed to take delight in dissipating his gloom, by mixing in the sprightly chit-chat of the motley circle then to be found there. Mr. David Hume related to me from Mr. Garrick, that Johnson at last denied himself this amusement, from considerations of rigid virtue; saying, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll come no more behind your scenes, David; for the silk stockings and white bosoms of your actresses excite my amorous propensities.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">1750: ÆTAT. 41. &mdash; In 1750 he came forth in the character for which he was eminently qualified, a majestick teacher of moral and religious wisdom. The vehicle which he chose was that of a periodical paper, which he knew had been, upon former occasions, employed with great success. The <span class="t8">Tatler, Spectator</span>, and <span class="t8">Guardian</span>, were the last of the kind published in England, which had stood the test of a long trial; and such an interval had now elapsed since their publication, as made him justly think that, to many of his readers, this form of instruction would, in some degree, have the advantage of novelty. A few days before the first of his <span class="t8">Essays</span> came out, there started another competitor for fame in the same form, under the title of The <span class="t8">Tatler Revived</span>, which I believe was &lsquo;born but to die.&rsquo; Johnson was, I think, not very happy in the choice of his title, <span class="t8">The Rambler</span>, which certainly is not suited to a series of grave and moral discourses; which the Italians have literally, but ludicrously translated by <span class="t8">Il Vagabondo</span>; and which has been lately assumed as the denomination of a vehicle of licentious tales, <span class="t8">The Rambler&rsquo;s Magazine</span>. He gave Sir Joshua Reynolds the following account of its getting this name: &lsquo;What <span class="t8">must</span> be done, Sir, <span class="t8">will</span> be done. When I was to begin publishing that paper, I was at a loss how to name it. I sat down at night upon my bedside, and resolved that I would not go to sleep till I had fixed its title. <span class="t8">The Rambler</span> seemed the best that occurred, and I took it.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">With what devout and conscientious sentiments this paper was undertaken, is evidenced by the following prayer, which he composed and offered up on the occasion: &lsquo;Almighty GOD, the giver of all good things, without whose help all labour is ineffectual, and without whose grace all wisdom is folly; grant, I beseech Thee, that in this undertaking thy Holy Spirit may not be with-held from me, but that I may promote thy glory, and the salvation of myself and others: grant this, O LORD, for the sake of thy son JESUS CHRIST. Amen.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">The first paper of the <span class="t8">Rambler</span> was published on Tuesday the 20th of March, 1750; and its authour was enabled to continue it, without interruption, every Tuesday and Friday, till Saturday the 17th of March, 1752, on which day it closed. This is a strong confirmation of the truth of a remark of his, which I have had occasion to quote elsewhere, that &lsquo;a man may write at any time, if he will set himself doggedly to it;&rsquo; for, notwithstanding his constitutional indolence, his depression of spirits, and his labour in carrying on his <span class="t8">Dictionary</span>, he answered the stated calls of the press twice a week from the stores of his mind, during all that time; having received no assistance, except four billets in No. 10, by Miss Mulso, now Mrs. Chapone; No. 30, by Mrs. Catharine Talbot; No. 97, by Mr. Samuel Richardson, whom he describes in an introductory note as &lsquo;An author who has enlarged the knowledge of human nature, and taught the passions to move at the command of virtue;&rsquo; and Nos. 44 and 100 by Mrs. Elizabeth Carter.</p>
<p class="p24">Posterity will be astonished when they are told, upon the authority of Johnson himself, that many of these discourses, which we should suppose had been laboured with all the slow attention of literary leisure, were written in haste as the moment pressed, without even being read over by him before they were printed. It can be accounted for only in this way; that by reading and meditation, and a very close inspection of life, he had accumulated a great fund of miscellaneous knowledge, which, by a peculiar promptitude of mind, was ever ready at his call, and which he had constantly accustomed himself to clothe in the most apt and energetick expression. Sir Joshua Reynolds once asked him by what means he had attained his extraordinary accuracy and flow of language. He told him, that he had early laid it down as a fixed rule to do his best on every occasion, and in every company; to impart whatever he knew in the most forcible language he could put it in; and that by constant practice, and never suffering any careless expressions to escape him, or attempting to deliver his thoughts without arranging them in the clearest manner, it became habitual to him.</p>
<p class="p24">Yet he was not altogether unprepared as a periodical writer; for I have in my possession a small duodecimo volume, in which he has written, in the form of Mr. Locke&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Common-Place Book</span>, a variety of hints for essays on different subjects. He has marked upon the first blank leaf of it, &lsquo;To the 128th page, collections for the <span class="t8">Rambler</span>;&rsquo; and in another place, &lsquo;In fifty-two there were seventeen provided; in 97-21; in 190-25.&rsquo; At a subsequent period (probably after the work was finished) he added, &lsquo;In all, taken of provided materials, 30.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Sir John Hawkins, who is unlucky upon all occasions, tells us, that &lsquo;this method of accumulating intelligence had been practised by Mr. Addison, and is humourously described in one of the <span class="t8">Spectators</span>, wherein he feigns to have dropped his paper of <span class="t8">notanda</span>, consisting of a diverting medley of broken sentences and loose hints, which he tells us he had collected, and meant to make use of. Much of the same kind is Johnson&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Adversaria</span>&rsquo;. But the truth is, that there is no resemblance at all between them. Addison&rsquo;s note was a fiction, in which unconnected fragments of his lucubrations were purposely jumbled together, in as odd a manner as he could, in order to produce a laughable effect. Whereas Johnson&rsquo;s abbreviations are all distinct, and applicable to each subject of which the head is mentioned.</p>
<p class="p24">For instance, there is the following specimen:</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Youth&rsquo;s Entry, &amp;c</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Baxter&rsquo;s account of things in which he had changed his mind as he grew up. Voluminous. &mdash; No wonder. &mdash; If every man was to tell, or mark, on how many subjects he has changed, it would make vols. but the changes not always observed by man&rsquo;s self. &mdash; From pleasure to bus. [business] to quiet; from thoughtfulness to reflect. to piety; from dissipation to domestic. by impercept. gradat. but the change is certain. Dial <span class="t8">non progredi, progress. esse conspicimus</span>. Look back, consider what was thought at some dist. period.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;<span class="t8">Hope predom. in youth. Mind not willingly indulges unpleasing thoughts</span>. The world lies all enameled before him, as a distant prospect sun-gilt; inequalities only found by coming to it. <span class="t8">Love is to be all joy &mdash; children excellent</span> &mdash; Fame to be constant &mdash; caresses of the great &mdash; applauses of the learned &mdash; smiles of Beauty.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;<span class="t8">Fear of disgrace &mdash; bashfulness</span> &mdash; Finds things of less importance. Miscarriages forgot like excellencies; &mdash; if remembered, of no import. Danger of sinking into negligence of reputation. Lest the fear of disgrace destroy activity.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;<span class="t8">Confidence in himself</span>. Long tract of life before him. &mdash; No thought of sickness. &mdash; Embarrassment of affairs. &mdash; Distraction of family. Publick calamities. &mdash; No sense of the prevalence of bad habits. &mdash; Negligent of time &mdash; ready to undertake &mdash; careless to pursue &mdash; all changed by time.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;<span class="t8">Confident of others</span> &mdash; unsuspecting as unexperienced &mdash; imagining himself secure against neglect, never imagines they will venture to treat him ill. Ready to trust; expecting to be trusted. Convinced by time of the selfishness, the meanness, the cowardice, the treachery of men.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Youth ambitious, as thinking honours easy to be had.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Different kinds of praise pursued at different periods. Of the gay in youth, dang. hurt, &amp;c. despised.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Of the fancy in manhood. Ambit. &mdash; stocks &mdash; bargains. &mdash; Of the wise and sober in old age &mdash; seriousness &mdash; formality &mdash; maxims, but general &mdash; only of the rich, otherwise age is happy &mdash; but at last every thing referred to riches &mdash; no having fame, honour, influence, without subjection to caprice.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Horace.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Hard it would be if men entered life with the same views with which they leave it, or left as they enter it. &mdash; No hope &mdash; no undertaking &mdash; no regard to benevolence &mdash; no fear of disgrace, &amp;c.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Youth to be taught the piety of age &mdash; age to retain the honour of youth.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p26">This, it will be observed, is the sketch of Number 196 of the <span class="t8">Rambler</span>.<br/>I shall gratify my readers with another specimen:</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;<span class="t8">Confederacies difficult; why</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Seldom in war a match for single persons &mdash; nor in peace; therefore kings make themselves absolute. Confederacies in learning &mdash; every great work the work of one. <span class="t8">Bruy</span>. Scholar&rsquo;s friendship like ladies. Scribebamus, &amp;c. Mart. the apple of discord &mdash; the laurel of discord &mdash; the poverty of criticism. Swift&rsquo;s opinion of the power of six geniuses united. That union scarce possible. His remarks just; man a social, not steady nature. Drawn to man by words, repelled by passions. Orb drawn by attraction rep. [<span class="t8">repelled</span>] by centrifugal.</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;Common danger unites by crushing other passions &mdash; but they return.<br/>Equality hinders compliance. Superiority produces insolence and envy.<br/>Too much regard in each to private interest &mdash; too little.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The mischiefs of private and exclusive societies &mdash; the fitness of social attraction diffused through the whole. The mischiefs of too partial love of our country. Contraction of moral duties &mdash; [Greek: oi philoi on philos].</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Every man moves upon his own center, and therefore repels others from too near a contact, though he may comply with some general laws.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Of confederacy with superiours, every one knows the inconvenience. With equals, no authority; &mdash; every man his own opinion &mdash; his own interest.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Man and wife hardly united; &mdash; scarce ever without children. Computation, if two to one against two, how many against five? If confederacies were easy &mdash; useless; &mdash; many oppresses many. &mdash; If possible only to some, dangerous. <span class="t8">Principum amicitias</span>&rsquo;.</p>
<p class="p24">Here we see the embryo of Number 45 of the <span class="t8">Adventurer</span>; and it is a confirmation of what I shall presently have occasion to mention, that the papers in that collection marked T. were written by Johnson.</p>
<p class="p24">This scanty preparation of materials will not, however, much diminish our wonder at the extraordinary fertility of his mind; for the proportion which they bear to the number of essays which he wrote, is very small; and it is remarkable, that those for which he had made no preparation, are as rich and as highly finished as those for which the hints were lying by him. It is also to be observed, that the papers formed from his hints are worked up with such strength and elegance, that we almost lose sight of the hints, which become like &lsquo;drops in the bucket.&rsquo; Indeed, in several instances, he has made a very slender use of them, so that many of them remain still unapplied.</p>
<p class="p24">As the <span class="t8">Rambler</span> was entirely the work of one man, there was, of course, such a uniformity in its texture, as very much to exclude the charm of variety; and the grave and often solemn cast of thinking, which distinguished it from other periodical papers, made it, for some time, not generally liked. So slowly did this excellent work, of which twelve editions have now issued from the press, gain upon the world at large, that even in the closing number the authour says, &lsquo;I have never been much a favourite of the publick.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Yet, very soon after its commencement, there were who felt and acknowledged its uncommon excellence. Verses in its praise appeared in the newspapers; and the editor of the <span class="t8">Gentleman&rsquo;s Magazine</span> mentions, in October, his having received several letters to the same purpose from the learned. <span class="t8">The Student, or Oxford and Cambridge Miscellany</span>, in which Mr. Bonnell Thornton and Mr. Colman were the principal writers, describes it as &lsquo;a work that exceeds anything of the kind ever published in this kingdom, some of the <span class="t8">Spectators</span> excepted &mdash; if indeed they may be excepted.&rsquo; And afterwards, &lsquo;May the publick favours crown his merits, and may not the English, under the auspicious reign of GEORGE the Second, neglect a man, who, had he lived in the first century, would have been one of the greatest favourites of Augustus.&rsquo; This flattery of the monarch had no effect. It is too well known, that the second George never was an Augustus to learning or genius.</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson told me, with an amiable fondness, a little pleasing circumstance relative to this work. Mrs. Johnson, in whose judgement and taste he had great confidence, said to him, after a few numbers of the <span class="t8">Rambler</span> had come out, &lsquo;I thought very well of you before; but I did not imagine you could have written any thing equal to this.&rsquo; Distant praise, from whatever quarter, is not so delightful as that of a wife whom a man loves and esteems. Her approbation may be said to &lsquo;come home to his <span class="t8">bosom</span>;&rsquo; and being so near, its effect is most sensible and permanent.</p>
<p class="p24">Mr. James Elphinston, who has since published various works, and who was ever esteemed by Johnson as a worthy man, happened to be in Scotland while the <span class="t8">Rambler</span> was coming out in single papers at London. With a laudable zeal at once for the improvement of his countrymen, and the reputation of his friend, he suggested and took the charge of an edition of those Essays at Edinburgh, which followed progressively the London publication.</p>
<p class="p24">The following letter written at this time, though not dated, will show how much pleased Johnson was with this publication, and what kindness and regard he had for Mr. Elphinston.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To MR. JAMES ELPHINSTON.</p>
<p class="p24">[No date.]</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I cannot but confess the failures of my correspondence, but hope the same regard which you express for me on every other occasion, will incline you to forgive me. I am often, very often, ill; and, when I am well, am obliged to work: and, indeed, have never much used myself to punctuality. You are, however, not to make unkind inferences, when I forbear to reply to your kindness; for be assured, I never receive a letter from you without great pleasure, and a very warm sense of your generosity and friendship, which I heartily blame myself for not cultivating with more care. In this, as in many other cases, I go wrong, in opposition to conviction; for I think scarce any temporal good equally to be desired with the regard and familiarity of worthy men. I hope we shall be some time nearer to each other, and have a more ready way of pouring out our hearts.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am glad that you still find encouragement to proceed in your publication, and shall beg the favour of six more volumes to add to my former six, when you can, with any convenience, send them me. Please to present a set, in my name, to Mr. Ruddiman, of whom, I hear, that his learning is not his highest excellence. I have transcribed the mottos, and returned them, I hope not too late, of which I think many very happily performed. Mr. Cave has put the last in the magazine, in which I think he did well. I beg of you to write soon, and to write often, and to write long letters, which I hope in time to repay you; but you must be a patient creditor. I have, however, this of gratitude, that I think of you with regard, when I do not, perhaps, give the proofs which I ought, of being, Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your most obliged and</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Most humble servant.</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</span></p>
<p class="p21">This year he wrote to the same gentleman another letter, upon a mournful occasion,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To Mr. JAMES ELPHINSTON.</p>
<p class="p24">September 25, 1750.</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;You have, as I find by every kind of evidence, lost an excellent mother; and I hope you will not think me incapable of partaking of your grief. I have a mother, now eighty-two years of age, whom, therefore, I must soon lose, unless it please GOD that she rather should mourn for me. I read the letters in which you relate your mother&rsquo;s death to Mrs. Strahan, and think I do myself honour, when I tell you that I read them with tears; but tears are neither to <span class="t8">you</span> nor to <span class="t8">me</span> of any further use, when once the tribute of nature has been paid. The business of life summons us away from useless grief, and calls us to the exercise of those virtues of which we are lamenting our deprivation. The greatest benefit which one friend can confer upon another, is to guard, and excite, and elevate his virtues. This your mother will still perform, if you diligently preserve the memory of her life, and of her death: a life, so far as I can learn, useful, wise, and innocent; and a death resigned, peaceful, and holy. I cannot forbear to mention, that neither reason nor revelation denies you to hope, that you may increase her happiness by obeying her precepts; and that she may, in her present state, look with pleasure upon every act of virtue to which her instructions or example have contributed. Whether this be more than a pleasing dream, or a just opinion of separate spirits, is, indeed, of no great importance to us, when we consider ourselves as acting under the eye of GOD: yet, surely, there is something pleasing in the belief, that our separation from those whom we love is merely corporeal; and it may be a great incitement to virtuous friendship, if it can be made probable, that that union that has received the divine approbation shall continue to eternity.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;There is one expedient by which you may, in some degree, continue her presence. If you write down minutely what you remember of her from your earliest years, you will read it with great pleasure, and receive from it many hints of soothing recollection, when time shall remove her yet farther from you, and your grief shall be matured to veneration. To this, however painful for the present, I cannot but advise you, as to a source of comfort and satisfaction in the time to come; for all comfort and all satisfaction is sincerely wished you by, dear Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your most obliged, most obedient,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;And most humble servant,</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">The <span class="t8">Rambler</span> has increased in fame as in age. Soon after its first folio edition was concluded, it was published in six duodecimo volumes; and its authour lived to see ten numerous editions of it in London, beside those of Ireland and Scotland.</p>
<p class="p24">I profess myself to have ever entertained a profound veneration for the astonishing force and vivacity of mind which the <span class="t8">Rambler</span> exhibits. That Johnson had penetration enough to see, and seeing would not disguise the general misery of man in this state of being, may have given rise to the superficial notion of his being too stern a philosopher. But men of reflection will be sensible that he has given a true representation of human existence, and that he has, at the same time, with a generous benevolence displayed every consolation which our state affords us; not only those arising from the hopes of futurity, but such as may be attained in the immediate progress through life. He has not depressed the soul to despondency and indifference. He has every where inculcated study, labour, and exertion. Nay, he has shewn, in a very odious light, a man whose practice is to go about darkening the views of others, by perpetual complaints of evil, and awakening those considerations of danger and distress, which are, for the most part, lulled into a quiet oblivion. This he has done very strongly in his character of Suspirius, from which Goldsmith took that of Croaker, in his comedy of <span class="t8">The Good-Natured Man</span>, as Johnson told me he acknowledged to him, and which is, indeed, very obvious.</p>
<p class="p24">To point out the numerous subjects which the <span class="t8">Rambler</span> treats, with a dignity and perspicuity which are there united in a manner which we shall in vain look for any where else, would take up too large a portion of my book, and would, I trust, be superfluous, considering how universally those volumes are now disseminated. Even the most condensed and brilliant sentences which they contain, and which have very properly been selected under the name of <span class="t8">Beauties</span>, are of considerable bulk. But I may shortly observe, that the <span class="t8">Rambler</span> furnishes such an assemblage of discourses on practical religion and moral duty, of critical investigations, and allegorical and oriental tales, that no mind can be thought very deficient that has, by constant study and meditation, assimilated to itself all that may be found there. No. 7, written in Passion-week on abstraction and self-examination, and No. 110, on penitence and the placability of the Divine Nature, cannot be too often read. No. 54, on the effect which the death of a friend should have upon us, though rather too dispiriting, may be occasionally very medicinal to the mind. Every one must suppose the writer to have been deeply impressed by a real scene; but he told me that was not the case; which shews how well his fancy could conduct him to the &lsquo;house of mourning.&rsquo; Some of these more solemn papers, I doubt not, particularly attracted the notice of Dr. Young, the authour of <span class="t8">The Night Thoughts</span>, of whom my estimation is such, as to reckon his applause an honour even to Johnson. I have seen some volumes of Dr. Young&rsquo;s copy of the <span class="t8">Rambler</span>, in which he has marked the passages which he thought particularly excellent, by folding down a corner of the page; and such as he rated in a super-eminent degree, are marked by double folds. I am sorry that some of the volumes are lost. Johnson was pleased when told of the minute attention with which Young had signified his approbation of his Essays.</p>
<p class="p24">I will venture to say, that in no writings whatever can be found <span class="t8">more bark and steel for the mind</span>, if I may use the expression; more that can brace and invigorate every manly and noble sentiment. No. 32 on patience, even under extreme misery, is wonderfully lofty, and as much above the rant of stoicism, as the Sun of Revelation is brighter than the twilight of Pagan philosophy. I never read the following sentence without feeling my frame thrill: &lsquo;I think there is some reason for questioning whether the body and mind are not so proportioned, that the one can bear all which can be inflicted on the other; whether virtue cannot stand its ground as long as life, and whether a soul well principled, will not be sooner separated than subdued.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Though instruction be the predominant purpose of the <span class="t8">Rambler</span>, yet it is enlivened with a considerable portion of amusement. Nothing can be more erroneous than the notion which some persons have entertained, that Johnson was then a retired authour, ignorant of the world; and, of consequence, that he wrote only from his imagination when he described characters and manners. He said to me, that before he wrote that work, he had been &lsquo;running about the world,&rsquo; as he expressed it, more than almost any body; and I have heard him relate, with much satisfaction, that several of the characters in the <span class="t8">Rambler</span> were drawn so naturally, that when it first circulated in numbers, a club in one of the towns in Essex imagined themselves to be severally exhibited in it, and were much incensed against a person who, they suspected, had thus made them objects of publick notice; nor were they quieted till authentick assurance was given them, that the <span class="t8">Rambler</span> was written by a person who had never heard of any one of them. Some of the characters are believed to have been actually drawn from the life, particularly that of Prospero from Garrick, who never entirely forgave its pointed satire. For instances of fertility of fancy, and accurate description of real life, I appeal to No. 19, a man who wanders from one profession to another, with most plausible reasons for every change. No. 34, female fastidiousness and timorous refinement. No. 82, a Virtuoso who has collected curiosities. No. 88, petty modes of entertaining a company, and conciliating kindness. No. 182, fortune-hunting. No. 194-195, a tutor&rsquo;s account of the follies of his pupil. No. 197-198, legacy-hunting. He has given a specimen of his nice observation of the mere external appearances of life, in the following passage in No. 179, against affectation, that frequent and most disgusting quality: &lsquo;He that stands to contemplate the crouds that fill the streets of a populous city, will see many passengers whose air and motion it will be difficult to behold without contempt and laughter; but if he examine what are the appearances that thus powerfully excite his risibility, he will find among them neither poverty nor disease, nor any involuntary or painful defect. The disposition to derision and insult, is awakened by the softness of foppery, the swell of insolence, the liveliness of levity, or the solemnity of grandeur; by the sprightly trip, the stately stalk, the formal strut, and the lofty mien; by gestures intended to catch the eye, and by looks elaborately formed as evidences of importance.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Every page of the <span class="t8">Rambler</span> shews a mind teeming with classical allusion and poetical imagery: illustrations from other writers are, upon all occasions, so ready, and mingle so easily in his periods, that the whole appears of one uniform vivid texture.</p>
<p class="p24">The style of this work has been censured by some shallow criticks as involved and turgid, and abounding with antiquated and hard words. So ill-founded is the first part of this objection, that I will challenge all who may honour this book with a perusal, to point out any English writer whose language conveys his meaning with equal force and perspicuity. It must, indeed, be allowed, that the structure of his sentences is expanded, and often has somewhat of the inversion of Latin; and that he delighted to express familiar thoughts in philosophical language; being in this the reverse of Socrates, who, it was said, reduced philosophy to the simplicity of common life. But let us attend to what he himself says in his concluding paper: &lsquo;When common words were less pleasing to the ear, or less distinct in their signification, I have familiarised the terms of philosophy, by applying them to popular ideas.&rsquo; And, as to the second part of this objection, upon a late careful revision of the work, I can with confidence say, that it is amazing how few of those words, for which it has been unjustly characterised, are actually to be found in it; I am sure, not the proportion of one to each paper. This idle charge has been echoed from one babbler to another, who have confounded Johnson&rsquo;s Essays with Johnson&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Dictionary</span>; and because he thought it right in a Lexicon of our language to collect many words which had fallen into disuse, but were supported by great authorities, it has been imagined that all of these have been interwoven into his own compositions. That some of them have been adopted by him unnecessarily, may, perhaps, be allowed; but, in general they are evidently an advantage, for without them his stately ideas would be confined and cramped. &lsquo;He that thinks with more extent than another, will want words of larger meaning.&rsquo; He once told me, that he had formed his style upon that of Sir William Temple, and upon Chambers&rsquo;s Proposal for his <span class="t8">Dictionary</span>. He certainly was mistaken; or if he imagined at first that he was imitating Temple, he was very unsuccessful; for nothing can be more unlike than the simplicity of Temple, and the richness of Johnson. Their styles differ as plain cloth and brocade. Temple, indeed, seems equally erroneous in supposing that he himself had formed his style upon Sandys&rsquo;s <span class="t8">View of the State of Religion in the Western parts of the World</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">The style of Johnson was, undoubtedly, much formed upon that of the great writers in the last century, Hooker, Bacon, Sanderson, Hakewell, and others; those &lsquo;GIANTS,&rsquo; as they were well characterised by A GREAT PERSONAGE, whose authority, were I to name him, would stamp a reverence on the opinion.</p>
<p class="p24">We may, with the utmost propriety, apply to his learned style that passage of Horace, a part of which he has taken as the motto to his <span class="t8">Dictionary</span>:</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;Cum tabulis animum censoris sumet honesti;<br/>Audebit quaecumque parùm splendoris habebunt<br/>Et sine pondere erunt, et honore indigna ferentur,<br/>Verba movere loco, quamvis invita recedant,<br/>Et versentur adhuc intra penetralia Vesta.<br/>Obscurata diu populo bonus eruet, atque<br/>Proferet in lucem speciosa vocabula rerum,<br/>Quae priscis memorala Calonibus alque Cethegis,<br/>Nunc situs informis premit et deserta velustas:<br/>Adsciscet nova, quae genitor produxerit usus:<br/>Vehemens, et liquidus, puroque simillimus amni,<br/>Fundet opes Latiumque beabit divile linguá.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">To so great a master of thinking, to one of such vast and various knowledge as Johnson, might have been allowed a liberal indulgence of that licence which Horace claims in another place:</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;Si forté necesse est<br/>Indiciis monstrare recentibus abdita rerum,<br/>Fingere cinctutis non exaudita Cethegis<br/>Continget, dabiturque licentia sumpta pudenter:<br/>Et nova fictaque nuper habebunt verba fidem si<br/>Græco fonte cadant, parce detorta. Quid autem<br/>Cæcilio Plautoque dabit Romanus, ademptum<br/>Virgilio Varioque? Ego cur, acquirere pauca<br/>Si possum, invideor; cum lingua Catonis et Enni<br/>Sermonem patrium ditaverit, et nova rerum<br/>Nomina protulerit? Licuit semperque licebit<br/>Signatum præsente notá producere nomen.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Yet Johnson assured me, that he had not taken upon him to add more than four or five words to the English language, of his own formation; and he was very much offended at the general licence, by no means &lsquo;modestly taken&rsquo; in his time, not only to coin new words, but to use many words in senses quite different from their established meaning, and those frequently very fantastical.</p>
<p class="p24">Sir Thomas Brown, whose life Johnson wrote, was remarkably fond of Anglo-Latian diction; and to his example we are to ascribe Johnson&rsquo;s sometimes indulging himself in this kind of phraseology&rsquo;. Johnson&rsquo;s comprehension of mind was the mould for his language. Had his conceptions been narrower, his expression would have been easier. His sentences have a dignified march; and, it is certain, that his example has given a general elevation to the language of his country, for many of our best writers have approached very near to him; and, from the influence which he has had upon our composition, scarcely any thing is written now that is not better expressed than was usual before he appeared to lead the national taste.</p>
<p class="p24">This circumstance, the truth of which must strike every critical reader, has been so happily enforced by Mr. Courtenay, in his <span class="t8">Moral and Literary Character of Dr. Johnson</span>, that I cannot prevail on myself to withhold it, notwithstanding his, perhaps, too great partiality for one of his friends:</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;By nature&rsquo;s gifts ordain&rsquo;d mankind to rule,<br/>He, like a Titian, form&rsquo;d his brilliant school;<br/>And taught congenial spirits to excel,<br/>While from his lips impressive wisdom fell.<br/>Our boasted GOLDSMITH felt the sovereign sway:<br/>From him deriv&rsquo;d the sweet, yet nervous lay.<br/>To Fame&rsquo;s proud cliff he bade our Raphael rise;<br/>Hence REYNOLDS&rsquo; pen with REYNOLDS&rsquo; pencil vies.<br/>With Johnson&rsquo;s flame melodious BURNEY glows,<br/>While the grand strain in smoother cadence flows.<br/>And you, MALONE, to critick learning dear.<br/>Correct and elegant, refin&rsquo;d though clear,<br/>By studying him, acquir&rsquo;d that classick taste,<br/>Which high in Shakspeare&rsquo;s fane thy statue plac&rsquo;d.<br/>Near Johnson STEEVENS stands, on scenick ground,<br/>Acute, laborious, fertile, and profound.<br/>Ingenious HAWKESWORTH to this school we owe.<br/>And scarce the pupil from the tutor know.<br/>Here early parts accomplish&rsquo;d JONES sublimes,<br/>And science blends with Asia&rsquo;s lofty rhymes:<br/>Harmonious JONES! who in his splendid strains<br/>Sings Camdeo&rsquo;s sports, on Agra&rsquo;s flowery plains:<br/>In Hindu fictions while we fondly trace<br/>Love and the Muses, deck&rsquo;d with Attick grace.<br/>Amid these names can BOSWELL be forgot,<br/>Scarce by North Britons now esteem&rsquo;d a Scot?<br/>Who to the sage devoted from his youth,<br/>Imbib&rsquo;d from him the sacred love of truth;<br/>The keen research, the exercise of mind,<br/>And that best art, the art to know mankind. &mdash; <br/>Nor was his energy confin&rsquo;d alone<br/>To friends around his philosophick throne;<br/><span class="t8">Its influence wide improv&rsquo;d our letter&rsquo;d isle.<br/>And lucid vigour marked the general style</span>:<br/>As Nile&rsquo;s proud waves, swoln from their oozy bed.<br/>First o&rsquo;er the neighbouring meads majestick spread;<br/>Till gathering force, they more and more expand.<br/>And with new virtue fertilise the land.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson&rsquo;s language, however, must be allowed to be too masculine for the delicate gentleness of female writing. His ladies, therefore, seem strangely formal, even to ridicule; and are well denominated by the names which he has given them as Misella, Zozima, Properantia, Rhodoclia.</p>
<p class="p24">It has of late been the fashion to compare the style of Addison and Johnson, and to depreciate, I think very unjustly, the style of Addison as nerveless and feeble, because it has not the strength and energy of that of Johnson. Their prose may be balanced like the poetry of Dryden and Pope. Both are excellent, though in different ways. Addison writes with the ease of a gentleman. His readers fancy that a wise and accomplished companion is talking to them; so that he insinuates his sentiments and taste into their minds by an imperceptible influence. Johnson writes like a teacher. He dictates to his readers as if from an academical chair. They attend with awe and admiration; and his precepts are impressed upon them by his commanding eloquence. Addison&rsquo;s style, like a light wine, pleases everybody from the first. Johnson&rsquo;s, like a liquor of more body, seems too strong at first, but, by degrees, is highly relished; and such is the melody of his periods, so much do they captivate the ear, and seize upon the attention, that there is scarcely any writer, however inconsiderable, who does not aim, in some degree, at the same species of excellence. But let us not ungratefully undervalue that beautiful style, which has pleasingly conveyed to us much instruction and entertainment. Though comparatively weak, opposed to Johnson&rsquo;s Herculean vigour, let us not call it positively feeble. Let us remember the character of his style, as given by Johnson himself: &lsquo;What he attempted, he performed; he is never feeble, and he did not wish to be energetick; he is never rapid, and he never stagnates. His sentences have neither studied amplitude, nor affected brevity: his periods, though not diligently rounded, are voluble and easy. Whoever wishes to attain an English style, familiar but not coarse, and elegant but not ostentatious, must give his days and nights to the volumes of Addison.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Though the <span class="t8">Rambler</span> was not concluded till the year 1752, I shall, under this year, say all that I have to observe upon it. Some of the translations of the mottos by himself are admirably done. He acknowledges to have received &lsquo;elegant translations&rsquo; of many of them from Mr. James Elphinston; and some are very happily translated by a Mr. <span class="t8">F. Lewis</span>, of whom I never heard more, except that Johnson thus described him to Mr. Malone: &lsquo;Sir, he lived in London, and hung loose upon society.&rsquo; The concluding paper of his <span class="t8">Rambler</span> is at once dignified and pathetick. I cannot, however, but wish that he had not ended it with an unnecessary Greek verse, translated also into an English couplet. It is too much like the conceit of those dramatick poets, who used to conclude each act with a rhyme; and the expression in the first line of his couplet, &lsquo;<span class="t8">Celestial powers</span>&rsquo;, though proper in Pagan poetry, is ill suited to Christianity, with &lsquo;a conformity&rsquo; to which he consoles himself. How much better would it have been, to have ended with the prose sentence &lsquo;I shall never envy the honours which wit and learning obtain in any other cause, if I can be numbered among the writers who have given ardour to virtue, and confidence to truth.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">His friend, Dr. Birch, being now engaged in preparing an edition of Ralegh&rsquo;s smaller pieces, Dr. Johnson wrote the following letter to that gentleman:</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To DR. BIRCH.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Gough-square, May 12, 1750.</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Knowing that you are now preparing to favour the publick with a new edition of Ralegh&rsquo;s miscellaneous pieces, I have taken the liberty to send you a Manuscript, which fell by chance within my notice. I perceive no proofs of forgery in my examination of it; and the owner tells me, that as <span class="t8">he</span> has heard, the handwriting is Sir Walter&rsquo;s. If you should find reason to conclude it genuine, it will be a kindness to the owner, a blind person, to recommend it to the booksellers. I am, Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your most humble servant,</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">His just abhorrence of Milton&rsquo;s political notions was ever strong. But this did not prevent his warm admiration of Milton&rsquo;s great poetical merit, to which he has done illustrious justice, beyond all who have written upon the subject. And this year he not only wrote a Prologue, which was spoken by Mr. Garrick before the acting of <span class="t8">Comus</span> at Drury-lane theatre, for the benefit of Milton&rsquo;s grand-daughter, but took a very zealous interest in the success of the charity. On the day preceding the performance, he published the following letter in the &lsquo;General Advertiser,&rsquo; addressed to the printer of that paper:</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;That a certain degree of reputation is acquired merely by approving the works of genius, and testifying a regard to the memory of authours, is a truth too evident to be denied; and therefore to ensure a participation of fame with a celebrated poet, many who would, perhaps, have contributed to starve him when alive, have heaped expensive pageants upon his grave.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;It must, indeed, be confessed, that this method of becoming known to posterity with honour, is peculiar to the great, or at least to the wealthy; but an opportunity now offers for almost every individual to secure the praise of paying a just regard to the illustrious dead, united with the pleasure of doing good to the living. To assist industrious indigence, struggling with distress and debilitated by age, is a display of virtue, and an acquisition of happiness and honour.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Whoever, then, would be thought capable of pleasure in reading the works of our incomparable Milton, and not so destitute of gratitude as to refuse to lay out a trifle in rational and elegant entertainment, for the benefit of his living remains, for the exercise of their own virtue, the increase of their reputation, and the pleasing consciousness of doing good, should appear at Drury-lane theatre to-morrow, April 5, when <span class="t8">Comus</span> will be performed for the benefit of Mrs. Elizabeth Foster, grand-daughter to the author, and the only surviving branch of his family.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;N.B. There will be a new prologue on the occasion, written by the author of Irene, and spoken by Mr. Garrick; and, by particular desire, there will be added to the Masque a dramatick satire, called <span class="t8">Lethe</span>, in which Mr. Garrick will perform.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">1751: ÆTAT. 42. &mdash; In 1751 we are to consider him as carrying on both his <span class="t8">Dictionary</span> and <span class="t8">Rambler</span>. But he also wrote <span class="t8">The Life of Cheynel</span>,[*] in the miscellany called <span class="t8">The Student</span>; and the Reverend Dr. Douglas having, with uncommon acuteness, clearly detected a gross forgery and imposition upon the publick by William Lauder, a Scotch schoolmaster, who had, with equal impudence and ingenuity, represented Milton as a plagiary from certain modern Latin poets, Johnson, who had been so far imposed upon as to furnish a Preface and Postscript to his work, now dictated a letter for Lauder, addressed to Dr. Douglas, acknowledging his fraud in terms of suitable contrition.</p>
<p class="p24">This extraordinary attempt of Lauder was no sudden effort. He had brooded over it for many years: and to this hour it is uncertain what his principal motive was, unless it were a vain notion of his superiority, in being able, by whatever means, to deceive mankind. To effect this, he produced certain passages from Grotius, Masenius, and others, which had a faint resemblance to some parts of the <span class="t8">Paradise Lost</span>. In these he interpolated some fragments of Hog&rsquo;s Latin translation of that poem, alledging that the mass thus fabricated was the archetype from which Milton copied. These fabrications he published from time to time in the <span class="t8">Gentleman s Magazine</span>; and, exulting in his fancied success, he in 1750 ventured to collect them into a pamphlet, entitled <span class="t8">An Essay on Milton&rsquo;s Use and Imitation of the Moderns in his Paradise Lost</span>. To this pamphlet Johnson wrote a Preface, in full persuasion of Lauder&rsquo;s honesty, and a Postscript recommending, in the most persuasive terms, a subscription for the relief of a grand-daughter of Milton, of whom he thus speaks:</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;It is yet in the power of a great people to reward the poet whose name they boast, and from their alliance to whose genius, they claim some kind of superiority to every other nation of the earth; that poet, whose works may possibly be read when every other monument of British greatness shall be obliterated; to reward him, not with pictures or with medals, which, if he sees, he sees with contempt, but with tokens of gratitude, which he, perhaps, may even now consider as not unworthy the regard of an immortal spirit.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p26">Surely this is inconsistent with &lsquo;enmity towards Milton,&rsquo; which Sir John<br/>Hawkins imputes to Johnson upon this occasion, adding,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I could all along observe that Johnson seemed to approve not only of the design, but of the argument; and seemed to exult in a persuasion, that the reputation of Milton was likely to suffer by this discovery. That he was not privy to the imposture, I am well persuaded; but that he wished well to the argument, may be inferred from the Preface, which indubitably was written by Johnson.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Is it possible for any man of clear judgement to suppose that Johnson, who so nobly praised the poetical excellence of Milton in a Postscript to this very &lsquo;discovery,&rsquo; as he then supposed it, could, at the same time, exult in a persuasion that the great poet&rsquo;s reputation was likely to suffer by it? This is an inconsistency of which Johnson was incapable; nor can any thing more be fairly inferred from the Preface, than that Johnson, who was alike distinguished for ardent curiosity and love of truth, was pleased with an investigation by which both were gratified. That he was actuated by these motives, and certainly by no unworthy desire to depreciate our great epick poet, is evident from his own words; for, after mentioning the general zeal of men of genius and literature &lsquo;to advance the honour, and distinguish the beauties of <span class="t8">Paradise Lost</span>&rsquo;, he says,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Among the inquiries to which this ardour of criticism has naturally given occasion, none is more obscure in itself, or more worthy of rational curiosity, than a retrospect of the progress of this mighty genius in the construction of his work; a view of the fabrick gradually rising, perhaps, from small beginnings, till its foundation rests in the centre, and its turrets sparkle in the skies; to trace back the structure through all its varieties, to the simplicity of its first plan; to find what was first projected, whence the scheme was taken, how it was improved, by what assistance it was executed, and from what stores the materials were collected; whether its founder dug them from the quarries of Nature, or demolished other buildings to embellish his own.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p26">Is this the language of one who wished to blast the laurels of<br/>Milton?</p>
<p class="p24">Though Johnson&rsquo;s circumstances were at this time far from being easy, his humane and charitable disposition was constantly exerting itself. Mrs. Anna Williams, daughter of a very ingenious Welsh physician, and a woman of more than ordinary talents and literature, having come to London in hopes of being cured of a cataract in both her eyes, which afterwards ended in total blindness, was kindly received as a constant visitor at his house while Mrs. Johnson lived; and after her death, having come under his roof in order to have an operation upon her eyes performed with more comfort to her than in lodgings, she had an apartment from him during the rest of her life, at all times when he had a house.</p>
<p class="p24">1752: ÆTAT. 43. &mdash; In 1752 he was almost entirely occupied with his <span class="t8">Dictionary</span>. The last paper of his <span class="t8">Rambler</span> was published March 2, this year; after which, there was a cessation for some time of any exertion of his talents as an essayist. But, in the same year, Dr. Hawkesworth, who was his warm admirer, and a studious imitator of his style, and then lived in great intimacy with him, began a periodical paper, entitled <span class="t8">The Adventurer</span>, in connection with other gentlemen, one of whom was Johnson&rsquo;s much-loved friend, Dr. Bathurst; and, without doubt, they received many valuable hints from his conversation, most of his friends having been so assisted in the course of their works.</p>
<p class="p24">That there should be a suspension of his literary labours during a part of the year 1752, will not seem strange, when it is considered that soon after closing his <span class="t8">Rambler</span>, he suffered a loss which, there can be no doubt, affected him with the deepest distress. For on the 17th of March, O.S., his wife died. Why Sir John Hawkins should unwarrantably take upon him even to <span class="t8">suppose</span> that Johnson&rsquo;s fondness for her was <span class="t8">dissembled</span> (meaning simulated or assumed,) and to assert, that if it was not the case, &lsquo;it was a lesson he had learned by rote,&rsquo; I cannot conceive; unless it proceeded from a want of similar feelings in his own breast. To argue from her being much older than Johnson, or any other circumstances, that he could not really love her, is absurd; for love is not a subject of reasoning, but of feeling, and therefore there are no common principles upon which one can persuade another concerning it. Every man feels for himself, and knows how he is affected by particular qualities in the person he admires, the impressions of which are too minute and delicate to be substantiated in language.</p>
<p class="p24">The following very solemn and affecting prayer was found after Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s decease, by his servant, Mr. Francis Barber, who delivered it to my worthy friend the Reverend Mr. Strahan, Vicar of Islington, who at my earnest request has obligingly favoured me with a copy of it, which he and I compared with the original. I present it to the world as an undoubted proof of a circumstance in the character of my illustrious friend, which though some whose hard minds I never shall envy, may attack as superstitious, will I am sure endear him more to numbers of good men. I have an additional, and that a personal motive for presenting it, because it sanctions what I myself have always maintained and am fond to indulge.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;April 26, 1752, being after 12 at Night of the 25th.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;O Lord! Governour of heaven and earth, in whose hands are embodied and departed Spirits, if thou hast ordained the Souls of the Dead to minister to the Living, and appointed my departed Wife to have care of me, grant that I may enjoy the good effects of her attention and ministration, whether exercised by appearance, impulses, dreams or in any other manner agreeable to thy Government. Forgive my presumption, enlighten my ignorance, and however meaner agents are employed, grant me the blessed influences of thy holy Spirit, through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">What actually followed upon this most interesting piece of devotion by Johnson, we are not informed; but I, whom it has pleased GOD to afflict in a similar manner to that which occasioned it, have certain experience of benignant communication by dreams.</p>
<p class="p24">That his love for his wife was of the most ardent kind, and, during the long period of fifty years, was unimpaired by the lapse of time, is evident from various passages in the series of his <span class="t8">Prayers and Meditations</span>, published by the Reverend Mr. Strahan, as well as from other memorials, two of which I select, as strongly marking the tenderness and sensibility of his mind.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;March 28, 1753. I kept this day as the anniversary of my Tetty&rsquo;s death, with prayer and tears in the morning. In the evening I prayed for her conditionally, if it were lawful.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;April 23, 1753. I know not whether I do not too much indulge the vain longings of affection; but I hope they intenerate my heart, and that when I die like my Tetty, this affection will be acknowledged in a happy interview, and that in the mean time I am incited by it to piety. I will, however, not deviate too much from common and received methods of devotion.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Her wedding-ring, when she became his wife, was, after her death, preserved by him, as long as he lived, with an affectionate care, in a little round wooden box, in the inside of which he pasted a slip of paper, thus inscribed by him in fair characters, as follows:</p>
<p class="p26">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rsquo;Eheu!<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eliz. Johnson,<br/>Nupta Jul. 9° 1736,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mortua, eheu!<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mart. 17° 1752.</p>
<p class="p24">After his death, Mr. Francis Barber, his faithful servant and residuary legatee, offered this memorial of tenderness to Mrs. Lucy Porter, Mrs. Johnson&rsquo;s daughter; but she having declined to accept of it, he had it enamelled as a mourning ring for his old master, and presented it to his wife, Mrs. Barber, who now has it.</p>
<p class="p24">The state of mind in which a man must be upon the death of a woman whom he sincerely loves, had been in his contemplation many years before. In his <span class="t8">Irene</span>, we find the following fervent and tender speech of Demetrius, addressed to his Aspasia:</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;From those bright regions of eternal day,<br/>Where now thou shin&rsquo;st amongst thy fellow saints,<br/>Array&rsquo;d in purer light, look down on me!<br/>In pleasing visions and delusive dreams,<br/>O! sooth my soul, and teach me how to lose thee.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I have, indeed, been told by Mrs. Desmoulins, who, before her marriage, lived for some time with Mrs. Johnson at Hampstead, that she indulged herself in country air and nice living, at an unsuitable expense, while her husband was drudging in the smoke of London, and that she by no means treated him with that complacency which is the most engaging quality in a wife. But all this is perfectly compatible with his fondness for her, especially when it is remembered that he had a high opinion of her understanding, and that the impressions which her beauty, real or imaginary, had originally made upon his fancy, being continued by habit, had not been effaced, though she herself was doubtless much altered for the worse. The dreadful shock of separation took place in the night; and he immediately dispatched a letter to his friend, the Reverend Dr. Taylor, which, as Taylor told me, expressed grief in the strongest manner he had ever read; so that it is much to be regretted it has not been preserved. The letter was brought to Dr. Taylor, at his house in the Cloisters, Westminster, about three in the morning; and as it signified an earnest desire to see him, he got up, and went to Johnson as soon as he was dressed, and found him in tears and in extreme agitation. After being a little while together, Johnson requested him to join with him in prayer. He then prayed extempore, as did Dr. Taylor; and thus, by means of that piety which was ever his primary object, his troubled mind was, in some degree, soothed and composed.</p>
<p class="p24">The next day he wrote as follows:</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To The Revernd Dr. Taylor.</p>
<p class="p24">Dear Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Let me have your company and instruction. Do not live away from me. My distress is great.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Pray desire Mrs. Taylor to inform me what mourning I should buy for my mother and Miss Porter, and bring a note in writing with you.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Remember me in your prayers, for vain is the help of man.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am, dear Sir, &amp;c.</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;March 18, 1752.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">That his sufferings upon the death of his wife were severe, beyond what are commonly endured, I have no doubt, from the information of many who were then about him, to none of whom I give more credit than to Mr. Francis Barber, his faithful negro servant, who came into his family about a fortnight after the dismal event. These sufferings were aggravated by the melancholy inherent in his constitution; and although he probably was not oftener in the wrong than she was, in the little disagreements which sometimes troubled his married state, during which, he owned to me, that the gloomy irritability of his existence was more painful to him than ever, he might very naturally, after her death, be tenderly disposed to charge himself with slight omissions and offences, the sense of which would give him much uneasiness. Accordingly we find, about a year after her decease, that he thus addressed the Supreme Being: &lsquo;O LORD, who givest the grace of repentance, and hearest the prayers of the penitent, grant that by true contrition I may obtain forgiveness of all the sins committed, and of all duties neglected in my union with the wife whom thou hast taken from me; for the neglect of joint devotion, patient exhortation, and mild instruction.&rsquo; The kindness of his heart, notwithstanding the impetuosity of his temper, is well known to his friends; and I cannot trace the smallest foundation for the following dark and uncharitable assertion by Sir John Hawkins: &lsquo;The apparition of his departed wife was altogether of the terrifick kind, and hardly afforded him a hope that she was in a state of happiness.&rsquo; That he, in conformity with the opinion of many of the most able, learned, and pious Christians in all ages, supposed that there was a middle state after death, previous to the time at which departed souls are finally received to eternal felicity, appears, I think, unquestionably from his devotions: &lsquo;And, O LORD, so far as it may be lawful in me, I commend to thy fatherly goodness <span class="t8">the soul of my departed wife</span>; beseeching thee to grant her whatever is best in her <span class="t8">present state</span>, and <span class="t8">finally to receive her to eternal happiness</span>.&rsquo; But this state has not been looked upon with horrour, but only as less gracious.</p>
<p class="p24">He deposited the remains of Mrs. Johnson in the church of Bromley, in Kent, to which he was probably led by the residence of his friend Hawkesworth at that place. The funeral sermon which he composed for her, which was never preached, but having been given to Dr. Taylor, has been published since his death, is a performance of uncommon excellence, and full of rational and pious comfort to such as are depressed by that severe affliction which Johnson felt when he wrote it. When it is considered that it was written in such an agitation of mind, and in the short interval between her death and burial, it cannot be read without wonder.</p>
<p class="p24">From Mr. Francis Barber I have had the following authentick and artless account of the situation in which he found him recently after his wife&rsquo;s death:</p>
<p class="p24">He was in great affliction. Mrs. Williams was then living in his house, which was in Gough-square. He was busy with the Dictionary. Mr. Shiels, and some others of the gentlemen who had formerly written for him, used to come about him. He had then little for himself, but frequently sent money to Mr. Shiels when in distress. The friends who visited him at that time, were chiefly Dr. Bathurst, and Mr. Diamond, an apothecary in Cork-street, Burlington-gardens, with whom he and Mrs. Williams generally dined every Sunday. There was a talk of his going to Iceland with him, which would probably have happened had he lived. There were also Mr. Cave, Dr. Hawkesworth, Mr. Ryland, merchant on Tower Hill, Mrs. Masters, the poetess, who lived with Mr. Cave, Mrs. Carter, and sometimes Mrs. Macaulay, also Mrs. Gardiner, wife of a tallow-chandler on Snow-hill, not in the learned way, but a worthy good woman; Mr. (now Sir Joshua) Reynolds; Mr. Millar, Mr. Dodsley, Mr. Bouquet, Mr. Payne of Paternoster-row, booksellers; Mr. Strahan, the printer; the Earl of Orrery, Lord Southwell, Mr. Garrick.</p>
<p class="p24">Many are, no doubt, omitted in this catalogue of his friends, and, in particular, his humble friend Mr. Robert Levet, an obscure practiser in physick amongst the lower people, his fees being sometimes very small sums, sometimes whatever provisions his patients could afford him; but of such extensive practice in that way, that Mrs. Williams has told me, his walk was from Hounsditch to Marybone. It appears from Johnson&rsquo;s diary that their acquaintance commenced about the year 1746; and such was Johnson&rsquo;s predilection for him, and fanciful estimation of his moderate abilities, that I have heard him say he should not be satisfied, though attended by all the College of Physicians, unless he had Mr. Levet with him. Ever since I was acquainted with Dr. Johnson, and many years before, as I have been assured by those who knew him earlier, Mr. Levet had an apartment in his house, or his chambers, and waited upon him every morning, through the whole course of his late and tedious breakfast. He was of a strange grotesque appearance, stiff and formal in his manner, and seldom said a word while any company was present.</p>
<p class="p24">The circle of his friends, indeed, at this time was extensive and various, far beyond what has been generally imagined. To trace his acquaintance with each particular person, if it could be done, would be a task, of which the labour would not be repaid by the advantage. But exceptions are to be made; one of which must be a friend so eminent as Sir Joshua Reynolds, who was truly his <span class="t8">dulce decus</span>, and with whom he maintained an uninterrupted intimacy to the last hour of his life. When Johnson lived in Castle-street, Cavendish-square, he used frequently to visit two ladies, who lived opposite to him, Miss Cotterells, daughters of Admiral Cotterell. Reynolds used also to visit there, and thus they met. Mr. Reynolds, as I have observed above, had, from the first reading of his <span class="t8">Life of Savage</span>, conceived a very high admiration of Johnson&rsquo;s powers of writing. His conversation no less delighted him; and he cultivated his acquaintance with the laudable zeal of one who was ambitious of general improvement. Sir Joshua, indeed, was lucky enough at their very first meeting to make a remark, which was so much above the common-place style of conversation, that Johnson at once perceived that Reynolds had the habit of thinking for himself. The ladies were regretting the death of a friend, to whom they owed great obligations; upon which Reynolds observed, &lsquo;You have, however, the comfort of being relieved from a burthen of gratitude.&rsquo; They were shocked a little at this alleviating suggestion, as too selfish; but Johnson defended it in his clear and forcible manner, and was much pleased with the <span class="t8">mind</span>, the fair view of human nature, which it exhibited, like some of the reflections of Rochefaucault. The consequence was, that he went home with Reynolds, and supped with him.</p>
<p class="p24">Sir Joshua told me a pleasant characteristical anecdote of Johnson about the time of their first acquaintance. When they were one evening together at the Miss Cotterells&rsquo;, the then Duchess of Argyle and another lady of high rank came in. Johnson thinking that the Miss Cotterells were too much engrossed by them, and that he and his friend were neglected, as low company of whom they were somewhat ashamed, grew angry; and resolving to shock their supposed pride, by making their great visitors imagine that his friend and he were low indeed, he addressed himself in a loud tone to Mr. Reynolds, saying, &lsquo;How much do you think you and I could get in a week, if we were to <span class="t8">work as hard</span> as we could?&rsquo; &mdash; as if they had been common mechanicks.</p>
<p class="p24">His acquaintance with Bennet Langton, Esq. of Langton, in Lincolnshire, another much valued friend, commenced soon after the conclusion of his <span class="t8">Rambler</span>; which that gentleman, then a youth, had read with so much admiration, that he came to London chiefly with the view of endeavouring to be introduced to its authour. By a fortunate chance he happened to take lodgings in a house where Mr. Levet frequently visited; and having mentioned his wish to his landlady, she introduced him to Mr. Levet, who readily obtained Johnson&rsquo;s permission to bring Mr. Langton to him; as, indeed, Johnson, during the whole course of his life, had no shyness, real or affected, but was easy of access to all who were properly recommended, and even wished to see numbers at his <span class="t8">levee</span>, as his morning circle of company might, with strict propriety, be called. Mr. Langton was exceedingly surprised when the sage first appeared. He had not received the smallest intimation of his figure, dress, or manner. From perusing his writings, he fancied he should see a decent, well-drest, in short, a remarkably decorous philosopher. Instead of which, down from his bedchamber, about noon, came, as newly risen, a huge uncouth figure, with a little dark wig which scarcely covered his head, and his clothes hanging loose about him. But his conversation was so rich, so animated, and so forcible, and his religious and political notions so congenial with those in which Langton had been educated, that he conceived for him that veneration and attachment which he ever preserved. Johnson was not the less ready to love Mr. Langton, for his being of a very ancient family; for I have heard him say, with pleasure, &lsquo;Langton, Sir, has a grant of free warren from Henry the Second; and Cardinal Stephen Langton, in King John&rsquo;s reign, was of this family.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Mr. Langton afterwards went to pursue his studies at Trinity College, Oxford, where he formed an acquaintance with his fellow student, Mr. Topham Beauclerk; who, though their opinions and modes of life were so different, that it seemed utterly improbable that they should at all agree, had so ardent a love of literature, so acute an understanding, such elegance of manners, and so well discerned the excellent qualities of Mr. Langton, a gentleman eminent not only for worth and learning, but for an inexhaustible fund of entertaining conversation, that they became intimate friends.</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson, soon after this acquaintance began, passed a considerable time at Oxford. He at first thought it strange that Langton should associate so much with one who had the character of being loose, both in his principles and practice; but, by degrees, he himself was fascinated. Mr. Beauclerk&rsquo;s being of the St. Alban&rsquo;s family, and having, in some particulars, a resemblance to Charles the Second, contributed, in Johnson&rsquo;s imagination, to throw a lustre upon his other qualities; and, in a short time, the moral, pious Johnson, and the gay, dissipated Beauclerk, were companions. &lsquo;What a coalition! (said Garrick, when he heard of this;) I shall have my old friend to bail out of the Round-house.&rsquo; But I can bear testimony that it was a very agreeable association. Beauclerk was too polite, and valued learning and wit too much, to offend Johnson by sallies of infidelity or licentiousness; and Johnson delighted in the good qualities of Beauclerk, and hoped to correct the evil. Innumerable were the scenes in which Johnson was amused by these young men. Beauclerk could take more liberty with him, than any body with whom I ever saw him; but, on the other hand, Beauclerk was not spared by his respectable companion, when reproof was proper. Beauclerk had such a propensity to satire, that at one time Johnson said to him, &lsquo;You never open your mouth but with intention to give pain; and you have often given me pain, not from the power of what you said, but from seeing your intention.&rsquo; At another time applying to him, with a slight alteration, a line of Pope, he said,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Thy love of folly, and thy scorn of fools.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Every thing thou dost shews the one, and every thing thou say&rsquo;st the other.&rsquo; At another time he said to him, &lsquo;Thy body is all vice, and thy mind all virtue.&rsquo; Beauclerk not seeming to relish the compliment, Johnson said, &lsquo;Nay, Sir, Alexander the Great, marching in triumph into Babylon, could not have desired to have had more said to him.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson was some time with Beauclerk at his house at Windsor, where he was entertained with experiments in natural philosophy. One Sunday, when the weather was very fine, Beauclerk enticed him, insensibly, to saunter about all the morning. They went into a church-yard, in the time of divine service, and Johnson laid himself down at his ease upon one of the tomb-stones. &lsquo;Now, Sir, (said Beauclerk) you are like Hogarth&rsquo;s Idle Apprentice.&rsquo; When Johnson got his pension, Beauclerk said to him, in the humorous phrase of Falstaff, &lsquo;I hope you&rsquo;ll now purge and live cleanly like a gentleman.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">One night when Beauclerk and Langton had supped at a tavern in London, and sat till about three in the morning, it came into their heads to go and knock up Johnson, and see if they could prevail on him to join them in a ramble. They rapped violently at the door of his chambers in the Temple, till at last he appeared in his shirt, with his little black wig on the top of his head, instead of a nightcap, and a poker in his hand, imagining, probably, that some ruffians were coming to attack him. When he discovered who they were, and was told their errand, he smiled, and with great good humour agreed to their proposal: &lsquo;What, is it you, you dogs! I&rsquo;ll have a frisk with you.&rsquo; He was soon drest, and they sallied forth together into Covent-Garden, where the greengrocers and fruiterers were beginning to arrange their hampers, just come in from the country. Johnson made some attempts to help them; but the honest gardeners stared so at his figure and manner, and odd interference, that he soon saw his services were not relished. They then repaired to one of the neighbouring taverns, and made a bowl of that liquor called &ldquo;<span class="t8">Bishop</span>&rdquo;, which Johnson had always liked; while in joyous contempt of sleep, from which he had been roused, he repeated the festive lines,</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;Short, O short then be thy reign,<br/>And give us to the world again!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">They did not stay long, but walked down to the Thames, took a boat, and rowed to Billingsgate. Beauclerk and Johnson were so well pleased with their amusement, that they resolved to persevere in dissipation for the rest of the day: but Langton deserted them, being engaged to breakfast with some young Ladies. Johnson scolded him for &lsquo;leaving his social friends, to go and sit with a set of wretched <span class="t8">un-idea&rsquo;d</span> girls.&rsquo; Garrick being told of this ramble, said to him smartly, &lsquo;I heard of your frolick t&rsquo;other night. You&rsquo;ll be in the Chronicle.&rsquo; Upon which Johnson afterwards observed, &lsquo;<span class="t8">He</span> durst not do such a thing. His <span class="t8">wife</span> would not <span class="t8">let</span> him!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">1753: ÆTAT. 44. &mdash; He entered upon this year 1753 with his usual piety, as appears from the following prayer, which I transcribed from that part of his diary which he burnt a few days before his death:</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Jan. 1, 1753, N. S. which I shall use for the future.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Almighty God, who hast continued my life to this day, grant that, by the assistance of thy Holy Spirit, I may improve the time which thou shall grant me, to my eternal salvation. Make me to remember, to thy glory, thy judgements and thy mercies. Make me so to consider the loss of my wife, whom thou hast taken from me, that it may dispose me, by thy grace, to lead the residue of my life in thy fear. Grant this, O LORD, for JESUS CHRIST&rsquo;S sake. Amen.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He now relieved the drudgery of his <span class="t8">Dictionary</span>, and the melancholy of his grief, by taking an active part in the composition of <span class="t8">The Adventurer</span>, in which he began to write April 10, marking his essays with the signature T, by which most of his papers in that collection are distinguished: those, however, which have that signature and also that of <span class="t8">Mysargyrus</span>, were not written by him, but, as I suppose, by Dr. Bathurst. Indeed Johnson&rsquo;s energy of thought and richness of language, are still more decisive marks than any signature. As a proof of this, my readers, I imagine, will not doubt that Number 39, on sleep, is his; for it not only has the general texture and colour of his style, but the authours with whom he was peculiarly conversant are readily introduced in it in cursory allusion. The translation of a passage in Statius quoted in that paper, and marked C. B. has been erroneously ascribed to Dr. Bathurst, whose Christian name was Richard. How much this amiable man actually contributed to <span class="t8">The Adventurer</span>, cannot be known. Let me add, that Hawkesworth&rsquo;s imitations of Johnson are sometimes so happy, that it is extremely difficult to distinguish them, with certainty, from the compositions of his great archetype. Hawkesworth was his closest imitator, a circumstance of which that writer would once have been proud to be told; though, when he had become elated by having risen into some degree of consequence, he, in a conversation with me, had the provoking effrontery to say he was not sensible of it.</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson was truly zealous for the success of <span class="t8">The Adventurer</span>; and very soon after his engaging in it, he wrote the following letter:</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">&lsquo;TO THE REVEREND DR. JOSEPH WARTON.</span></p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I ought to have written to you before now, but I ought to do many things which I do not; nor can I, indeed, claim any merit from this letter; for being desired by the authours and proprietor of <span class="t8">The Adventurer</span> to look out for another hand, my thoughts necessarily fixed upon you, whose fund of literature will enable you to assist them, with very little interruption of your studies.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;They desire you to engage to furnish one paper a month, at two guineas a paper, which you may very readily perform. We have considered that a paper should consist of pieces of imagination, pictures of life, and disquisitions of literature. The part which depends on the imagination is very well supplied, as you will find when you read the paper; for descriptions of life, there is now a treaty almost made with an authour and an authouress; and the province of criticism and literature they are very desirous to assign to the commentator on Virgil.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I hope this proposal will not be rejected, and that the next post will bring us your compliance. I speak as one of the fraternity, though I have no part in the paper, beyond now and then a motto; but two of the writers are my particular friends, and I hope the pleasure of seeing a third united to them, will not be denied to, dear Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your most obedient,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;And most humble servant,</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;March 8, 1753.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">The consequence of this letter was, Dr. Warton&rsquo;s enriching the collection with several admirable essays.</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson&rsquo;s saying &lsquo;I have no part in the paper beyond now and then a motto,&rsquo; may seem inconsistent with his being the authour of the papers marked T. But he had, at this time, written only one number; and besides, even at any after period, he might have used the same expression, considering it as a point of honour not to own them; for Mrs. Williams told me that, &lsquo;as he had <span class="t8">given</span> those Essays to Dr. Bathurst, who sold them at two guineas each, he never would own them; nay, he used to say he did not <span class="t8">write</span> them: but the fact was, that he <span class="t8">dictated</span> them, while Bathurst wrote.&rsquo; I read to him Mrs. Williams&rsquo;s account; he smiled, and said nothing.</p>
<p class="p24">I am not quite satisfied with the casuistry by which the productions of one person are thus passed upon the world for the productions of another. I allow that not only knowledge, but powers and qualities of mind may be communicated; but the actual effect of individual exertion never can be transferred, with truth, to any other than its own original cause. One person&rsquo;s child may be made the child of another person by adoption, as among the Romans, or by the ancient Jewish mode of a wife having children born to her upon her knees, by her handmaid. But these were children in a different sense from that of nature. It was clearly understood that they were not of the blood of their nominal parents. So in literary children, an authour may give the profits and fame of his composition to another man, but cannot make that other the real authour. A Highland gentleman, a younger branch of a family, once consulted me if he could not validly purchase the Chieftainship of his family, from the Chief who was willing to sell it. I told him it was impossible for him to acquire, by purchase, a right to be a different person from what he really was; for that the right of Chieftainship attached to the blood of primogeniture, and, therefore, was incapable of being transferred. I added, that though Esau sold his birth-right, or the advantages belonging to it, he still remained the first-born of his parents; and that whatever agreement a Chief might make with any of the clan, the Herald&rsquo;s Office could not admit of the metamorphosis, or with any decency attest that the younger was the elder; but I did not convince the worthy gentleman.</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson&rsquo;s papers in <span class="t8">The Adventurer</span> are very similar to those of <span class="t8">The Rambler</span>; but being rather more varied in their subjects, and being mixed with essays by other writers, upon topicks more generally attractive than even the most elegant ethical discourses, the sale of the work, at first, was more extensive. Without meaning, however, to depreciate <span class="t8">The Adventurer</span>, I must observe that as the value of <span class="t8">The Rambler</span> came, in the progress of time, to be better known, it grew upon the publick estimation, and that its sale has far exceeded that of any other periodical papers since the reign of Queen Anne.</p>
<p class="p24">In one of the books of his diary I find the following entry:</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Apr. 3, 1753. I began the second vol. of my Dictionary, room being left in the first for Preface, Grammar, and History, none of them yet begun.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;O GOD, who hast hitherto supported me, enable me to proceed in this labour, and in the whole task of my present state; that when I shall render up, at the last day, an account of the talent committed to me, I may receive pardon, for the sake of JESUS CHRIST. Amen.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p26">He this year favoured Mrs. Lennox with a Dedication[*] to the Earl of<br/>Orrery, of her <span class="t8">Shakspeare Illustrated</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">1754: ÆTAT. 45. &mdash; IN 1754 I can trace nothing published by him, except his numbers of <span class="t8">The Adventurer</span>, and &lsquo;The Life of Edward Cave,&rsquo;[*] in the <span class="t8">Gentleman&rsquo;s Magazine</span> for February. In biography there can be no question that he excelled, beyond all who have attempted that species of composition; upon which, indeed, he set the highest value. To the minute selection of characteristical circumstances, for which the ancients were remarkable, he added a philosophical research, and the most perspicuous and energetick language. Cave was certainly a man of estimable qualities, and was eminently diligent and successful in his own business, which, doubtless, entitled him to respect. But he was peculiarly fortunate in being recorded by Johnson, who, of the narrow life of a printer and publisher, without any digressions or adventitious circumstances, has made an interesting and agreeable narrative.</p>
<p class="p24">The <span class="t8">Dictionary</span>, we may believe, afforded Johnson full occupation this year. As it approached to its conclusion, he probably worked with redoubled vigour, as seamen increase their exertion and alacrity when they have a near prospect of their haven.</p>
<p class="p24">Lord Chesterfield, to whom Johnson had paid the high compliment of addressing to his Lordship the <span class="t8">Plan</span> of his <span class="t8">Dictionary</span>, had behaved to him in such a manner as to excite his contempt and indignation. The world has been for many years amused with a story confidently told, and as confidently repeated with additional circumstances, that a sudden disgust was taken by Johnson upon occasion of his having been one day kept long in waiting in his Lordship&rsquo;s antechamber, for which the reason assigned was, that he had company with him; and that at last, when the door opened, out walked Colley Gibber; and that Johnson was so violently provoked when he found for whom he had been so long excluded, that he went away in a passion, and never would return. I remember having mentioned this story to George Lord Lyttelton, who told me, he was very intimate with Lord Chesterfield; and holding it as a well-known truth, defended Lord Chesterfield, by saying, that &lsquo;Gibber, who had been introduced, familiarly by the back-stairs, had probably not been there above ten minutes.&rsquo; It may seem strange even to entertain a doubt concerning a story so long and so widely current, and thus implicitly adopted, if not sanctioned, by the authority which I have mentioned; but Johnson himself assured me, that there was not the least foundation for it. He told me, that there never was any particular incident which produced a quarrel between Lord Chesterfield and him; but that his Lordship&rsquo;s continued neglect was the reason why he resolved to have no connection with him. When the <span class="t8">Dictionary</span> was upon the eve of publication, Lord Chesterfield, who, it is said, had flattered himself with expectations that Johnson would dedicate the work to him, attempted, in a courtly manner, to sooth, and insinuate himself with the Sage, conscious, as it should seem, of the cold indifference with which he had treated its learned authour; and further attempted to conciliate him, by writing two papers in <span class="t8">The World</span>, in recommendation of the work; and it must be confessed, that they contain some studied compliments, so finely turned, that if there had been no previous offence, it is probable that Johnson would have been highly delighted. Praise, in general, was pleasing to him; but by praise from a man of rank and elegant accomplishments, he was peculiarly gratified.</p>
<p class="p24">His Lordship says,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I think the publick in general, and the republick of letters in particular, are greatly obliged to Mr. Johnson, for having undertaken, and executed, so great and desirable a work. Perfection is not to be expected from man; but if we are to judge by the various works of Johnson already published, we have good reason to believe, that he will bring this as near to perfection as any man could do. The <span class="t8">Plan</span> of it, which he published some years ago, seems to me to be a proof of it. Nothing can be more rationally imagined, or more accurately and elegantly expressed. I therefore recommend the previous perusal of it to all those who intend to buy the <span class="t8">Dictionary,</span> and who, I suppose, are all those who can afford it.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p10">* * * * *</p>
<p class="p21">&lsquo;It must be owned, that our language is, at present, in a state of anarchy, and hitherto, perhaps, it may not have been the worse for it. During our free and open trade, many words and expressions have been imported, adopted, and naturalized from other languages, which have greatly enriched our own. Let it still preserve what real strength and beauty it may have borrowed from others; but let it not, like the Tarpeian maid, be overwhelmed and crushed by unnecessary ornaments. The time for discrimination seems to be now come.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Toleration, adoption, and naturalization have run their lengths. Good order and authority are now necessary. But where shall we find them, and, at the same time, the obedience due to them? We must have recourse to the old Roman expedient in times of confusion, and chuse a dictator. Upon this principle, I give my vote for Mr. Johnson to fill that great and arduous post. And I hereby declare, that I make a total surrender of all my rights and privileges in the English language, as a free-born British subject, to the said Mr. Johnson, during the term of his dictatorship. Nay more, I will not only obey him, like an old Roman, as my dictator, but, like a modern Roman, I will implicitly believe in him as my Pope, and hold him to be infallible while in the chair, but no longer. More than this he cannot well require; for, I presume, that obedience can never be expected, when there is neither terrour to enforce, nor interest to invite it.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p10">* * * * *</p>
<p class="p21">&lsquo;But a Grammar, a Dictionary, and a History of our Language through its several stages, were still wanting at home, and importunately called for from abroad. Mr. Johnson&rsquo;s labours will now, I dare say, very fully supply that want, and greatly contribute to the farther spreading of our language in other countries. Learners were discouraged, by finding no standard to resort to; and, consequently, thought it incapable of any. They will now be undeceived and encouraged.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">This courtly device failed of its effect. Johnson, who thought that &lsquo;all was false and hollow,&rsquo; despised the honeyed words, and was even indignant that Lord Chesterfield should, for a moment, imagine that he could be the dupe of such an artifice. His expression to me concerning Lord Chesterfield, upon this occasion, was, &lsquo;Sir, after making great professions, he had, for many years, taken no notice of me; but when my <span class="t8">Dictionary</span> was coming out, he fell a scribbling in <span class="t8">The World</span> about it. Upon which, I wrote him a letter expressed in civil terms, but such as might shew him that I did not mind what he said or wrote, and that I had done with him.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">This is that celebrated letter of which so much has been said, and about which curiosity has been so long excited, without being gratified. I for many years solicited Johnson to favour me with a copy of it, that so excellent a composition might not be lost to posterity. He delayed from time to time to give it me; till at last in 1781, when we were on a visit at Mr. Dilly&rsquo;s, at Southill in Bedfordshire, he was pleased to dictate it to me from memory. He afterwards found among his papers a copy of it, which he had dictated to Mr. Baretti, with its title and corrections, in his own handwriting. This he gave to Mr. Langton; adding that if it were to come into print, he wished it to be from that copy. By Mr. Langton&rsquo;s kindness, I am enabled to enrich my work with a perfect transcript of what the world has so eagerly desired to see.</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">&lsquo;TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE THE EARL OF CHESTERFIELD.</span></p>
<p class="p21">&lsquo;February 7, 1755.</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">&lsquo;MY LORD,</span></p>
<p class="p21">&lsquo;I have been lately informed, by the proprietor of the World, that two papers, in which my Dictionary is recommended to the publick, were written by your Lordship. To be so distinguished, is an honour, which, being very little accustomed to favours from the great, I know not well how to receive, or in what terms to acknowledge.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;When, upon some slight encouragement, I first visited your Lordship, I was overpowered, like the rest of mankind, by the enchantment of your address; and could not forbear to wish that I might boast myself <span class="t8">Le vainqueur du vainqueur de la terre</span>; &mdash; that I might obtain that regard for which I saw the world contending; but I found my attendance so little encouraged, that neither pride nor modesty would suffer me to continue it. When I had once addressed your Lordship in publick, I had exhausted all the art of pleasing which a retired and uncourtly scholar can possess. I had done all that I could; and no man is well pleased to have his all neglected, be it ever so little.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Seven years, my Lord, have now past, since I waited in your outward rooms, or was repulsed from your door; during which time I have been pushing on my work through difficulties, of which it is useless to complain, and have brought it, at last, to the verge of publication, without one act of assistance, one word of encouragement, or one smile of favour. Such treatment I did not expect, for I never had a Patron before.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The shepherd in Virgil grew at last acquainted with Love, and found him a native of the rocks.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Is not a Patron, my Lord, one who looks with unconcern on a man struggling for life in the water, and, when he has reached ground, encumbers him with help? The notice which you have been pleased to take of my labours, had it been early, had been kind; but it has been delayed till I am indifferent, and cannot enjoy it; till I am solitary, and cannot impart it; till I am known, and do not want it. I hope it is no very cynical asperity not to confess obligations where no benefit has been received, or to be unwilling that the Publick should consider me as owing that to a Patron, which Providence has enabled me to do for myself.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Having carried on my work thus far with so little obligation to any favourer of learning, I shall not be disappointed though I should conclude it, if less be possible, with less; for I have been long wakened from that dream of hope, in which I once boasted myself with so much exultation.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;My Lord,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your Lordship&rsquo;s most humble,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Most obedient servant,</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;While this was the talk of the town, (says Dr. Adams, in a letter to me) I happened to visit Dr. Warburton, who finding that I was acquainted with Johnson, desired me earnestly to carry his compliments to him, and to tell him, that he honoured him for his manly behaviour in rejecting these condescensions of Lord Chesterfield, and for resenting the treatment he had received from him, with a proper spirit. Johnson was visibly pleased with this compliment, for he had always a high opinion of Warburton. Indeed, the force of mind which appeared in this letter, was congenial with that which Warburton himself amply possessed.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">There is a curious minute circumstance which struck me, in comparing the various editions of Johnson&rsquo;s imitations of Juvenal. In the tenth Satire, one of the couplets upon the vanity of wishes even for literary distinction stood thus:</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;Yet think what ills the scholar&rsquo;s life assail,<br/>&lsquo;Pride, envy, want, the <span class="t8">garret</span>, and the jail.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">But after experiencing the uneasiness which Lord Chesterfield&rsquo;s fallacious patronage made him feel, he dismissed the word <span class="t8">garret</span> from the sad group, and in all the subsequent editions the line stands</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Pride, envy, want, the <span class="t8">Patron</span>, and the jail.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">That Lord Chesterfield must have been mortified by the lofty contempt, and polite, yet keen satire with which Johnson exhibited him to himself in this letter, it is impossible to doubt. He, however, with that glossy duplicity which was his constant study, affected to be quite unconcerned. Dr. Adams mentioned to Mr. Robert Dodsley that he was sorry Johnson had written his letter to Lord Chesterfield. Dodsley, with the true feelings of trade, said &lsquo;he was very sorry too; for that he had a property in the <span class="t8">Dictionary</span>, to which his Lordship&rsquo;s patronage might have been of consequence.&rsquo; He then told Dr. Adams, that Lord Chesterfield had shewn him the letter. &lsquo;I should have imagined (replied Dr. Adams) that Lord Chesterfield would have concealed it.&rsquo; &lsquo;Poh! (said Dodsley) do you think a letter from Johnson could hurt Lord Chesterfield? Not at all, Sir. It lay upon his table, where any body might see it. He read it to me; said, &ldquo;this man has great powers,&rdquo; pointed out the severest passages, and observed how well they were expressed.&rsquo; This air of indifference, which imposed upon the worthy Dodsley, was certainly nothing but a specimen of that dissimulation which Lord Chesterfield inculcated as one of the most essential lessons for the conduct of life. His Lordship endeavoured to justify himself to Dodsley from the charges brought against him by Johnson; but we may judge of the flimsiness of his defence, from his having excused his neglect of Johnson, by saying that &lsquo;he had heard he had changed his lodgings, and did not know where he lived;&rsquo; as if there could have been the smallest difficulty to inform himself of that circumstance, by inquiring in the literary circle with which his Lordship was well acquainted, and was, indeed, himself one of its ornaments.</p>
<p class="p24">Dr. Adams expostulated with Johnson, and suggested, that his not being admitted when he called on him, was, probably, not to be imputed to Lord Chesterfield; for his Lordship had declared to Dodsley, that &lsquo;he would have turned off the best servant he ever had, if he had known that he denied him to a man who would have been always more than welcome;&rsquo; and, in confirmation of this, he insisted on Lord Chesterfield&rsquo;s general affability and easiness of access, especially to literary men. &lsquo;Sir, (said Johnson) that is not Lord Chesterfield; he is the proudest man this day existing.&rsquo; &lsquo;No, (said Dr. Adams) there is one person, at least, as proud; I think, by your own account, you are the prouder man of the two.&rsquo; &lsquo;But mine (replied Johnson, instantly) was defensive pride.&rsquo; This, as Dr. Adams well observed, was one of those happy turns for which he was so remarkably ready.</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson having now explicitly avowed his opinion of Lord Chesterfield, did not refrain from expressing himself concerning that nobleman with pointed freedom: &lsquo;This man (said he) I thought had been a Lord among wits; but, I find, he is only a wit among Lords!&rsquo; And when his <span class="t8">Letters</span> to his natural son were published, he observed, that &lsquo;they teach the morals of a whore, and the manners of a dancing master.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">The character of &lsquo;a respectable Hottentot,&rsquo; in Lord Chesterfield&rsquo;s letters, has been generally understood to be meant for Johnson, and I have no doubt that it was. But I remember when the <span class="t8">Literary Property</span> of those letters was contested in the Court of Session in Scotland, and Mr. Henry Dundas, one of the counsel for the proprietors, read this character as an exhibition of Johnson, Sir David Dalrymple, Lord Hailes, one of the Judges, maintained, with some warmth, that it was not intended as a portrait of Johnson, but of a late noble Lord, distinguished for abstruse science. I have heard Johnson himself talk of the character, and say that it was meant for George Lord Lyttelton, in which I could by no means agree; for his Lordship had nothing of that violence which is a conspicuous feature in the composition. Finding that my illustrious friend could bear to have it supposed that it might be meant for him, I said, laughingly, that there was one trait which unquestionably did not belong to him; &lsquo;he throws his meat any where but down his throat.&rsquo; &lsquo;Sir, (said he,) Lord Chesterfield never saw me eat in his life.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On the 6th of March came out Lord Bolingbroke&rsquo;s works, published by Mr. David Mallet. The wild and pernicious ravings, under the name of <span class="t8">Philosophy</span>, which were thus ushered into the world, gave great offence to all well-principled men. Johnson, hearing of their tendency, which nobody disputed, was roused with a just indignation, and pronounced this memorable sentence upon the noble authour and his editor. &lsquo;Sir, he was a scoundrel, and a coward: a scoundrel, for charging a blunderbuss against religion and morality; a coward, because he had not resolution to fire it off himself, but left half a crown to a beggarly Scotchman, to draw the trigger after his death!&rsquo; Garrick, who I can attest from my own knowledge, had his mind seasoned with pious reverence, and sincerely disapproved of the infidel writings of several, whom, in the course of his almost universal gay intercourse with men of eminence, he treated with external civility, distinguished himself upon this occasion. Mr. Pelham having died on the very day on which Lord Bolingbroke&rsquo;s works came out, he wrote an elegant Ode on his death, beginning</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;Let others hail the rising sun,<br/>I bow to that whose course is run;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">in which is the following stanza:</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;The same sad morn, to Church and State<br/>(So for our sins &rsquo;twas fix&rsquo;d by fate,)<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;A double stroke was given;<br/>Black as the whirlwinds of the North,<br/>St. John&rsquo;s fell genius issued forth,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;And Pelham fled to heaven.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson this year found an interval of leisure to make an excursion to Oxford, for the purpose of consulting the libraries there. Of this, and of many interesting circumstances concerning him, during a part of his life when he conversed but little with the world, I am enabled to give a particular account, by the liberal communications of the Reverend Mr. Thomas Warton, who obligingly furnished me with several of our common friend&rsquo;s letters, which he illustrated with notes. These I shall insert in their proper places.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To THE REVEREND MR. THOMAS WARTON.</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;It is but an ill return for the book with which you were pleased to favour me, to have delayed my thanks for it till now. I am too apt to be negligent; but I can never deliberately shew my disrespect to a man of your character: and I now pay you a very honest acknowledgement, for the advancement of the literature of our native country. You have shewn to all, who shall hereafter attempt the study of our ancient authours, the way to success; by directing them to the perusal of the books which those authours had read. Of this method, Hughes and men much greater than Hughes, seem never to have thought. The reason why the authours, which are yet read, of the sixteenth century, are so little understood, is, that they are read alone; and no help is borrowed from those who lived with them, or before them. Some part of this ignorance I hope to remove by my book, which now draws towards its end; but which I cannot finish to my mind, without visiting the libraries at Oxford, which I, therefore, hope to see in a fortnight. I know not how long I shall stay, or where I shall lodge: but shall be sure to look for you at my arrival, and we shall easily settle the rest. I am, dear Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your most obedient, &amp;c.</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;[London] July 16, 1754.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Of his conversation while at Oxford at this time, Mr. Warton preserved and communicated to me the following memorial, which, though not written with all the care and attention which that learned and elegant writer bestowed on those compositions which he intended for the publick eye, is so happily expressed in an easy style, that I should injure it by any alteration:</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;When Johnson came to Oxford in 1754, the long vacation was beginning, and most people were leaving the place. This was the first time of his being there, after quitting the University. The next morning after his arrival, he wished to see his old College, <span class="t8">Pembroke</span>. I went with him. He was highly pleased to find all the College-servants which he had left there still remaining, particularly a very old butler; and expressed great satisfaction at being recognised by them, and conversed with them familiarly. He waited on the master, Dr. Radcliffe, who received him very coldly. Johnson at least expected, that the master would order a copy of his Dictionary, now near publication: but the master did not choose to talk on the subject, never asked Johnson to dine, nor even to visit him, while he stayed at Oxford. After we had left the lodgings, Johnson said to me, &ldquo;<span class="t8">There</span> lives a man, who lives by the revenues of literature, and will not move a finger to support it. If I come to live at Oxford, I shall take up my abode at Trinity.&rdquo; We then called on the Reverend Mr. Meeke, one of the fellows, and of Johnson&rsquo;s standing. Here was a most cordial greeting on both sides. On leaving him, Johnson said, &ldquo;I used to think Meeke had excellent parts, when we were boys together at the College: but, alas!</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;&ldquo;Lost in a convent&rsquo;s solitary gloom!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;&ldquo;I remember, at the classical lecture in the Hall, I could not bear<br/>Meeke&rsquo;s superiority, and I tried to sit as far from him as I could, that<br/>I might not hear him construe.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;As we were leaving the College, he said, &ldquo;Here I translated Pope&rsquo;s Messiah. Which do you think is the best line in it? &mdash; My own favourite is,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;<span class="t8">Vallis aromalicas fundit Saronica nubes</span>.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I told him, I thought it a very sonorous hexameter. I did not tell him, it was not in the Virgilian style. He much regretted that his <span class="t8">first</span> tutor was dead; for whom he seemed to retain the greatest regard. He said, &ldquo;I once had been a whole morning sliding in Christ-Church Meadow, and missed his lecture in logick. After dinner, he sent for me to his room. I expected a sharp rebuke for my idleness, and went with a beating heart. When we were seated, he told me he had sent for me to drink a glass of wine with him, and to tell me, he was <span class="t8">not</span> angry with me for missing his lecture. This was, in fact, a most severe reprimand. Some more of the boys were then sent for, and we spent a very pleasant afternoon.&rdquo; Besides Mr. Meeke, there was only one other Fellow of Pembroke now resident: from both of whom Johnson received the greatest civilities during this visit, and they pressed him very much to have a room in the College.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;In the course of this visit (1754,) Johnson and I walked, three or four times, to Ellsfield, a village beautifully situated about three miles from Oxford, to see Mr. Wise, Radclivian librarian, with whom Johnson was much pleased. At this place, Mr. Wise had fitted up a house and gardens, in a singular manner, but with great taste. Here was an excellent library; particularly, a valuable collection of books in Northern literature, with which Johnson was often very busy. One day Mr. Wise read to us a dissertation which he was preparing for the press, intitled, &ldquo;A History and Chronology of the fabulous Ages.&rdquo; Some old divinities of Thrace, related to the Titans, and called the CABIRI, made a very important part of the theory of this piece; and in conversation afterwards, Mr. Wise talked much of his CABIRI. As we returned to Oxford in the evening, I out-walked Johnson, and he cried out <span class="t8">Suffiamina</span>, a Latin word which came from his mouth with peculiar grace, and was as much as to say, <span class="t8">Put on your drag chain</span>. Before we got home, I again walked too fast for him; and he now cried out, &ldquo;Why, you walk as if you were pursued by all the CABIRI in a body.&rdquo; In an evening, we frequently took long walks from Oxford into the country, returning to supper. Once, in our way home, we viewed the ruins of the abbies of Oseney and Rewley, near Oxford. After at least half an hour&rsquo;s silence, Johnson said, &ldquo;I viewed them with indignation!&rdquo; We had then a long conversation on Gothick buildings; and in talking of the form of old halls, he said, &ldquo;In these halls, the fire place was anciently always in the middle of the room, till the Whigs removed it on one side.&rdquo; &mdash; About this time there had been an execution of two or three criminals at Oxford on a Monday. Soon afterwards, one day at dinner, I was saying that Mr. Swinton the chaplain of the gaol, and also a frequent preacher before the University, a learned man, but often thoughtless and absent, preached the condemnation-sermon on repentance, before the convicts, on the preceding day, Sunday; and that in the close he told his audience, that he should give them the remainder of what he had to say on the subject, the next Lord&rsquo;s Day. Upon which, one of our company, a Doctor of Divinity, and a plain matter-of-fact man, by way of offering an apology for Mr. Swinton, gravely remarked, that he had probably preached the same sermon before the University: &ldquo;Yes, Sir, (says Johnson) but the University were not to be hanged the next morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I forgot to observe before, that when he left Mr. Meeke, (as I have told above) he added, &ldquo;About the same time of life, Meeke was left behind at Oxford to feed on a Fellowship, and I went to London to get my living: now, Sir, see the difference of our literary characters!&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p26">The following letter was written by Dr. Johnson to Mr. Chambers, of<br/>Lincoln College, afterwards Sir Robert Chambers, one of the judges in<br/>India:</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To MR. CHAMBERS OF LINCOLN COLLEGE.</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The commission which I delayed to trouble you with at your departure, I am now obliged to send you; and beg that you will be so kind as to carry it to Mr. Warton, of Trinity, to whom I should have written immediately, but that I know not if he be yet come back to Oxford.</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;In the Catalogue of MSS. of Gr. Brit, see vol. I. pag. 18. MSS. Bodl.<br/>MARTYRIUM xv. <span class="t8">martyrum sub Juliano, auctore Theophylacto</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;It is desired that Mr. Warton will inquire, and send word, what will be the cost of transcribing this manuscript.</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;Vol. II, pag. 32. Num. 1022. 58. COLL. Nov. &mdash; <span class="t8">Commentaria in Acta<br/>Apostol. &mdash; Comment. in Septem Epistolas Catholicas</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;He is desired to tell what is the age of each of these manuscripts: and what it will cost to have a transcript of the two first pages of each.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;If Mr. Warton be not in Oxford, you may try if you can get it done by any body else; or stay till he comes, according to your own convenience. It is for an Italian <span class="t8">literato</span>.</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;The answer is to be directed to his Excellency Mr. Zon, Venetian<br/>Resident, Soho Square.</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;I hope, dear Sir, that you do not regret the change of London for<br/>Oxford. Mr. Baretti is well, and Miss Williams; and we shall all be<br/>glad to hear from you, whenever you shall be so kind as to write to,<br/>Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your most humble servant,</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Nov. 21, 1754.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">The degree of Master of Arts, which, it has been observed, could not be obtained for him at an early period of his life, was now considered as an honour of considerable importance, in order to grace the title-page of his <span class="t8">Dictionary</span>; and his character in the literary world being by this time deservedly high, his friends thought that, if proper exertions were made, the University of Oxford would pay him the compliment.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To THE REVEREND MR. THOMAS WARTON.</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am extremely obliged to you and to Mr. Wise, for the uncommon care which you have taken of my interest: if you can accomplish your kind design, I shall certainly take me a little habitation among you.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The books which I promised to Mr. Wise, I have not been able to procure: but I shall send him a <span class="t8">Finnick Dictionary</span>, the only copy, perhaps, in England, which was presented me by a learned Swede: but I keep it back, that it may make a set of my own books of the new edition, with which I shall accompany it, more welcome. You will assure him of my gratitude.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Poor dear Collins! &mdash; Would a letter give him any pleasure? I have a mind to write.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am glad of your hindrance in your Spenserian design, yet I would not have it delayed. Three hours a day stolen from sleep and amusement will produce it. Let a Servitour transcribe the quotations, and interleave them with references, to save time. This will shorten the work, and lessen the fatigue.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Can I do any thing to promoting the diploma? I would not be wanting to co-operate with your kindness; of which, whatever be the effect, I shall be, dear Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your most obliged, &amp;c.</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;[London,] Nov. 28, 1754.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">To THE SAME.</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am extremely sensible of the favour done me, both by Mr. Wise and yourself. The book cannot, I think, be printed in less than six weeks, nor probably so soon; and I will keep back the title-page, for such an insertion as you seem to promise me. Be pleased to let me know what money I shall send you, for bearing the expence of the affair; and I will take care that you may have it ready at your hand.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I had lately the favour of a letter from your brother, with some account of poor Collins, for whom I am much concerned. I have a notion, that by very great temperance, or more properly abstinence, he may yet recover.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;There is an old English and Latin book of poems by Barclay, called &ldquo;The Ship of Fools;&rdquo; at the end of which are a number of <span class="t8">Eglogues</span>; so he writes it, from <span class="t8">Egloga</span>, which are probably the first in our language. If you cannot find the book I will get Mr. Dodsley to send it you.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I shall be extremely glad to hear from you again, to know, if the affair proceeds. I have mentioned it to none of my friends for fear of being laughed at for my disappointment.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;You know poor Mr. Dodsley has lost his wife; I believe he is much affected. I hope he will not suffer so much as I yet suffer for the loss of mine.</p>
<p class="p24">[Greek: Oimoi. ti d oimoi; Onaeta gar peponthamen.].</p>
<p class="p24">I have ever since seemed to myself broken off from mankind; a kind of solitary wanderer in the wild of life, without any direction, or fixed point of view: a gloomy gazer on a world to which I have little relation. Yet I would endeavour, by the help of you and your brother, to supply the want of closer union, by friendship: and hope to have long the pleasure of being, dear Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Most affectionately your&rsquo;s,</p>

<p class="p24">1755: ÆTAT. 46. &mdash; In 1755 we behold him to great advantage; his degree of Master of Arts conferred upon him, his <span class="t8">Dictionary</span> published, his correspondence animated, his benevolence exercised.</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">&lsquo;TO THE REVEREND MR. THOMAS WARTON.</span></p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I wrote to you some weeks ago, but believe did not direct accurately, and therefore know not whether you had my letter. I would, likewise, write to your brother, but know not where to find him. I now begin to see land, after having wandered, according to Mr. Warburton&rsquo;s phrase, in this vast sea of words. What reception I shall meet with on the shore, I know not; whether the sound of bells, and acclamations of the people, which Ariosto talks of in his last Canto, or a general murmur of dislike, I know not: whether I shall find upon the coast a Calypso that will court, or a Polypheme that will resist. But if Polypheme comes, have at his eye. I hope, however, the criticks will let me be at peace; for though I do not much fear their skill and strength, I am a little afraid of myself, and would not willingly feel so much ill-will in my bosom as literary quarrels are apt to excite.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Mr. Baretti is about a work for which he is in great want of <span class="t8">Crescimbeni</span>, which you may have again when you please.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;There is nothing considerable done or doing among us here. We are not, perhaps, as innocent as villagers, but most of us seem to be as idle. I hope, however, you are busy; and should be glad to know what you are doing.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am, dearest Sir,</p>

<p class="p10"><span class="t4">TO THE SAME.</span></p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I received your letter this day, with great sense of the favour that has been done me; for which I return my most sincere thanks: and entreat you to pay to Mr. Wise such returns as I ought to make for so much kindness so little deserved.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I sent Mr. Wise the <span class="t8">Lexicon</span>, and afterwards wrote to him; but know not whether he had either the book or letter. Be so good as to contrive to enquire.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;But why does my dear Mr. Warton tell me nothing of himself? Where hangs the new volume? Can I help? Let not the past labour be lost, for want of a little more: but snatch what time you can from the Hall, and the pupils, and the coffee-house, and the parks, and complete your design. I am, dear Sir, &amp;c,</p>

<p class="p27">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I had a letter last week from Mr. Wise, but have yet heard nothing from you, nor know in what state my affair stands; of which I beg you to inform me, if you can, to-morrow, by the return of the post.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Mr. Wise sends me word, that he has not had the <span class="t8">Finnick Lexicon</span> yet, which I sent some time ago; and if he has it not, you must enquire after it. However, do not let your letter stay for that.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your brother, who is a better correspondent than you, and not much better, sends me word, that your pupils keep you in College: but do they keep you from writing too? Let them, at least, give you time to write to, dear Sir,</p>

<p class="p27">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Dr. King was with me a few minutes before your letter; this, however, is the first instance in which your kind intentions to me have ever been frustrated. I have now the full effect of your care and benevolence; and am far from thinking it a slight honour, or a small advantage; since it will put the enjoyment of your conversation more frequently in the power of, dear Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your most obliged and affectionate</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;P.S. I have enclosed a letter to the Vice-Chancellor, which you will read; and, if you like it, seal and give him.</p>

<p class="p24">As the Publick will doubtless be pleased to see the whole progress of this well-earned academical honour, I shall insert the Chancellor of Oxford&rsquo;s letter to the University, the diploma, and Johnson&rsquo;s letter of thanks to the Vice-Chancellor.</p>

<p class="p21">&lsquo;Mr. Samuel Johnson, who was formerly of Pembroke College, having very eminently distinguished himself by the publication of a series of essays, excellently calculated to form the manners of the people, and in which the cause of religion and morality is every where maintained by the strongest powers of argument and language; and who shortly intends to publish a <span class="t8">Dictionary of the English Tongue</span>, formed on a new plan, and executed with the greatest labour and judgement; I persuade myself that I shall act agreeably to the sentiments of the whole University, in desiring that it may be proposed in convocation to confer on him the degree of Master of Arts by diploma, to which I readily give my consent; and am,</p>

<p class="p21">&lsquo;To THE REVEREND MR. THOMAS WARTON.</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;After I received my diploma, I wrote you a letter of thanks, with a letter to the Vice-Chancellor, and sent another to Mr. Wise; but have heard from nobody since, and begin to think myself forgotten. It is true, I sent you a double letter, and you may fear an expensive correspondent; but I would have taken it kindly, if you had returned it treble: and what is a double letter to a <span class="t8">petty king</span>, that having <span class="t8">fellowship and fines</span>, can sleep without a <span class="t8">Modus in his head</span>?</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Dear Mr. Warton, let me hear from you, and tell me something, I care not what, so I hear it but from you. Something I will tell you: &mdash; I hope to see my <span class="t8">Dictionary</span> bound and lettered, next week; &mdash; <span class="t8">vastâ mole superbus</span>. And I have a great mind to come to Oxford at Easter; but you will not invite me. Shall I come uninvited, or stay here where nobody perhaps would miss me if I went? A hard choice! But such is the world to, dear Sir,</p>

<p class="p27">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;[London] March 20, 1755.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">To THE SAME.</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Though not to write, when a man can write so well, is an offence sufficiently heinous, yet I shall pass it by, I am very glad that the Vice-Chancellor was pleased with my note. I shall impatiently expect you at London, that we may consider what to do next. I intend in the winter to open a <span class="t8">Bibliothèque</span>, and remember, that you are to subscribe a sheet a year; let us try, likewise, if we cannot persuade your brother to subscribe another. My book is now coming <span class="t8">in luminis oras</span>. What will be its fate I know not, nor think much, because thinking is to no purpose. It must stand the censure of the <span class="t8">great vulgar and the small</span>; of those that understand it, and that understand it not. But in all this, I suffer not alone: every writer has the same difficulties, and, perhaps, every writer talks of them more than he thinks.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;You will be pleased to make my compliments to all my friends: and be so kind, at every idle hour, as to remember, dear Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your, &amp;c.</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;[London,] March 25, 1755.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Dr. Adams told me, that this scheme of a <span class="t8">Bibliothèque</span> was a serious one: for upon his visiting him one day, he found his parlour floor covered with parcels of foreign and English literary journals, and he told Dr. Adams he meant to undertake a Review. &lsquo;How, Sir, (said Dr. Adams,) can you think of doing it alone? All branches of knowledge must be considered in it. Do you know Mathematicks? Do you know Natural History?&rsquo; Johnson answered, &lsquo;Why, Sir, I must do as well as I can. My chief purpose is to give my countrymen a view of what is doing in literature upon the continent; and I shall have, in a good measure, the choice of my subject, for I shall select such books as I best understand.&rsquo; Dr. Adams suggested, that as Dr. Maty had just then finished his <span class="t8">Bibliothèque Britannique</span>, which was a well-executed work, giving foreigners an account of British publications, he might, with great advantage, assume him as an assistant. &lsquo;<span class="t8">He</span>, (said Johnson) the little black dog! I&rsquo;d throw him into the Thames.&rsquo; The scheme, however, was dropped.</p>
<p class="p24">In one of his little memorandum-books I find the following hints for his intended <span class="t8">Review or Literary Journal</span>:</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;<span class="t8">The Annals of Literature, foreign as welt as domestick</span>. Imitate Le Clerk &mdash; Bayle &mdash; Barbeyrac. Infelicity of Journals in England. Works of the learned. We cannot take in all. Sometimes copy from foreign Journalists. Always tell.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To DR. BIRCH.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;March 29, 1755.</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I have sent some parts of my <span class="t8">Dictionary</span>, such as were at hand, for your inspection. The favour which I beg is, that if you do not like them, you will say nothing. I am, Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your most affectionate humble servant,</p>

<p class="p24">&lsquo;To MR. SAMUEL JOHNSON.</p>
<p class="p24">Norfolk-street, April 23, 1755.</p>
<p class="p24">Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The part of your <span class="t8">Dictionary</span> which you have favoured me with the sight of has given me such an idea of the whole, that I most sincerely congratulate the publick upon the acquisition of a work long wanted, and now executed with an industry, accuracy, and judgement, equal to the importance of the subject. You might, perhaps, have chosen one in which your genius would have appeared to more advantage; but you could not have fixed upon any other in which your labours would have done such substantial service to the present age and to posterity. I am glad that your health has supported the application necessary to the performance of so vast a task; and can undertake to promise you as one (though perhaps the only) reward of it, the approbation and thanks of every well-wisher to the honour of the English language. I am, with the greatest regard,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your most faithful and</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Most affectionate humble servant,</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">&lsquo;THO. BIRCH.&rsquo;</span></p>
<p class="p21">Mr. Charles Burney, who has since distinguished himself so much in the science of Musick, and obtained a Doctor&rsquo;s degree from the University of Oxford, had been driven from the capital by bad health, and was now residing at Lynne Regis, in Norfolk. He had been so much delighted with Johnson&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Rambler</span> and the <span class="t8">Plan</span> of his <span class="t8">Dictionary</span>, that when the great work was announced in the news-papers as nearly finished, he wrote to Dr. Johnson, begging to be informed when and in what manner his <span class="t8">Dictionary</span> would be published; intreating, if it should be by subscription, or he should have any books at his own disposal, to be favoured with six copies for himself and friends.</p>
<p class="p24">In answer to this application, Dr. Johnson wrote the following letter, of which (to use Dr. Burney&rsquo;s own words) &lsquo;if it be remembered that it was written to an obscure young man, who at this time had not much distinguished himself even in his own profession, but whose name could never have reached the authour of <span class="t8">The Rambler</span>, the politeness and urbanity may be opposed to some of the stories which have been lately circulated of Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s natural rudeness and ferocity.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To MR. BURNKY, IN LYNNE REGIS, NORFOLK.</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;If you imagine that by delaying my answer I intended to shew any neglect of the notice with which you have favoured me, you will neither think justly of yourself nor of me. Your civilities were offered with too much elegance not to engage attention; and I have too much pleasure in pleasing men like you, not to feel very sensibly the distinction which you have bestowed upon me.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Few consequences of my endeavours to please or to benefit mankind have delighted me more than your friendship thus voluntarily offered, which now I have it I hope to keep, because I hope to continue to deserve it.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I have no <span class="t8">Dictionaries</span> to dispose of for myself, but shall be glad to have you direct your friends to Mr. Dodsley, because it was by his recommendation that I was employed in the work.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;When you have leisure to think again upon me, let me be favoured with another letter; and another yet, when you have looked into my <span class="t8">Dictionary</span>. If you find faults, I shall endeavour to mend them; if you find none, I shall think you blinded by kind partiality: but to have made you partial in his favour, will very much gratify the ambition of, Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your most obliged</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;And most humble servant,</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Cough-square, Fleet-street,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;April 8, 1755,&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Mr. Andrew Millar, bookseller in the Strand, took the principal charge of conducting the publication of Johnson&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Dictionary</span>; and as the patience of the proprietors was repeatedly tried and almost exhausted, by their expecting that the work would be completed within the time which Johnson had sanguinely supposed, the learned authour was often goaded to dispatch, more especially as he had received all the copy-money, by different drafts, a considerable time before he had finished his task. When the messenger who carried the last sheet to Millar returned, Johnson asked him, &lsquo;Well, what did he say?&rsquo;&mdash; &lsquo;Sir, (answered the messenger) he said, thank GOD I have done with him.&rsquo; &lsquo;I am glad (replied Johnson, with a smile) that he thanks GOD for any thing.&rsquo; It is remarkable that those with whom Johnson chiefly contracted for his literary labours were Scotchmen, Mr. Millar and Mr. Strahan. Millar, though himself no great judge of literature, had good sense enough to have for his friends very able men to give him their opinion and advice in the purchase of copyright; the consequence of which was his acquiring a very large fortune, with great liberality. Johnson said of him, &lsquo;I respect Millar, Sir; he has raised the price of literature.&rsquo; The same praise may be justly given to Panckoucke, the eminent bookseller of Paris. Mr. Strahan&rsquo;s liberality, judgement, and success, are well known.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To BENNET LANGTON, ESQ., AT LANGTON NEAR SPILSBY, LINCOLNSHIRE.</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;It has been long observed, that men do not suspect faults which they do not commit; your own elegance of manners, and punctuality of complaisance, did not suffer you to impute to me that negligence of which I was guilty, and which I have not since atoned. I received both your letters, and received them with pleasure proportionate to the esteem which so short an acquaintance strongly impressed, and which I hope to confirm by nearer knowledge, though I am afraid that gratification will be for a time withheld.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I have, indeed, published my Book, of which I beg to know your father&rsquo;s judgement, and yours; and I have now staid long enough to watch its progress into the world. It has, you see, no patrons, and, I think, has yet had no opponents, except the criticks of the coffee-house, whose outcries are soon dispersed into the air, and are thought on no more: from this, therefore, I am at liberty, and think of taking the opportunity of this interval to make an excursion; and why not then into Lincolnshire? or, to mention a stronger attraction, why not to dear Mr. Langton? I will give the true reason, which I know you will approve: &mdash; I have a mother more than eighty years old, who has counted the days to the publication of my book, in hopes of seeing me; and to her, if I can disengage myself here, I resolve to go.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;As I know, dear Sir, that to delay my visit for a reason like this, will not deprive me of your esteem, I beg it may not lessen your kindness. I have very seldom received an offer of friendship which I so earnestly desire to cultivate and mature. I shall rejoice to hear from you, till I can see you, and will see you as soon as I can; for when the duty that calls me to Lichfield is discharged, my inclination will carry me to Langton. I shall delight to hear the ocean roar, or see the stars twinkle, in the company of men to whom Nature does not spread her volumes or utter her voice in vain.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Do not, dear Sir, make the slowness of this letter a precedent for delay, or imagine that I approved the incivility that I have committed; for I have known you enough to love you, and sincerely to wish a further knowledge; and I assure you, once more, that to live in a house that contains such a father and such a son, will be accounted a very uncommon degree of pleasure, by, dear Sir, your most obliged, and</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Most humble servant,</p>

<p class="p24">&lsquo;To THE REVEREND MR. THOMAS WARTON.</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am grieved that you should think me capable of neglecting your letters; and beg you will never admit any such suspicion again. I purpose to come down next week, if you shall be there; or any other week, that shall be more agreeable to you. Therefore let me know. I can stay this visit but a week, but intend to make preparations for a longer stay next time; being resolved not to lose sight of the University. How goes Apollonius? Don&rsquo;t let him be forgotten. Some things of this kind must be done, to keep us up. Pay my compliments to Mr. Wise, and all my other friends. I think to come to Kettel-Hall.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am, Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your most affectionate, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="p24">To THE SAME.</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;It is strange how many things will happen to intercept every pleasure, though it [be] only that of two friends meeting together. I have promised myself every day to inform you when you might expect me at Oxford, and have not been able to fix a time. The time, however, is, I think, at last come; and I promise myself to repose in Kettel-Hall, one of the first nights of the next week. I am afraid my stay with you cannot be long; but what is the inference? We must endeavour to make it chearful. I wish your brother could meet us, that we might go and drink tea with Mr. Wise in a body. I hope he will be at Oxford, or at his nest of British and Saxon antiquities. I shall expect to see <span class="t8">Spenser</span> finished, and many other things begun. Dodsley is gone to visit the Dutch. The <span class="t8">Dictionary</span> sells well. The rest of the world goes on as it did. Dear Sir,</p>

<p class="p10"><span class="t4">TO THE SAME.</span></p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To talk of coming to you, and not yet to come, has an air of trifling which I would not willingly have among you; and which, I believe, you will not willingly impute to me, when I have told you, that since my promise, two of our partners are dead, and that I was solicited to suspend my excursion till we could recover from our confusion.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I have not laid aside my purpose; for every day makes me more impatient of staying from you. But death, you know, hears not supplications, nor pays any regard to the convenience of mortals. I hope now to see you next week; but next week is but another name for to-morrow, which has been noted for promising and deceiving.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am, &amp;c.</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;[London,] June 24, 1755.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">To THE SAME.</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I told you, that among the manuscripts are some things of Sir Thomas More. I beg you to pass an hour in looking on them, and procure a transcript of the ten or twenty first lines of each, to be compared with what I have; that I may know whether they are yet published. The manuscripts are these:</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Catalogue of Bodl. MS. pag. 122. F. 3. Sir Thomas More.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;1. Fall of angels. 2. Creation and fall of mankind. 3. Determination of the Trinity for the rescue of mankind. 4. Five lectures of our Saviour&rsquo;s passion. 5. Of the institution of the sacrament, three lectures. 6. How to receive the blessed body of our Lord sacramentally. 7. Neomenia, the new moon. 8. <span class="t8">De tristitia, tædio, pavore, et oratione Christi, ante captionem ejus</span>.</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;Catalogue, pag. 154. Life of Sir Thomas More. <span class="t8">Qu</span>. Whether Roper&rsquo;s?<br/>Pag. 363. <span class="t8">De resignatione Magni Sigilli in manus Regis per D. Thomam<br/>Morum</span>. Pag. 364. <span class="t8">Mori Defensio Morice</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;If you procure the young gentleman in the library to write out what you think fit to be written, I will send to Mr. Prince the bookseller to pay him what you shall think proper.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Be pleased to make my compliments to Mr. Wise, and all my friends.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am, Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your affectionate, &amp;c.</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;<br/>&lsquo;[London] Aug. 7, 1755.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">The <span class="t8">Dictionary</span>, with a <span class="t8">Grammar and History of the English Language</span>, being now at length published, in two volumes folio, the world contemplated with wonder so stupendous a work achieved by one man, while other countries had thought such undertakings fit only for whole academies. Vast as his powers were, I cannot but think that his imagination deceived him, when he supposed that by constant application he might have performed the task in three years. Let the Preface be attentively perused, in which is given, in a clear, strong, and glowing style, a comprehensive, yet particular view of what he had done; and it will be evident, that the time he employed upon it was comparatively short. I am unwilling to swell my book with long quotations from what is in every body&rsquo;s hands, and I believe there are few prose compositions in the English language that are read with more delight, or are more impressed upon the memory, than that preliminary discourse. One of its excellencies has always struck me with peculiar admiration: I mean the perspicuity with which he has expressed abstract scientifick notions. As an instance of this, I shall quote the following sentence: &lsquo;When the radical idea branches out into parallel ramifications, how can a consecutive series be formed of senses in their own nature collateral?&rsquo; We have here an example of what has been often said, and I believe with justice, that there is for every thought a certain nice adaptation of words which none other could equal, and which, when a man has been so fortunate as to hit, he has attained, in that particular case, the perfection of language.</p>
<p class="p24">The extensive reading which was absolutely necessary for the accumulation of authorities, and which alone may account for Johnson&rsquo;s retentive mind being enriched with a very large and various store of knowledge and imagery, must have occupied several years. The Preface furnishes an eminent instance of a double talent, of which Johnson was fully conscious. Sir Joshua Reynolds heard him say, &lsquo;There are two things which I am confident I can do very well: one is an introduction to any literary work, stating what it is to contain, and how it should be executed in the most perfect manner; the other is a conclusion, shewing from various causes why the execution has not been equal to what the authour promised to himself and to the publick.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">How should puny scribblers be abashed and disappointed, when they find him displaying a perfect theory of lexicographical excellence, yet at the same time candidly and modestly allowing that he &lsquo;had not satisfied his own expectations.&rsquo; Here was a fair occasion for the exercise of Johnson&rsquo;s modesty, when he was called upon to compare his own arduous performance, not with those of other individuals, (in which case his inflexible regard to truth would have been violated, had he affected diffidence,) but with speculative perfection; as he, who can outstrip all his competitors in the race, may yet be sensible of his deficiency when he runs against time. Well might he say, that &lsquo;the <span class="t8">English Dictionary</span> was written with little assistance of the learned,&rsquo; for he told me, that the only aid which he received was a paper containing twenty etymologies, sent to him by a person then unknown, who he was afterwards informed was Dr. Pearce, Bishop of Rochester. The etymologies, though they exhibit learning and judgement, are not, I think, entitled to the first praise amongst the various parts of this immense work. The definitions have always appeared to me such astonishing proofs of acuteness of intellect and precision of language, as indicate a genius of the highest rank. This it is which marks the superiour excellence of Johnson&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Dictionary</span> over others equally or even more voluminous, and must have made it a work of much greater mental labour than mere Lexicons, or <span class="t8">Word-books</span>, as the Dutch call them. They, who will make the experiment of trying how they can define a few words of whatever nature, will soon be satisfied of the unquestionable justice of this observation, which I can assure my readers is founded upon much study, and upon communication with more minds than my own.</p>
<p class="p24">A few of his definitions must be admitted to be erroneous. Thus, <span class="t8">Windward</span> and <span class="t8">Leeward</span>, though directly of opposite meaning, are defined identically the same way; as to which inconsiderable specks it is enough to observe, that his Preface announces that he was aware there might be many such in so immense a work; nor was he at all disconcerted when an instance was pointed out to him. A lady once asked him how he came to define <span class="t8">Pastern</span> the <span class="t8">knee</span> of a horse: instead of making an elaborate defence, as she expected, he at once answered, &lsquo;Ignorance, Madam, pure ignorance.&rsquo; His definition of <span class="t8">Network</span> has been often quoted with sportive malignity, as obscuring a thing in itself very plain. But to these frivolous censures no other answer is necessary than that with which we are furnished by his own Preface.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To explain, requires the use of terms less abstruse than that which is to be explained, and such terms cannot always be found. For as nothing can be proved but by supposing something intuitively known, and evident without proof, so nothing can be defined but by the use of words too plain to admit of definition. Sometimes easier words are changed into harder; as, <span class="t8">burial</span>, into <span class="t8">sepulture</span> or <span class="t8">interment; dry</span>, into <span class="t8">desiccative</span>; <span class="t8">dryness</span>, into <span class="t8">siccity</span> or <span class="t8">aridity; fit</span>, into <span class="t8">paroxism</span>; for the <span class="t8">easiest</span> word, whatever it be, can never be translated into one more easy.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">His introducing his own opinions, and even prejudices, under general definitions of words, while at the same time the original meaning of the words is not explained, as his <span class="t8">Tory</span>, <span class="t8">Whig</span>, <span class="t8">Pension</span>, <span class="t8">Oats</span>, <span class="t8">Excise</span>, and a few more, cannot be fully defended, and must be placed to the account of capricious and humorous indulgence. Talking to me upon this subject when we were at Ashbourne in 1777, he mentioned a still stronger instance of the predominance of his private feelings in the composition of this work, than any now to be found in it. &lsquo;You know, Sir, Lord Gower forsook the old Jacobite interest. When I came to the word <span class="t8">Renegado</span>, after telling that it meant &ldquo;one who deserts to the enemy, a revolter,&rdquo; I added, <span class="t8">Sometimes we say a GOWER</span>. Thus it went to the press; but the printer had more wit than I, and struck it out.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Let it, however, be remembered, that this indulgence does not display itself only in sarcasm towards others, but sometimes in playful allusion to the notions commonly entertained of his own laborious task. Thus: &lsquo;<span class="t8">Grub-street</span>, the name of a street in London, much inhabited by writers of small histories, <span class="t8">dictionaries</span>, and temporary poems; whence any mean production is called <span class="t8">Grub-street</span>.&rsquo;&mdash; &lsquo;<span class="t8">Lexicographer</span>, a writer of dictionaries, a <span class="t8">harmless drudge</span>&rsquo;.</p>
<p class="p24">At the time when he was concluding his very eloquent Preface, Johnson&rsquo;s mind appears to have been in such a state of depression, that we cannot contemplate without wonder the vigorous and splendid thoughts which so highly distinguish that performance. &lsquo;I (says he) may surely be contented without the praise of perfection, which if I could obtain in this gloom of solitude, what would it avail me? I have protracted my work till most of those whom I wished to please have sunk into the grave; and success and miscarriage are empty sounds, I therefore dismiss it with frigid tranquillity, having little to fear or hope from censure or from praise.&rsquo; That this indifference was rather a temporary than an habitual feeling, appears, I think, from his letters to Mr. Warton; and however he may have been affected for the moment, certain it is that the honours which his great work procured him, both at home and abroad, were very grateful to him. His friend the Earl of Corke and Orrery, being at Florence, presented it to the <span class="t8">Academia della Crusca</span>. That Academy sent Johnson their <span class="t8">Vocabulario</span>, and the French Academy sent him their <span class="t8">Dictionnaire</span>, which Mr. Langton had the pleasure to convey to him.</p>
<p class="p24">It must undoubtedly seem strange, that the conclusion of his Preface should be expressed in terms so desponding, when it is considered that the authour was then only in his forty-sixth year. But we must ascribe its gloom to that miserable dejection of spirits to which he was constitutionally subject, and which was aggravated by the death of his wife two years before. I have heard it ingeniously observed by a lady of rank and elegance, that &lsquo;his melancholy was then at its meridian.&rsquo; It pleased GOD to grant him almost thirty years of life after this time; and once, when he was in a placid frame of mind, he was obliged to own to me that he had enjoyed happier days, and had many more friends, since that gloomy hour than before.</p>
<p class="p24">It is a sad saying, that &lsquo;most of those whom he wished to please had sunk into the grave;&rsquo; and his case at forty-five was singularly unhappy, unless the circle of his friends was very narrow. I have often thought, that as longevity is generally desired, and I believe, generally expected, it would be wise to be continually adding to the number of our friends, that the loss of some may be supplied by others. Friendship, &lsquo;the wine of life,&rsquo; should like a well-stocked cellar, be thus continually renewed; and it is consolatory to think, that although we can seldom add what will equal the generous <span class="t8">first-growths</span> of our youth, yet friendship becomes insensibly old in much less time than is commonly imagined, and not many years are required to make it very mellow and pleasant. <span class="t8">Warmth</span> will, no doubt, make a considerable difference. Men of affectionate temper and bright fancy will coalesce a great deal sooner than those who are cold and dull.</p>
<p class="p24">The proposition which I have now endeavoured to illustrate was, at a subsequent period of his life, the opinion of Johnson himself. He said to Sir Joshua Reynolds, &lsquo;If a man does not make new acquaintance as he advances through life, he will soon find himself left alone. A man, Sir, should keep his friendship <span class="t8">in constant repair</span>.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">The celebrated Mr. Wilkes, whose notions and habits of life were very opposite to his, but who was ever eminent for literature and vivacity, sallied forth with a little <span class="t8">Jeu d&rsquo;Esprit</span> upon the following passage in his Grammar of the English Tongue, prefixed to the <span class="t8">Dictionary</span>: &lsquo;<span class="t8">H</span> seldom, perhaps never, begins any but the first syllable.&rsquo; In an Essay printed in <span class="t8">The Publick Advertiser</span>, this lively writer enumerated many instances in opposition to this remark; for example, &lsquo;The authour of this observation must be a man of a quick <span class="t8">apprehension</span>, and of a most <span class="t8">compre-hensive</span> genius.&rsquo; The position is undoubtedly expressed with too much latitude.</p>
<p class="p24">This light sally, we may suppose, made no great impression on our Lexicographer; for we find that he did not alter the passage till many years afterwards.</p>
<p class="p24">He had the pleasure of being treated in a very different manner by his old pupil Mr. Garrick, in the following complimentary Epigram:</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;<span class="t8">On</span> JOHNSON&rsquo;S DICTIONARY,</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;Talk of war with a Briton, he&rsquo;ll boldly advance,<br/>That one English soldier will beat ten of France;<br/>Would we alter the boast from the sword to the pen,<br/>Our odds are still greater, still greater our men:<br/>In the deep mines of science though Frenchmen may toil,<br/>Can their strength be compar&rsquo;d to Locke, Newton, and Boyle?<br/>Let them rally their heroes, send forth all their pow&rsquo;rs,<br/>Their verse-men and prose-men, then match them with ours!<br/>First Shakspeare and Milton, like gods in the fight,<br/>Have put their whole drama and epick to flight;<br/>In satires, epistles, and odes, would they cope,<br/>Their numbers retreat before Dryden and Pope;<br/>And Johnson, well arm&rsquo;d like a hero of yore,<br/>Has beat forty French, and will beat forty more!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson this year gave at once a proof of his benevolence, quickness of apprehension, and admirable art of composition, in the assistance which he gave to Mr. Zachariah Williams, father of the blind lady whom he had humanely received under his roof. Mr. Williams had followed the profession of physick in Wales; but having a very strong propensity to the study of natural philosophy, had made many ingenious advances towards a discovery of the longitude, and repaired to London in hopes of obtaining the great parliamentary reward. He failed of success; but Johnson having made himself master of his principles and experiments, wrote for him a pamphlet, published in quarto, with the following title: <span class="t8">An Account of an Attempt to ascertain the Longitude at Sea, by an exact Theory of the Variation of the Magnetical Needle; with a Table of the Variations at the most remarkable Cities in Europe, from the year 1660 to 1680</span>.[Dagger] To diffuse it more extensively, it was accompanied with an Italian translation on the opposite page, which it is supposed was the work of Signor Baretti, an Italian of considerable literature, who having come to England a few years before, had been employed in the capacity both of a language-master and an authour, and formed an intimacy with Dr. Johnson. This pamphlet Johnson presented to the Bodleian Library. On a blank leaf of it is pasted a paragraph cut out of a news-paper, containing an account of the death and character of Williams, plainly written by Johnson.</p>
<p class="p24">In July this year he had formed some scheme of mental improvement, the particular purpose of which does not appear. But we find in his <span class="t8">Prayers and Meditations</span>, p. 25, a prayer entitled &lsquo;On the Study of Philosophy, as an Instrument of living;&rsquo; and after it follows a note, &lsquo;This study was not pursued.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On the 13th of the same month he wrote in his <span class="t8">Journal</span> the following scheme of life, for Sunday:</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Having lived&rsquo; (as he with tenderness of conscience expresses himself) &lsquo;not without an habitual reverence for the Sabbath, yet without that attention to its religious duties which Christianity requires;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;1. To rise early, and in order to it, to go to sleep early on Saturday.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;2. To use some extraordinary devotion in the morning.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;3. To examine the tenour of my life, and particularly the last week; and to mark my advances in religion, or recession from it.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;4. To read the Scripture methodically with such helps as are at hand.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;5. To go to church twice.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;6. To read books of Divinity, either speculative or practical.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;7. To instruct my family.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;8. To wear off by meditation any worldly soil contracted in the week.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">1756: ÆTAT. 47. &mdash; In 1756 Johnson found that the great fame of his <span class="t8">Dictionary</span> had not set him above the necessity of &lsquo;making provision for the day that was passing over him.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">No royal or noble patron extended a munificent hand to give independence to the man who had conferred stability on the language of his country. We may feel indignant that there should have been such unworthy neglect; but we must, at the same time, congratulate ourselves, when we consider, that to this very neglect, operating to rouse the natural indolence of his constitution, we owe many valuable productions, which otherwise, perhaps, might never have appeared.</p>
<p class="p24">He had spent, during the progress of the work, the money for which he had contracted to write his <span class="t8">Dictionary</span>. We have seen that the reward of his labour was only fifteen hundred and seventy-five pounds; and when the expence of amanuenses and paper, and other articles are deducted, his clear profit was very inconsiderable. I once said to him, &lsquo;I am sorry, Sir, you did not get more for your <span class="t8">Dictionary</span>&rsquo;. His answer was, &lsquo;I am sorry, too. But it was very well. The booksellers are generous, liberal-minded men.&rsquo; He, upon all occasions, did ample justice to their character in this respect. He considered them as the patrons of literature; and, indeed, although they have eventually been considerable gainers by his <span class="t8">Dictionary</span>, it is to them that we owe its having been undertaken and carried through at the risk of great expence, for they were not absolutely sure of being indemnified.</p>
<p class="p24">On the first day of this year we find from his private devotions, that he had then recovered from sickness; and in February that his eye was restored to its use. The pious gratitude with which he acknowledges mercies upon every occasion is very edifying; as is the humble submission which he breathes, when it is the will of his heavenly Father to try him with afflictions. As such dispositions become the state of man here, and are the true effects of religious discipline, we cannot but venerate in Johnson one of the most exercised minds that our holy religion hath ever formed. If there be any thoughtless enough to suppose such exercise the weakness of a great understanding, let them look up to Johnson and be convinced that what he so earnestly practised must have a rational foundation.</p>
<p class="p24">His works this year were, an abstract or epitome, in octavo, of his folio <span class="t8">Dictionary</span>, and a few essays in a monthly publication, entitled, <span class="t8">The Universal Visiter</span>. Christopher Smart, with whose unhappy vacillation of mind he sincerely sympathised, was one of the stated undertakers of this miscellany; and it was to assist him that Johnson sometimes employed his pen. All the essays marked with two <span class="t8">asterisks</span> have been ascribed to him; but I am confident, from internal evidence, that of these, neither &lsquo;The Life of Chaucer,&rsquo; &lsquo;Reflections on the State of Portugal,&rsquo; nor an &lsquo;Essay on Architecture,&rsquo; were written by him. I am equally confident, upon the same evidence, that he wrote &lsquo;Further Thoughts on Agriculture;&rsquo;[Dagger] being the sequel of a very inferiour essay on the same subject, and which, though carried on as if by the same hand, is both in thinking and expression so far above it, and so strikingly peculiar, as to leave no doubt of its true parent; and that he also wrote &lsquo;A Dissertation on the State of Literature and Authours,&rsquo;[Dagger] and &lsquo;A Dissertation on the Epitaphs written by Pope.&rsquo;[Dagger] The last of these, indeed, he afterwards added to his <span class="t8">Idler</span>. Why the essays truly written by him are marked in the same manner with some which he did not write, I cannot explain; but with deference to those who have ascribed to him the three essays which I have rejected, they want all the characteristical marks of Johnsonian composition.</p>
<p class="p24">He engaged also to superintend and contribute largely to another monthly publication, entitled <span class="t8">The Literary Magazine, or Universal Review</span>; the first number of which came out in May this year. What were his emoluments from this undertaking, and what other writers were employed in it, I have not discovered. He continued to write in it, with intermissions, till the fifteenth number; and I think that he never gave better proofs of the force, acuteness, and vivacity of his mind, than in this miscellany, whether we consider his original essays, or his reviews of the works of others. The &lsquo;Preliminary Address&rsquo;[Dagger] to the Publick is a proof how this great man could embellish, with the graces of superiour composition, even so trite a thing as the plan of a magazine.</p>
<p class="p24">His original essays are, &lsquo;An Introduction to the Political State of Great Britain;&rsquo;[Dagger] &lsquo;Remarks on the Militia Bill;&rsquo;[Dagger] &lsquo;Observations on his Britannick Majesty&rsquo;s Treaties with the Empress of Russia and the Landgrave of Hesse Cassel;&rsquo;[Dagger] &lsquo;Observations on the Present State of Affairs;&rsquo;[Dagger] and &lsquo;Memoirs of Frederick III, King of Prussia.&rsquo;[Dagger] In all these he displays extensive political knowledge and sagacity, expressed with uncommon energy and perspicuity, without any of those words which he sometimes took a pleasure in adopting in imitation of Sir Thomas Browne; of whose <span class="t8">Christian Morals</span> he this year gave an edition, with his &lsquo;Life&rsquo;[*] prefixed to it, which is one of Johnson&rsquo;s best biographical performances. In one instance only in these essays has he indulged his <span class="t8">Brownism</span>. Dr. Robertson, the historian, mentioned it to me, as having at once convinced him that Johnson was the author of the &lsquo;Memoirs of the King of Prussia.&rsquo; Speaking of the pride which the old King, the father of his hero, took in being master of the tallest regiment in Europe, he says, &lsquo;To review this towering regiment was his daily pleasure; and to perpetuate it was so much his care, that when he met a tall woman he immediately commanded one of his <span class="t8">Titanian</span> retinue to marry her, that they might <span class="t8">propagate procerity</span>&rsquo; For this Anglo-Latian word <span class="t8">procerity</span>, Johnson had, however, the authority of Addison.</p>
<p class="p24">His reviews are of the following books: &lsquo;Birch&rsquo;s History of the Royal Society;&rsquo;[Dagger] &lsquo;Murphy&rsquo;s Gray&rsquo;s Inn Journal;&rsquo;[Dagger] &lsquo;Warton&rsquo;s Essay on the Writings and Genius of Pope, Vol. I.&rsquo;[Dagger] &lsquo;Hampton&rsquo;s Translation of Polybius;&rsquo;[Dagger] &lsquo;Blackwell&rsquo;s Memoirs of the Court of Augustus;&rsquo;[Dagger] &lsquo;Russel&rsquo;s Natural History of Aleppo;&rsquo;[Dagger] &lsquo;Sir Isaac Newton&rsquo;s Arguments in Proof of a Deity;&rsquo;[Dagger] &lsquo;Borlase&rsquo;s History of the Isles of Scilly;&rsquo;[Dagger] &lsquo;Home&rsquo;s Experiments on Bleaching;&rsquo;[Dagger] &lsquo;Browne&rsquo;s Christian Morals;&rsquo;[Dagger] &lsquo;Hales on Distilling Sea-Water, Ventilators in Ships, and curing an ill Taste in Milk;&rsquo;[Dagger] &lsquo;Lucas&rsquo;s Essay on Waters;&rsquo;[Dagger] &lsquo;Keith&rsquo;s Catalogue of the Scottish Bishops;&rsquo;[Dagger] &lsquo;Browne&rsquo;s History of Jamaica;&rsquo;[Dagger] &lsquo;Philosophical Transactions, Vol. XLIX.&rsquo;[Dagger] &lsquo;Mrs. Lennox&rsquo;s Translation of Sully&rsquo;s Memoirs;&rsquo;[*] &lsquo;Miscellanies by Elizabeth Harrison;&rsquo;[Dagger] &lsquo;Evans&rsquo;s Map and Account of the Middle Colonies in America;&rsquo;[Dagger] &lsquo;Letter on the Case of Admiral Byng;&rsquo;[*] &lsquo;Appeal to the People concerning Admiral Byng;&rsquo;[*] &lsquo;Hanway&rsquo;s Eight Days Journey, and Essay on Tea;&rsquo;[*] &lsquo;The Cadet, a Military Treatise;&rsquo;[Dagger] &lsquo;Some further Particulars in Relation to the Case of Admiral Byng, by a Gentleman of Oxford;&rsquo;[*] &lsquo;The Conduct of the Ministry relating to the present War impartially examined;&rsquo;[Dagger] &lsquo;A Free Inquiry into the Nature and Origin of Evil.&rsquo;[*] All these, from internal evidence, were written by Johnson; some of them I know he avowed, and have marked them with an <span class="t8">asterisk</span> accordingly.</p>
<p class="p26">Mr. Thomas Davies indeed, ascribed to him the Review of Mr. Burke&rsquo;s<br/>&lsquo;Inquiry into the Origin of our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful;&rsquo; and<br/>Sir John Hawkins, with equal discernment, has inserted it in his<br/>collection of Johnson&rsquo;s works: whereas it has no resemblance to<br/>Johnson&rsquo;s composition, and is well known to have been written by Mr.<br/>Murphy, who has acknowledged it to me and many others.</p>
<p class="p24">It is worthy of remark, in justice to Johnson&rsquo;s political character, which has been misrepresented as abjectly submissive to power, that his &lsquo;Observations on the present State of Affairs&rsquo; glow with as animated a spirit of constitutional liberty as can be found any where. Thus he begins:</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The time is now come, in which every Englishman expects to be informed of the national affairs; and in which he has a right to have that expectation gratified. For, whatever may be urged by Ministers, or those whom vanity or interest make the followers of ministers, concerning the necessity of confidence in our governours, and the presumption of prying with profane eyes into the recesses of policy, it is evident that this reverence can be claimed only by counsels yet unexecuted, and projects suspended in deliberation. But when a design has ended in miscarriage or success, when every eye and every ear is witness to general discontent, or general satisfaction, it is then a proper time to disentangle confusion and illustrate obscurity; to shew by what causes every event was produced, and in what effects it is likely to terminate; to lay down with distinct particularity what rumour always huddles in general exclamation, or perplexes by indigested narratives; to shew whence happiness or calamity is derived, and whence it may be expected; and honestly to lay before the people what inquiry can gather of the past, and conjecture can estimate of the future&rsquo;.</p>
<p class="p24">Here we have it assumed as an incontrovertible principle, that in this country the people are the superintendants of the conduct and measures of those by whom government is administered; of the beneficial effect of which the present reign afforded an illustrious example, when addresses from all parts of the kingdom controuled an audacious attempt to introduce a new power subversive of the crown.</p>
<p class="p24">A still stronger proof of his patriotick spirit appears in his review of an &lsquo;Essay on Waters, by Dr. Lucas;&rsquo; of whom, after describing him as a man well known to the world for his daring defiance of power, when he thought it exerted on the side of wrong, he thus speaks:</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The Irish ministers drove him from his native country by a proclamation, in which they charged him with crimes of which they never intended to be called to the proof, and oppressed by methods equally irresistible by guilt and innocence.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Let the man thus driven into exile, for having been the friend of his country, be received in every other place as a confessor of liberty; and let the tools of power be taught in time, that they may rob, but cannot impoverish.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Some of his reviews in this <span class="t8">Magazine</span> are very short accounts of the pieces noticed, and I mention them only that Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s opinion of the works may be known; but many of them are examples of elaborate criticism, in the most masterly style. In his review of the &lsquo;Memoirs of the Court of Augustus,&rsquo; he has the resolution to think and speak from his own mind, regardless of the cant transmitted from age to age, in praise of the ancient Romans. Thus,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I know not why any one but a school-boy in his declamation should whine over the Common-wealth of Rome, which grew great only by the misery of the rest of mankind. The Romans, like others, as soon as they grew rich, grew corrupt; and in their corruption sold the lives and freedoms of themselves, and of one another.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Again,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;A people, who, while they were poor, robbed mankind; and as soon as they became rich, robbed one another.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">In his review of the <span class="t8">Miscellanies</span> in prose and verse, published by Elizabeth Harrison, but written by many hands, he gives an eminent proof at once of his orthodoxy and candour:</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The authours of the essays in prose seem generally to have imitated, or tried to imitate, the copiousness and luxuriance of Mrs. Rowe, This, however, is not all their praise; they have laboured to add to her brightness of imagery, her purity of sentiments. The poets have had Dr. <span class="t8">Watts</span> before their eyes; a writer, who, if he stood not in the first class of genius, compensated that defect by a ready application of his powers to the promotion of piety. The attempt to employ the ornaments of romance in the decoration of religion, was, I think, first made by Mr. <span class="t8">Boyle&rsquo;s Martyrdom of Theodora</span>; but <span class="t8">Boyle&rsquo;s</span> philosophical studies did not allow him time for the cultivation of style; and the Completion of the great design was reserved for Mrs. <span class="t8">Rowe</span>. Dr. <span class="t8">Watts</span> was one of the first who taught the Dissenters to write and speak like other men, by shewing them that elegance might consist with piety. They would have both done honour to a better society, for they had that charity which might well make their failings be forgotten, and with which the whole Christian world might wish for communion. They were pure from all the heresies of an age, to which every opinion is become a favourite that the universal church has hitherto detested!</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;This praise, the general interest of mankind requires to be given to writers who please and do not corrupt, who instruct and do not weary. But to them all human eulogies are vain, whom I believe applauded by angels, and numbered with the just.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">His defence of tea against Mr. Jonas Hartway&rsquo;s violent attack upon that elegant and popular beverage, shews how very well a man of genius can write upon the slightest subject, when he writes, as the Italians say, <span class="t8">con amore</span>: I suppose no person ever enjoyed with more relish the infusion of that fragrant leaf than Johnson. The quantities which he drank of it at all hours were so great, that his nerves must have been uncommonly strong, not to have been extremely relaxed by such an intemperate use of it. He assured me, that he never felt the least inconvenience from it; which is a proof that the fault of his constitution was rather a too great tension of fibres, than the contrary. Mr. Hanway wrote an angry answer to Johnson&rsquo;s review of his <span class="t8">Essay on Tea</span>, and Johnson, after a full and deliberate pause, made a reply to it; the only instance, I believe, in the whole course of his life, when he condescended to oppose any thing that was written against him. I suppose when he thought of any of his little antagonists, he was ever justly aware of the high sentiment of Ajax in <span class="t8">Ovid</span>:</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;Iste tulit pretium jam nunc certaminis hujus,<br/>Qui, cùm victus erit, mecum certasse feretur.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p26">But, indeed, the good Mr. Hanway laid himself so open to ridicule, that<br/>Johnson&rsquo;s animadversions upon his attack were chiefly to make sport.</p>
<p class="p24">The generosity with which he pleads the cause of Admiral Byng is highly to the honour of his heart and spirit. Though <span class="t8">Voltaire</span> affects to be witty upon the fate of that unfortunate officer, observing that he was shot &lsquo;<span class="t8">pour encourager les autres</span>,&rsquo; the nation has long been satisfied that his life was sacrificed to the political fervour of the times. In the vault belonging to the Torrington family, in the church of Southill, in Bedfordshire, there is the following Epitaph upon his monument, which I have transcribed:</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">&lsquo;TO THE PERPETUAL DISGRACE OF PUBLIC JUSTICE, THE HONOURABLE JOHN BYNG, ESQ. ADMIRAL OF THE BLUE, FELL A MARTYR TO POLITICAL PERSECUTION, MARCH 14, IN THE YEAR, 1757; WHEN BRAVERY AND LOYALTY WERE INSUFFICIENT SECURITIES FOR THE LIFE AND HONOUR OF A NAVAL OFFICER.&rsquo;</span></p>
<p class="p21">Johnson&rsquo;s most exquisite critical essay in the <span class="t8">Literary Magazine</span>, and indeed any where, is his review of Soame Jenyns&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Inquiry into the Origin of Evil</span>. Jenyns was possessed of lively talents, and a style eminently pure and easy, and could very happily play with a light subject, either in prose or verse; but when he speculated on that most difficult and excruciating question, the Origin of Evil, he ventured far beyond his depth, and, accordingly, was exposed by Johnson, both with acute argument and brilliant wit. I remember when the late Mr. Bicknell&rsquo;s humourous performance, entitled <span class="t8">The Musical Travels of Joel Collyer</span>, in which a slight attempt is made to ridicule Johnson, was ascribed to Soame Jenyns, &lsquo;Ha! (said Johnson) I thought I had given him enough of it.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">His triumph over Jenyns is thus described by my friend Mr. Courtenay in his <span class="t8">Poetical Review of the literary and moral Character of Dr. Johnson</span>; a performance of such merit, that had I not been honoured with a very kind and partial notice in it, I should echo the sentiments of men of the first taste loudly in its praise:</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;When specious sophists with presumption scan<br/>The source of evil hidden still from man;<br/>Revive Arabian tales, and vainly hope<br/>To rival St. John, and his scholar Pope:<br/>Though metaphysicks spread the gloom of night,<br/>By reason&rsquo;s star he guides our aching sight;<br/>The bounds of knowledge marks, and points the way<br/>To pathless wastes, where wilder&rsquo;d sages stray;<br/>Where, like a farthing link-boy, Jenyns stands,<br/>And the dim torch drops from his feeble hands.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">This year Mr. William Payne, brother of the respectable Bookseller of that name, published <span class="t8">An Introduction to the Game of Draughts</span>, to which Johnson contributed a Dedication to the Earl of Rochford,[*] and a Preface,[*] both of which are admirably adapted to the treatise to which they are prefixed. Johnson, I believe, did not play at draughts after leaving College, by which he suffered; for it would have afforded him an innocent soothing relief from the melancholy which distressed him so often. I have heard him regret that he had not learnt to play at cards; and the game of draughts we know is peculiarly calculated to fix the attention without straining it. There is a composure and gravity in draughts which insensibly tranquillises the mind; and, accordingly, the Dutch are fond of it, as they are of smoaking, of the sedative influence of which, though he himself never smoaked, he had a high opinion. Besides, there is in draughts some exercise of the faculties; and, accordingly, Johnson wishing to dignify the subject in his Dedication with what is most estimable in it, observes,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Triflers may find or make any thing a trifle; but since it is the great characteristick of a wise man to see events in their courses, to obviate consequences, and ascertain contingencies, your Lordship will think nothing a trifle by which the mind is inured to caution, foresight, and circumspection.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">As one of the little occasional advantages which he did not disdain to take by his pen, as a man whose profession was literature, he this year accepted of a guinea from Mr. Robert Dodsley, for writing the introduction to <span class="t8">The London Chronicle</span>, an evening news-paper; and even in so slight a performance exhibited peculiar talents. This Chronicle still subsists, and from what I observed, when I was abroad, has a more extensive circulation upon the Continent than any of the English newspapers. It was constantly read by Johnson himself; and it is but just to observe, that it has all along been distinguished for good sense, accuracy, moderation, and delicacy.</p>
<p class="p24">Another instance of the same nature has been communicated to me by the Reverend Dr. Thomas Campbell, who has done himself considerable credit by his own writings.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Sitting with Dr. Johnson one morning alone, he asked me if I had known Dr. Madden, who was authour of the premium-scheme in Ireland. On my answering in the affirmative, and also that I had for some years lived in his neighbourhood, &amp;c., he begged of me that when I returned to Ireland, I would endeavour to procure for him a poem of Dr. Madden&rsquo;s called <span class="t8">Boulter&rsquo;s Monument</span>. The reason (said he) why I wish for it, is this: when Dr. Madden came to London, he submitted that work to my castigation; and I remember I blotted a great many lines, and might have blotted many more, without making the poem worse. However, the Doctor was very thankful, and very generous, for he gave me ten guineas, <span class="t8">which was to me at that time a great sum</span>.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He this year resumed his scheme of giving an edition of <span class="t8">Shakspeare</span> with notes. He issued Proposals of considerable length,[*] in which he shewed that he perfectly well knew what a variety of research such an undertaking required; but his indolence prevented him from pursuing it with that diligence which alone can collect those scattered facts that genius, however acute, penetrating, and luminous, cannot discover by its own force. It is remarkable, that at this time his fancied activity was for the moment so vigorous, that he promised his work should be published before Christmas, 1757. Yet nine years elapsed before it saw the light. His throes in bringing it forth had been severe and remittent; and at last we may almost conclude that the Caesarian operation was performed by the knife of Churchill, whose upbraiding satire, I dare say, made Johnson&rsquo;s friends urge him to dispatch,</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;He for subscribers bates his hook,<br/>And takes your cash; but where&rsquo;s the book?<br/>No matter where; wise fear, you know,<br/>Forbids the robbing of a foe;<br/>But what, to serve our private ends,<br/>Forbids the cheating of our friends?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">About this period he was offered a living of considerable value in Lincolnshire, if he were inclined to enter into holy orders. It was a rectory in the gift of Mr. Langton, the father of his much valued friend. But he did not accept of it; partly I believe from a conscientious motive, being persuaded that his temper and habits rendered him unfit for that assiduous and familiar instruction of the vulgar and ignorant which he held to be an essential duty in a clergyman; and partly because his love of a London life was so strong, that he would have thought himself an exile in any other place, particularly if residing in the country. Whoever would wish to see his thoughts upon that subject displayed in their full force, may peruse <span class="t8">The Adventurer</span>, Number 126.</p>
<p class="p24">1757: ÆTAT. 48.]. &mdash; In 1757 it does not appear that he published any thing, except some of those articles in <span class="t8">The Literary Magazine</span>, which have been mentioned. That magazine, after Johnson ceased to write in it, gradually declined, though the popular epithet of <span class="t8">Antigallican</span> was added to it; and in July 1758 it expired. He probably prepared a part of his <span class="t8">Shakspeare</span> this year, and he dictated a speech on the subject of an Address to the Throne, after the expedition to Rochfort, which was delivered by one of his friends, I know not in what publick meeting. It is printed in <span class="t8">The Gentleman&rsquo;s Magazine</span> for October 1785 as his, and bears sufficient marks of authenticity.</p>
<p class="p24">By the favour of Mr. Joseph Cooper Walker, of the Treasury, Dublin, I have obtained a copy of the following letter from Johnson to the venerable authour of <span class="t8">Dissertations on the History of Ireland</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To CHARLES O&rsquo;CONNOR, ESQ.</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I have lately, by the favour of Mr. Faulkner, seen your account of Ireland, and cannot forbear to solicit a prosecution of your design. Sir William Temple complains that Ireland is less known than any other country, as to its ancient state. The natives have had little leisure, and little encouragement for enquiry; and strangers, not knowing the language, have had no ability.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I have long wished that the Irish literature were cultivated. Ireland is known by tradition to have been once the seat of piety and learning; and surely it would be very acceptable to all those who are curious either in the original of nations, or the affinities of languages, to be further informed of the revolution of a people so ancient, and once so illustrious.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;What relation there is between the Welch and Irish language, or between the language of Ireland and that of Biscay, deserves enquiry. Of these provincial and unextended tongues, it seldom happens that more than one are understood by any one man; and, therefore, it seldom happens that a fair comparison can be made. I hope you will continue to cultivate this kind of learning, which has too long lain neglected, and which, if it be suffered to remain in oblivion for another century, may, perhaps, never be retrieved. As I wish well to all useful undertakings, I would not forbear to let you know how much you deserve in my opinion, from all lovers of study, and how much pleasure your work has given to, Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your most obliged,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;And most humble servant,</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;London, April 9, 1757.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To THE REVEREND MR. THOMAS WARTON.</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Dr. Marsili of Padua, a learned gentleman, and good Latin poet, has a mind to see Oxford. I have given him a letter to Dr. Huddesford, and shall be glad if you will introduce him, and shew him any thing in Oxford.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am printing my new edition of <span class="t8">Shakspeare</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I long to see you all, but cannot conveniently come yet. You might write to me now and then, if you were good for any thing. But <span class="t8">honores mulant mores</span>. Professors forget their friends. I shall certainly complain to Miss Jones. I am,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your, &amp;c.</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;[London,] June 21, 1757.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Please to make my compliments to Mr. Wise.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Mr. Burney having enclosed to him an extract from the review of his <span class="t8">Dictionary</span> in the Bibliothèque des Savans, and a list of subscribers to his <span class="t8">Shakspeare</span>, which Mr. Burney had procured in Norfolk, he wrote the following answer:</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To MR. BURNEY, IN LYNNE, NORFOLK.</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;That I may shew myself sensible of your favours, and not commit the same fault a second time, I make haste to answer the letter which I received this morning. The truth is, the other likewise was received, and I wrote an answer; but being desirous to transmit you some proposals and receipts, I waited till I could find a convenient conveyance, and day was passed after day, till other things drove it from my thoughts; yet not so, but that I remember with great pleasure your commendation of my <span class="t8">Dictionary</span>. Your praise was welcome, not only because I believe it was sincere, but because praise has been very scarce. A man of your candour will be surprised when I tell you, that among all my acquaintance there were only two, who upon the publication of my book did not endeavour to depress me with threats of censure from the publick, or with objections learned from those who had learned them from my own Preface. Your&rsquo;s is the only letter of goodwill that I have received; though, indeed, I am promised something of that sort from Sweden.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;How my new edition will be received I know not; the subscription has not been very successful. I shall publish about March.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;If you can direct me how to send proposals, I should wish that they were in such hands.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I remember, Sir, in some of the first letters with which you favoured me, you mentioned your lady. May I enquire after her? In return for the favours which you have shewn me, it is not much to tell you, that I wish you and her all that can conduce to your happiness.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am, Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your most obliged,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;And most humble servant,</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Gough-square, Dec. 24, 1757.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">In 1758 we find him, it should seem, in as easy and pleasant a state of existence, as constitutional unhappiness ever permitted him to enjoy.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To BENNET LANGTON, ESQ., AT LANGTON, LINCOLNSHIRE.</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">&lsquo;DEAREST SIR,</span></p>
<p class="p21">&lsquo;I must indeed have slept very fast, not to have been awakened by your letter. None of your suspicions are true; I am not much richer than when you left me; and, what is worse, my omission of an answer to your first letter, will prove that I am not much wiser. But I go on as I formerly did, designing to be some time or other both rich and wise; and yet cultivate neither mind nor fortune. Do you take notice of my example, and learn the danger of delay. When I was as you are now, towering in the confidence of twenty-one, little did I suspect that I should be at forty-nine, what I now am.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;But you do not seem to need my admonition. You are busy in acquiring and in communicating knowledge, and while you are studying, enjoy the end of study, by making others wiser and happier. I was much pleased with the tale that you told me of being tutour to your sisters. I, who have no sisters nor brothers, look with some degree of innocent envy on those who may be said to be born to friends; and cannot see, without wonder, how rarely that native union is afterwards regarded. It sometimes, indeed, happens, that some supervenient cause of discord may overpower this original amity; but it seems to me more frequently thrown away with levity, or lost by negligence, than destroyed by injury or violence. We tell the ladies that good wives make good husbands; I believe it is a more certain position that good brothers make good sisters.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am satisfied with your stay at home, as Juvenal with his friend&rsquo;s retirement to Cumæ: I know that your absence is best, though it be not best for me.</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;Quamvis digressu veteris confusus amici,<br/>Laudo tamen vacuis quod sedem figere Cumis<br/>Destinet, atque unum civem donare Sibyllæ.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;<span class="t8">Langton</span> is a good Cumæ, but who must be Sibylla? Mrs. Langton is as wise as Sibyl, and as good; and will live, if my wishes can prolong life, till she shall in time be as old. But she differs in this, that she has not scattered her precepts in the wind, at least not those which she bestowed upon you.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The two Wartons just looked into the town, and were taken to see <span class="t8">Cleone</span>, where, David says, they were starved for want of company to keep them warm. David and Doddy have had a new quarrel, and, I think, cannot conveniently quarrel any more. <span class="t8">Cleone</span> was well acted by all the characters, but Bellamy left nothing to be desired. I went the first night, and supported it, as well as I might; for Doddy, you know, is my patron, and I would not desert him. The play was very well received. Doddy, after the danger was over, went every night to the stage-side, and cried at the distress of poor Cleone.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I have left off housekeeping, and therefore made presents of the game which you were pleased to send me. The pheasant I gave to Mr. Richardson, the bustard to Dr. Lawrence, and the pot I placed with Miss Williams, to be eaten by myself. She desires that her compliments and good wishes may be accepted by the family; and I make the same request for myself.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Mr. Reynolds has within these few days raised his price to twenty guineas a head, and Miss is much employed in miniatures. I know not any body [else] whose prosperity has encreased since you left them.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Murphy is to have his <span class="t8">Orphan of China</span> acted next month; and is therefore, I suppose, happy. I wish I could tell you of any great good to which I was approaching, but at present my prospects do not much delight me; however, I am always pleased when I find that you, dear Sir, remember,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your affectionate, humble servant,</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Jan. 9, 1758.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">&lsquo;TO MR. BURNEY, AT LYNNE, NORFOLK.</span></p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your kindness is so great, and my claim to any particular regard from you so little, that I am at a loss how to express my sense of your favours; but I am, indeed, much pleased to be thus distinguished by you.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am ashamed to tell you that my <span class="t8">Shakspeare</span> will not be out so soon as I promised my subscribers; but I did not promise them more than I promised myself. It will, however, be published before summer.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I have sent you a bundle of proposals, which, I think, do not profess more than I have hitherto performed. I have printed many of the plays, and have hitherto left very few passages unexplained; where I am quite at a loss, I confess my ignorance, which is seldom done by commentators.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I have, likewise, enclosed twelve receipts; not that I mean to impose upon you the trouble of pushing them, with more importunity than may seem proper, but that you may rather have more than fewer than you shall want. The proposals you will disseminate as there shall be an opportunity. I once printed them at length in the <span class="t8">Chronicle</span>, and some of my friends (I believe Mr. Murphy, who formerly wrote the <span class="t8">Gray&rsquo;s-Inn Journal</span>) introduced them with a splendid encomium.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Since the <span class="t8">Life of Browne</span>, I have been a little engaged, from time to time, in the <span class="t8">Literary Magazine</span>, but not very lately. I have not the collection by me, and therefore cannot draw out a catalogue of my own parts, but will do it, and send it. Do not buy them, for I will gather all those that have anything of mine in them, and send them to Mrs. Burney, as a small token of gratitude for the regard which she is pleased to bestow upon me.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am, Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your most obliged</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;And most humble servant,</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;London, March 8, 1758.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Dr. Burney has kindly favoured me with the following memorandum, which I take the liberty to insert in his own genuine easy style. I love to exhibit sketches of my illustrious friend by various eminent hands.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Soon after this, Mr. Burney, during a visit to the capital, had an interview with him in Gough-square, where he dined and drank tea with him, and was introduced to the acquaintance of Mrs. Williams. After dinner, Mr. Johnson proposed to Mr. Burney to go up with him into his garret, which being accepted, he there found about five or six Greek folios, a deal writing-desk, and a chair and a half. Johnson giving to his guest the entire seat, tottered himself on one with only three legs and one arm. Here he gave Mr. Burney Mrs. Williams&rsquo;s history, and shewed him some volumes of his <span class="t8">Shakspeare</span> already printed, to prove that he was in earnest. Upon Mr. Burney&rsquo;s opening the first volume, at the <span class="t8">Merchant of Venice</span>, he observed to him, that he seemed to be more severe on Warburton than Theobald. &ldquo;O poor Tib.! (said Johnson) he was ready knocked down to my hands; Warburton stands between me and him.&rdquo; &ldquo;But, Sir, (said Mr. Burney,) you&rsquo;ll have Warburton upon your bones, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; &ldquo;No, Sir; he&rsquo;ll not come out: he&rsquo;ll only growl in his den.&rdquo; &ldquo;But you think, Sir, that Warburton is a superiour critick to Theobald?&rdquo; &ldquo;O, Sir, he&rsquo;d make two-and-fifty Theobalds, cut into slices! The worst of Warburton is, that he has a rage for saying something, when there&rsquo;s nothing to be said.&rdquo; Mr. Burney then asked him whether he had seen the letter which Warburton had written in answer to a pamphlet addressed &ldquo;To the most impudent Man alive.&rdquo; He answered in the negative. Mr. Burney told him it was supposed to be written by Mallet. The controversy now raged between the friends of Pope and Bolingbroke; and Warburton and Mallet were the leaders of the several parties.</p>
<p class="p24">Mr. Burney asked him then if he had seen Warburton&rsquo;s book against Bolingbroke&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Philosophy</span>? &ldquo;No, Sir, I have never read Bolingbroke&rsquo;s impiety, and therefore am not interested about its confutation.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On the fifteenth of April he began a new periodical paper, entitled <span class="t8">The Idler</span>,[*] which came out every Saturday in a weekly news-paper, called <span class="t8">The Universal Chronicle, or Weekly Gazette</span>, published by Newbery. These essays were continued till April 5, 1760. Of one hundred and three, their total number, twelve were contributed by his friends; of which, Numbers 33, 93, and 96, were written by Mr. Thomas Warton; No. 67 by Mr. Langton; and Nos. 76, 79, and 82, by Sir Joshua Reynolds; the concluding words of No. 82, &lsquo;and pollute his canvas with deformity,&rsquo; being added by Johnson, as Sir Joshua informed me.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">The Idler</span> is evidently the work of the same mind which produced <span class="t8">The Rambler</span>, but has less body and more spirit. It has more variety of real life, and greater facility of language. He describes the miseries of idleness, with the lively sensations of one who has felt them; and in his private memorandums while engaged in it, we find &lsquo;This year I hope to learn diligence.&rsquo; Many of these excellent essays were written as hastily as an ordinary letter. Mr. Langton remembers Johnson, when on a visit at Oxford, asking him one evening how long it was till the post went out; and on being told about half an hour, he exclaimed, &lsquo;then we shall do very well.&rsquo; He upon this instantly sat down and finished an <span class="t8">Idler</span>, which it was necessary should be in London the next day. Mr. Langton having signified a wish to read it, &lsquo;Sir, (said he) you shall not do more than I have done myself.&rsquo; He then folded it up and sent it off.</p>
<p class="p24">Yet there are in <span class="t8">The Idler</span> several papers which shew as much profundity of thought, and labour of language, as any of this great man&rsquo;s writings. No. 14, &lsquo;Robbery of Time;&rsquo; No. 24, &lsquo;Thinking;&rsquo; No. 41, &lsquo;Death of a Friend;&rsquo; No. 43, &lsquo;Flight of Time;&rsquo; No. 51, &lsquo;Domestick greatness unattainable;&rsquo; No. 52, &lsquo;Self-denial;&rsquo; No. 58, &lsquo;Actual, how short of fancied, excellence;&rsquo; No. 89, &lsquo;Physical evil moral goode;&rsquo; and his concluding paper on &lsquo;The horrour of the last;&rsquo; will prove this assertion. I know not why a motto, the usual trapping of periodical papers, is prefixed to very few of the <span class="t8">Idlers</span>, as I have heard Johnson commend the custom: and he never could be at a loss for one, his memory being stored with innumerable passages of the classicks. In this series of essays he exhibits admirable instances of grave humour, of which he had an uncommon share. Nor on some occasions has he repressed that power of sophistry which he possessed in so eminent a degree. In No. 11, he treats with the utmost contempt the opinion that our mental faculties depend, in some degree, upon the weather; an opinion, which they who have never experienced its truth are not to be envied; and of which he himself could not but be sensible, as the effects of weather upon him were very visible. Yet thus he declaims: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Surely, nothing is more reproachful to a being endowed with reason, than to resign its powers to the influence of the air, and live in dependence on the weather and the wind for the only blessings which nature has put into our power, tranquillity and benevolence. This distinction of seasons is produced only by imagination operating on luxury. To temperance, every day is bright; and every hour is propitious to diligence. He that shall resolutely excite his faculties, or exert his virtues, will soon make himself superiour to the seasons; and may set at defiance the morning mist and the evening damp, the blasts of the east, and the clouds of the south.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I think the Romans call it Stoicism.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">But in this number of his <span class="t8">Idler</span> his spirits seem to run riot; for in the wantonness of his disquisition he forgets, for a moment, even the reverence for that which he held in high respect; and describes &lsquo;the attendant on a <span class="t8">Court</span>,&rsquo; as one &lsquo;whose business, is to watch the looks of a being, weak and foolish as himself.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Alas! it is too certain, that where the frame has delicate fibres, and there is a fine sensibility, such influences of the air are irresistible. He might as well have bid defiance to the ague, the palsy, and all other bodily disorders, Such boasting of the mind is false elevation.</p>
<p class="p24">His unqualified ridicule of rhetorical gesture or action is not, surely, a test of truth; yet we cannot help admiring how well it is adapted to produce the effect which he wished. &lsquo;Neither the judges of our laws, nor the representatives of our people, would be much affected by laboured gesticulation, or believe any man the more because he rolled his eyes, or puffed his cheeks, or spread abroad his arms, or stamped the ground, or thumped his breast; or turned his eyes sometimes to the ceiling, and sometimes to the floor.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">A casual coincidence with other writers, or an adoption of a sentiment or image which has been found in the writings of another, and afterwards appears in the mind as one&rsquo;s own, is not unfrequent. The richness of Johnson&rsquo;s fancy, which could supply his page abundantly on all occasions, and the strength of his memory, which at once detected the real owner of any thought, made him less liable to the imputation of plagiarism than, perhaps, any of our writers. In <span class="t8">The Idler</span>, however, there is a paper, in which conversation is assimilated to a bowl of punch, where there is the same train of comparison as in a poem by Blacklock, in his collection published in 1756, in which a parallel is ingeniously drawn between human life and that liquor. It ends, &mdash; </p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;Say, then, physicians of each kind,<br/>Who cure the body or the mind,<br/>What harm in drinking can there be,<br/>Since punch and life so well agree?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">To <span class="t8">The Idler</span>, when collected in volumes, he added, beside the &lsquo;Essay on Epitaphs&rsquo; and the &lsquo;Dissertation on those of Pope,&rsquo; an Essay on the &lsquo;Bravery of the English common Soldiers.&rsquo; He, however, omitted one of the original papers, which in the folio copy is No. 22.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To THE REVEREND MR. THOMAS WARTON.</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your notes upon my poet were very acceptable. I beg that you will be so kind as to continue your searches. It will be reputable to my work, and suitable to your professorship, to have something of yours in the notes. As you have given no directions about your name, I shall therefore put it. I wish your brother would take the same trouble. A commentary must arise from the fortuitous discoveries of many men in devious walks of literature. Some of your remarks are on plays already printed: but I purpose to add an Appendix of Notes, so that nothing comes too late.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;You give yourself too much uneasiness, dear Sir, about the loss of the papers. The loss is nothing, if nobody has found them; nor even then, perhaps, if the numbers be known. You are not the only friend that has had the same mischance. You may repair your want out of a stock, which is deposited with Mr. Allen, of Magdalen-Hall; or out of a parcel which I have just sent to Mr. Chambers for the use of any body that will be so kind as to want them. Mr. Langtons are well; and Miss Roberts, whom I have at last brought to speak, upon the information which you gave me, that she had something to say.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am, &amp;c.</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;[London] April 14, 1758.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">&lsquo;TO THE SAME.</span></p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;You will receive this by Mr. Baretti, a gentleman particularly intitled to the notice and kindness of the Professor of poesy. He has time but for a short stay, and will be glad to have it filled up with as much as he can hear and see.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;In recommending another to your favour, I ought not to omit thanks for the kindness which you have shewn to myself. Have you any more notes on Shakspeare? I shall be glad of them.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I see your pupil sometimes: his mind is as exalted as his stature. I am half afraid of him; but he is no less amiable than formidable. He will, if the forwardness of his spring be not blasted, be a credit to you, and to the University. He brings some of my plays with him, which he has my permission to shew you, on condition you will hide them from every body else.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am, dear Sir, &amp;c.</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;[London,] June 1, 1758.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To BENNET LANGTON, ESQ., OF TRINITY COLLEGE, OXFORD.</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Though I might have expected to hear from you, upon your entrance into a new state of life at a new place, yet recollecting, (not without some degree of shame,) that I owe you a letter upon an old account, I think it my part to write first. This, indeed, I do not only from complaisance but from interest; for living on in the old way, I am very glad of a correspondent so capable as yourself, to diversify the hours. You have, at present, too many novelties about you to need any help from me to drive along your time.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I know not any thing more pleasant, or more instructive, than to compare experience with expectation, or to register from time to time the difference between idea and reality. It is by this kind of observation that we grow daily less liable to be disappointed. You, who are very capable of anticipating futurity, and raising phantoms before your own eyes, must often have imagined to yourself an academical life, and have conceived what would be the manners, the views, and the conversation, of men devoted to letters; how they would choose their companions, how they would direct their studies, and how they would regulate their lives. Let me know what you expected, and what you have found. At least record it to yourself before custom has reconciled you to the scenes before you, and the disparity of your discoveries to your hopes has vanished from your mind. It is a rule never to be forgotten, that whatever strikes strongly, should be described while the first impression remains fresh upon the mind.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I love, dear Sir, to think on you, and therefore, should willingly write more to you, but that the post will not now give me leave to do more than send my compliments to Mr. Warton, and tell you that I am, dear Sir, most affectionately,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your very humble servant,</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;June 28, 1757.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">&lsquo;TO BENNET LANGTON, ESQ., AT LANGTON, NEAR SPILSBY, LINCOLNSHIRE.</span></p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I should be sorry to think that what engrosses the attention of my friend, should have no part of mine. Your mind is now full of the fate of Dury; but his fate is past, and nothing remains but to try what reflection will suggest to mitigate the terrours of a violent death, which is more formidable at the first glance, than on a nearer and more steady view. A violent death is never very painful; the only danger is lest it should be unprovided. But if a man can be supposed to make no provision for death in war, what can be the state that would have awakened him to the care of futurity? When would that man have prepared himself to die, who went to seek death without preparation? What then can be the reason why we lament more him that dies of a wound, than him that dies of a fever? A man that languishes with disease, ends his life with more pain, but with less virtue; he leaves no example to his friends, nor bequeaths any honour to his descendants. The only reason why we lament a soldier&rsquo;s death, is, that we think he might have lived longer; yet this cause of grief is common to many other kinds of death which are not so passionately bewailed. The truth is, that every death is violent which is the effect of accident; every death, which is not gradually brought on by the miseries of age, or when life is extinguished for any other reason than that it is burnt out. He that dies before sixty, of a cold or consumption, dies, in reality, by a violent death; yet his death is borne with patience only because the cause of his untimely end is silent and invisible. Let us endeavour to see things as they are, and then enquire whether we ought to complain. Whether to see life as it is, will give us much consolation, I know not; but the consolation which is drawn from truth, if any there be, is solid and durable; that which may be derived from errour must be, like its original, fallacious and fugitive. I am, dear, dear Sir, your most humble servant,</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Sept. 21, 1758.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">1759: ÆTAT. 50. &mdash; In 1759, in the month of January, his mother died at the great age of ninety, an event which deeply affected him; not that &lsquo;his mind had acquired no firmness by the contemplation of mortality;&rsquo; but that his reverential affection for her was not abated by years, as indeed he retained all his tender feelings even to the latest period of his life. I have been told that he regretted much his not having gone to visit his mother for several years, previous to her death. But he was constantly engaged in literary labours which confined him to London; and though he had not the comfort of seeing his aged parent, he contributed liberally to her support.</p>
<p class="p24">Soon after this event, he wrote his <span class="t8">Rasselas</span>, <span class="t8">Prince of Abyssinia</span>; concerning the publication of which Sir John Hawkins guesses vaguely and idly, instead of having taken the trouble to inform himself with authentick precision. Not to trouble my readers with a repetition of the Knight&rsquo;s reveries, I have to mention, that the late Mr. Strahan the printer told me, that Johnson wrote it, that with the profits he might defray the expence of his mother&rsquo;s funeral, and pay some little debts which she had left. He told Sir Joshua Reynolds that he composed it in the evenings of one week, sent it to the press in portions as it was written, and had never since read it over. Mr. Strahan, Mr. Johnston, and Mr. Dodsley purchased it for a hundred pounds, but afterwards paid him twenty-five pounds more, when it came to a second edition.</p>
<p class="p24">Considering the large sums which have been received for compilations, and works requiring not much more genius than compilations, we cannot but wonder at the very low price which he was content to receive for this admirable performance; which, though he had written nothing else, would have rendered his name immortal in the world of literature. None of his writings has been so extensively diffused over Europe; for it has been translated into most, if not all, of the modern languages. This Tale, with all the charms of oriental imagery, and all the force and beauty of which the English language is capable, leads us through the most important scenes of human life, and shews us that this stage of our being is full of &lsquo;vanity and vexation of spirit.&rsquo; To those who look no further than the present life, or who maintain that human nature has not fallen from the state in which it was created, the instruction of this sublime story will be of no avail. But they who think justly, and feel with strong sensibility, will listen with eagerness and admiration to its truth and wisdom. Voltaire&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Candide</span>, written to refute the system of Optimism, which it has accomplished with brilliant success, is wonderfully similar in its plan and conduct to Johnson&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Rasselas</span>; insomuch, that I have heard Johnson say, that if they had not been published so closely one after the other that there was not time for imitation, it would have been in vain to deny that the scheme of that which came latest was taken from the other. Though the proposition illustrated by both these works was the same, namely, that in our present state there is more evil than good, the intention of the writers was very different. Voltaire, I am afraid, meant only by wanton profaneness to obtain a sportive victory over religion, and to discredit the belief of a superintending Providence: Johnson meant, by shewing the unsatisfactory nature of things temporal, to direct the hopes of man to things eternal. <span class="t8">Rasselas</span>, as was observed to me by a very accomplished lady, may be considered as a more enlarged and more deeply philosophical discourse in prose, upon the interesting truth, which in his <span class="t8">Vanity of Human Wishes</span> he had so successfully enforced in verse.</p>
<p class="p24">The fund of thinking which this work contains is such, that almost every sentence of it may furnish a subject of long meditation. I am not satisfied if a year passes without my having read it through; and at every perusal, my admiration of the mind which produced it is so highly raised, that I can scarcely believe that I had the honour of enjoying the intimacy of such a man.</p>
<p class="p24">I restrain myself from quoting passages from this excellent work, or even referring to them, because I should not know what to select, or rather, what to omit. I shall, however, transcribe one, as it shews how well he could state the arguments of those who believe in the appearance of departed spirits; a doctrine which it is a mistake to suppose that he himself ever positively held:</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;If all your fear be of apparitions, (said the Prince,) I will promise you safety: there is no danger from the dead; he that is once buried will be seen no more.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;That the dead are seen no more, (said Imlac,) I will not undertake to maintain, against the concurrent and unvaried testimony of all ages, and of all nations. There is no people, rude or learned, among whom apparitions of the dead are not related and believed. This opinion, which prevails as far as human nature is diffused, could become universal only by its truth; those that never heard of one another, would not have agreed in a tale which nothing but experience can make credible. That it is doubted by single cavillers, can very little weaken the general evidence; and some who deny it with their tongues, confess it by their fears.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Notwithstanding my high admiration of <span class="t8">Rasselas</span>, I will not maintain that the &lsquo;morbid melancholy&rsquo; in Johnson&rsquo;s constitution may not, perhaps, have made life appear to him more insipid and unhappy than it generally is; for I am sure that he had less enjoyment from it than I have. Yet, whatever additional shade his own particular sensations may have thrown on his representation of life, attentive observation and close enquiry have convinced me, that there is too much of reality in the gloomy picture. The truth, however, is, that we judge of the happiness and misery of life differently at different times, according to the state of our changeable frame. I always remember a remark made to me by a Turkish lady, educated in France, &lsquo;<span class="t8">Ma foi, Monsieur, notre bonheur dépend de la façon que notre sang circule</span>.&rsquo; This have I learnt from a pretty hard course of experience, and would, from sincere benevolence, impress upon all who honour this book with a perusal, that until a steady conviction is obtained, that the present life is an imperfect state, and only a passage to a better, if we comply with the divine scheme of progressive improvement; and also that it is a part of the mysterious plan of Providence, that intellectual beings must &lsquo;be made perfect through suffering;&rsquo; there will be a continual recurrence of disappointment and uneasiness. But if we walk with hope in &lsquo;the mid-day sun&rsquo; of revelation, our temper and disposition will be such, that the comforts and enjoyments in our way will be relished, while we patiently support the inconveniences and pains. After much speculation and various reasonings, I acknowledge myself convinced of the truth of Voltaire&rsquo;s conclusion, &lsquo;<span class="t8">Après tout c èst un monde passable</span>.&rsquo; But we must not think too deeply;</p>
