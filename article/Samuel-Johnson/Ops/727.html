<p class="p10"><span class="t4">MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS ON THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH:</span></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">WITH REMARKS ON SIR T. HANMER&rsquo;S EDITION OF SHAKESPEARE.</span></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">NOTE I.</span></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">ACT I. SCENE I.</span></p>
<p class="p21"><span class="t8">Enter three Witches.</span></p>
<p class="p24">In order to make a true estimate of the abilities and merit of a writer, it is always necessary to examine the genius of his age, and the opinions of his contemporaries. A poet, who should now make the whole action of his tragedy depend upon enchantment, and produce the chief events by the assistance of supernatural agents, would be censured as transgressing the bounds of probability; he would be banished from the theatre to the nursery, and condemned to write fairy tales instead of tragedies; but a survey of the notions, that prevailed at the time when this play was written, will prove, that Shakespeare was in no danger of such censures, since he only turned the system that was then universally admitted to his advantage, and was far from over-burdening the credulity of his audience.</p>
<p class="p24">The reality of witchcraft or enchantment, which, though not strictly the same, are confounded in this play, has in all ages and countries been credited by the common people, and in most by the learned themselves. These phantoms have indeed appeared more frequently, in proportion as the darkness of ignorance has been more gross; but it cannot be shown, that the brightest gleams of knowledge have at any time been sufficient to drive them out of the world. The time, in which this kind of credulity was at its height, seems to have been that of the holy war, in which the Christians imputed all their defeats to enchantment or diabolical opposition, as they ascribe their success to the assistance of their military saints; and the learned Dr. Warburton appears to believe (Supplement to the Introduction to Don Quixote) that the first accounts of enchantments were brought into this part of the world by those who returned from their eastern expeditions. But there is always some distance between the birth and maturity of folly, as of wickedness: this opinion had long existed, though, perhaps, the application of it had in no foregoing age been so frequent, nor the reception so general. Olympiodorus, in Photius&rsquo;s Extracts, tells us of one Libanius, who practised this kind of military magick, and having promised [Greek: choris hopliton kata barbaron energein], <span class="t8">to perform great things against the barbarians without soldiers</span>, was, at the instances of the emperess Placidia, put to death, when he was about to have given proofs of his abilities. The emperess showed some kindness in her anger by cutting him off at a time so convenient for his reputation.</p>
<p class="p24">But a more remarkable proof of the antiquity of this notion may be found in St. Chrysostom&rsquo;s book de Sacerdotio, which exhibits a scene of enchantments, not exceeded by any romance of the middle age; he supposes a spectator, overlooking a field of battle, attended by one that points out all the various objects of horrour, the engines of destruction, and the arts of slaughter. [Greek: Deiknuto de eti para tois enantiois kai petomenous hippous dia tinos manganeias kai hoplitas di aeros pheromenous, kai pasaen goaeteias dunamin kai hidean.]<span class="t8">Let him then proceed to show him in the opposite armies horses flying by enchantment, armed men transported through the air, and every power and form of magick</span>. Whether St. Chrysostom believed that such performances were really to be seen in a day of battle, or only endeavoured to enliven his description, by adopting the notions of the vulgar, it is equally certain, that such notions were in his time received, and that, therefore, they were not imported from the Saracens in a later age; the wars with the Saracens, however, gave occasion to their propagation, not only as bigotry naturally discovers prodigies, but as the scene of action was removed to a greater distance, and distance, either of time or place, is sufficient to reconcile weak minds to wonderful relations.</p>
<p class="p24">The reformation did not immediately arrive at its meridian, and though day was gradually increasing upon us, the goblins of witchcraft still continued to hover in the twilight. In the time of queen Elizabeth was the remarkable trial of the witches of Warbois, whose conviction is still commemorated in an annual sermon at Huntingdon. But in the reign of king James, in which this tragedy was written, many circumstances concurred to propagate and confirm this opinion. The king, who was much celebrated for his knowledge, had, before his arrival in England, not only examined in person a woman accused of witchcraft, but had given a very formal account of the practices and illusions of evil spirits, the compacts of witches, the ceremonies used by them, the manner of detecting them, and the justice of punishing them, in his dialogues of <span class="t8">Daemonologie</span>, written in the Scottish dialect, and published at Edinburgh. This book was, soon after his accession, reprinted at London; and, as the ready way to gain king James&rsquo;s favour was to flatter his speculations, the system of <span class="t8">Daemonologie</span> was immediately adopted by all who desired either to gain preferment or not to lose it. Thus the doctrine of witchcraft was very powerfully inculcated; and as the greatest part of mankind have no other reason for their opinions than that they are in fashion, it cannot be doubted but this persuasion made a rapid progress, since vanity and credulity co-operated in its favour, and it had a tendency to free cowardice from reproach. The infection soon reached the parliament, who, in the first year of king James, made a law, by which it was enacted, chap. xii. That, &ldquo;if any person shall use any invocation or conjuration of any evil or wicked spirit; 2. or shall consult, covenant with, entertain, employ, feed or reward any evil or cursed spirit to or for any intent or purpose; 3. or take up any dead man, woman or child out of the grave, &mdash; or the skin, bone or any part of the dead person, to be employed or used in any manner of witchcraft, sorcery, charm or enchantment; 4. or shall use, practise or exercise any sort of witchcraft, sorcery, charm or enchantment; 5. whereby any person shall be destroyed, killed, wasted, consumed, pined or lamed in any part of the body; 6. That every such person, being convicted, shall suffer death.&rdquo; This law was repealed in our time.</p>
<p class="p24">Thus, in the time of Shakespeare, was the doctrine of witchcraft at once established by law and by the fashion, and it became not only unpolite, but criminal, to doubt it; and as prodigies are always seen in proportion as they are expected, witches were every day discovered, and multiplied so fast in some places, that bishop Hall mentions a village in Lancashire, where their number was greater than that of the houses. The Jesuits and Sectaries took advantage of this universal errour, and endeavoured to promote the interest of their parties by pretended cures of persons afflicted by evil spirits; but they were detected and exposed by the clergy of the established church.</p>
<p class="p24">Upon this general infatuation Shakespeare might be easily allowed to found a play, especially since he has followed with great exactness such histories as were then thought true; nor can it be doubted that the scenes of enchantment, however they may now be ridiculed, were both by himself and his audience thought awful and affecting.</p>
<p class="p24">NOTE III. [Transcriber&rsquo;s note: sic]</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">ACT I. SCENE II.</span></p>
<p class="p26">&nbsp;&mdash; The merciless Macdonal, &mdash; from the western isles<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Of <span class="t8">Kernes</span> and <span class="t8">Gallowglasses</span> was supply&rsquo;d;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;And fortune on his damned <span class="t8">quarry</span> smiling,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Shew&rsquo;d like a rebel&rsquo;s whore. &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Kernes</span> are light-armed, and <span class="t8">Gallowglasses</span> heavy-armed soldiers. The word <span class="t8">quarry</span> has no sense that is properly applicable in this place, and, therefore, it is necessary to read,</p>
<p class="p24">And fortune on his damned <span class="t8">quarrel</span> smiling.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Quarrel</span> was formerly used for <span class="t8">cause</span>, or for <span class="t8">the occasion of a quarrel</span>, and is to be found in that sense in Hollingshed&rsquo;s account of the story of Macbeth, who, upon the creation of the prince of Cumberland, thought, says the historian, that he had <span class="t8">a just quarrel</span> to endeavour after the crown. The sense, therefore, is, <span class="t8">fortune smiling on his execrable cause, &amp;c</span>.</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">NOTE III.</span></p>
<p class="p26">&nbsp;If I say sooth, I must report, they were<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;As cannons overcharg&rsquo;d with double cracks.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;So they redoubled strokes upon the foe.</p>
<p class="p24">Mr. Theobald has endeavoured to improve the sense of this passage by altering the punctuation thus:</p>
<p class="p26">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &mdash; They were<br/>As cannons overcharg&rsquo;d; with double cracks<br/>So they redoubled strokes. &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">He declares, with some degree of exultation, that he has no idea of <span class="t8">a cannon charged with double cracks</span>; but, surely, the great author will not gain much by an alteration which makes him say of a hero, that he <span class="t8">redoubles strokes with double cracks</span>, an expression not more loudly to be applauded, or more easily pardoned, than that which is rejected in its favour. That a <span class="t8">cannon is charged with thunder</span> or <span class="t8">with double thunders</span> may be written, not only without nonsense, but with elegance: and nothing else is here meant by <span class="t8">cracks</span>, which in the time of this writer was a word of such emphasis and dignity, that in this play he terms the general dissolution of nature the <span class="t8">crack of doom</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">There are among Mr. Theobald&rsquo;s alterations others which I do not approve, though I do not always censure them; for some of his amendments are so excellent, that, even when he has failed, he ought to be treated with indulgence and respect.</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">NOTE IV.</span></p>
<p class="p21"><span class="t8">King</span>. But who comes here?</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Mal</span>. The worthy Thane of Rosse.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Len</span>. What haste looks through his eyes? So should he look, that <span class="t8">seems</span> to speak things strange. The meaning of this passage, as it now stands, is, <span class="t8">so should he look, that looks as if he told things strange</span>. But Rosse neither yet told strange things, nor could look as if he told them; Lenox only conjectured from his air that he had strange things to tell, and, therefore, undoubtedly said,</p>
<p class="p26">&nbsp;&mdash; What haste looks through his eyes?<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;So should he look, that <span class="t8">teems</span> to speak things strange.</p>
<p class="p24">He looks like one that <span class="t8">is big</span> with something of importance; a metaphor so natural, that it is every day used in common discourse.</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">NOTE V.</span></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">SCENE III.</span></p>
<p class="p21"><span class="t8">Thunder. Enter the three Witches</span>.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">1 Witch</span>. Where hast thou been, sister?</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">2 Witch</span>. Killing swine.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">3 Witch</span>. Sister, where thou?</p>
<p class="p26">&nbsp;<span class="t8">1 Witch</span>. A sailor&rsquo;s wife had chesnuts in her lap,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And mouncht, and mouncht, and mouncht. Give me, quoth I.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Aroint thee, witch! &mdash; the rump-fed ronyon cries.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her husband&rsquo;s to Aleppo gone, master o&rsquo; th&rsquo; Tyger:<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in a sieve I&rsquo;ll thither sail,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And like a rat without a tail,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&rsquo;ll do &mdash; I&rsquo;ll do &mdash; and I&rsquo;ll do.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">2 Witch</span>. I&rsquo;ll give thee a wind.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">1 Witch</span>. Thou art kind.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">3 Witch</span>. And I another.</p>
<p class="p26">&nbsp;<span class="t8">1 Witch</span>. I myself have all the other.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the (b) very points they blow;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the quarters that they know,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&rsquo; th&rsquo; ship-man&rsquo;s card. &mdash; <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will drain him dry as hay,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sleep shall neither night nor day,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hang upon his pent-house lid;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He shall live a man (c) forbid;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weary sev&rsquo;n nights, nine times nine,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall he dwindle, peak and pine;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tho&rsquo; his bark cannot be lost,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet it shall be tempest-tost.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look, what I have.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">2 Witch</span>. Shew me, Shew me.</p>
<p class="p24">(a) Aroint thee, witch! In one of the folio editions the reading is <span class="t8">anoint thee</span>, in a sense very consistent with the common accounts of witches, who are related to perform many supernatural acts by the means of unguents, and particularly to fly through the air to the place where they meet at their hellish festivals. In this sense <span class="t8">anoint thee, witch</span>, will mean, <span class="t8">away, witch, to your infernal assembly</span>. This reading I was inclined to favour, because I had met with the word <span class="t8">aroint</span> in no other author; till looking into Hearne&rsquo;s Collections, I found it in a very old drawing, that he has published, in which St. Patrick is represented visiting hell, and putting the devils into great confusion by his presence, of whom one that is driving the damned before him with a prong, has a label issuing out from his mouth with these words, &ldquo;OUT OUT ARONGT,&rdquo; of which the last is evidently the same with <span class="t8">aroint</span>, and used in the same sense as in this passage.</p>
<p class="p24">(b) And the <span class="t8">very</span> points they blow. As the word <span class="t8">very</span> is here of no other use than to fill up the verse, it is likely that Shakespeare wrote <span class="t8">various</span>, which might be easily mistaken for <span class="t8">very</span>, being either negligently read, hastily pronounced, or imperfectly heard.</p>
<p class="p24">(c) He shall live a man <span class="t8">forbid</span>. Mr. Theobald has very justly explained <span class="t8">forbid</span> by <span class="t8">accursed</span>, but without giving any reason of his interpretation. To <span class="t8">bid</span> is originally <span class="t8">to pray</span>, as in this Saxon fragment:</p>
<p class="p24">[Anglo-Saxon: He is wis thaet bit g bote,] &amp;c.</p>
<p class="p24">He is wise that <span class="t8">prays</span> and makes amends.</p>
<p class="p24">As to <span class="t8">forbid</span>, therefore, implies to <span class="t8">prohibit</span>, in opposition to the word <span class="t8">bid</span>, in its present sense, it signifies by the same kind of opposition to <span class="t8">curse</span>, when it is derived from the same word in its primitive meaning.</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">NOTE VI.</span></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">SCENE V</span></p>
<p class="p21">The incongruity of all the passages, in which the Thane of Cawdor is mentioned, is very remarkable; in the second scene the Thanes of Rosse and Angus bring the king an account of the battle, and inform him that Norway,</p>
<p class="p26">&nbsp;Assisted by that most disloyal traitor<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Thane of Cawdor, &lsquo;gan a dismal conflict.</p>
<p class="p24">It appears that Cawdor was taken prisoner, for the king says, in the same scene,</p>
<p class="p26">&nbsp;&mdash; Go, pronounce his death;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;And with his former title greet Macbeth.</p>
<p class="p24">Yet though Cawdor was thus taken by Macbeth, in arms against his king, when Macbeth is saluted, in the fourth scene, <span class="t8">Thane of Cawdor</span>, by the Weird Sisters, he asks,</p>
<p class="p26">&nbsp;But how, of Cawdor? the Thane of Cawdor lives.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;A prosp&rsquo;rous gentleman; &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">And in the next line considers the promises, that he should be Cawdor and King, as equally unlikely to be accomplished. How can Macbeth be ignorant of the state of the Thane of Cawdor, whom he has just defeated and taken prisoner, or call him a <span class="t8">prosperous gentleman</span> who has forfeited his title and life by open rebellion? Or why should he wonder that the title of the rebel whom he has overthrown should be conferred upon him? He cannot be supposed to dissemble his knowledge of the condition of Cawdor, because he inquires with all the ardour of curiosity, and the vehemence of sudden astonishment; and because nobody is present but Banquo, who had an equal part in the battle, and was equally acquainted with Cawdor&rsquo;s treason. However, in the next scene, his ignorance still continues; and when Rosse and Angus present him from the king with his new title, he cries out,</p>
<p class="p26">&nbsp;&mdash; The Thane of Cawdor lives;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do you dress me in his borrow&rsquo;d robes?</p>
<p class="p24">Rosse and Angus, who were the messengers that, in the second scene, informed the king of the assistance given by Cawdor to the invader, having lost, as well as Macbeth, all memory of what they had so lately seen and related, make this answer,</p>
<p class="p26">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &mdash; Whether he was<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Combin&rsquo;d with Norway, or did line the rebel<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;With hidden help and &lsquo;vantage, or with both<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;He labour&rsquo;d in his country&rsquo;s wreck, I know not.</p>
<p class="p24">Neither Rosse knew what he had just reported, nor Macbeth what he had just done. This seems not to be one of the faults that are to be imputed to the transcribers, since, though the inconsistency of Rosse and Angus might be removed, by supposing that their names are erroneously inserted, and that only Rosse brought the account of the battle, and only Angus was sent to compliment Macbeth, yet the forgetfulness of Macbeth cannot be palliated, since what he says could not have been spoken by any other.</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">NOTE VII.</span></p>
<p class="p26">&nbsp;My thought, whose murther yet is but fantastical,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Shakes so my single state of man, &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">The <span class="t8">single state of man</span> seems to be used by Shakespeare for an <span class="t8">individual</span>, in opposition to a <span class="t8">commonwealth</span>, or <span class="t8">conjunct body</span> of men.</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">NOTE VIII.</span></p>
<p class="p26">&nbsp;<span class="t8">Macbeth.</span> &mdash; Come what come may,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="t8">Time and the hour</span> runs through the roughest day.</p>
<p class="p24">I suppose every reader is disgusted at the tautology in this passage, <span class="t8">time and the hour</span>, and will, therefore, willingly believe that Shakespeare wrote it thus,</p>
<p class="p26">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &mdash; Come what come may,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Time! on! &mdash; the hour runs thro&rsquo; the roughest day.</p>
<p class="p24">Macbeth is deliberating upon the events which are to befall him; but finding no satisfaction from his own thoughts, he grows impatient of reflection, and resolves to wait the close without harassing himself with conjectures:</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&mdash; Come what come may.</p>
<p class="p24">But, to shorten the pain of suspense, he calls upon time, in the usual style of ardent desire, to quicken his motion,</p>
<p class="p24">Time! on! &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">He then comforts himself with the reflection that all his perplexity must have an end,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&mdash; The hour runs thro&rsquo; the roughest day.</p>
<p class="p24">This conjecture is supported by the passage in the letter to his lady, in which he says, <span class="t8">They referr&rsquo;d me to the</span> coming on of time <span class="t8">with, Hail, King that shall be.</span></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">NOTE IX.</span></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">SCENE VI.</span></p>
<p class="p26">&nbsp;<span class="t8">Malcolm.</span> &mdash; Nothing in his life<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Became him like the leaving it. He dy&rsquo;d,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As one that had been studied in his death,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To throw away the dearest thing he <span class="t8">ow&rsquo;d</span>,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As &lsquo;twere a careless trifle.</p>
<p class="p24">As the word <span class="t8">ow&rsquo;d</span> affords here no sense, but such as is forced and unnatural, it cannot be doubted that it was originally written, The dearest thing he <span class="t8">own&rsquo;d</span>; a reading which needs neither defence nor explication.</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">NOTE X.</span></p>
<p class="p21"><span class="t8">King.</span> &mdash; There&rsquo;s no art, To find the mind&rsquo;s construction in the face:</p>
<p class="p24">The <span class="t8">construction of the mind</span> is, I believe, a phrase peculiar to Shakespeare; it implies the <span class="t8">frame</span> or <span class="t8">disposition</span> of the mind, by which it is determined to good or ill.</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">NOTE XI.</span></p>
<p class="p26">&nbsp;<span class="t8">Macbeth.</span> The service and the loyalty I owe,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In doing it, pays itself. Your highness&rsquo; part<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is to receive our duties; and our duties<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are to your throne and state, children and servants;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which do but what they should, by doing <span class="t8">every thing<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Safe tow&rsquo;rd your love and honour</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">Of the last line of this speech, which is certainly, as it is now read, unintelligible, an emendation has been attempted, which Dr. Warburton and Mr. Theobald have admitted as the true reading:</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&mdash; our duties Are to your throne and state, children and servants, Which do but what they should, in doing every thing <span class="t8">Fiefs</span> to your love and honour.</p>
<p class="p24">My esteem for these criticks, inclines me to believe, that they cannot be much pleased with the expressions, <span class="t8">Fiefs to love</span>, or <span class="t8">Fiefs to honour</span>; and that they have proposed this alteration, rather because no other occurred to them, than because they approved it. I shall, therefore, propose a bolder change, perhaps, with no better success, but &ldquo;sua cuique placent.&rdquo; I read thus,</p>
<p class="p26">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &mdash; our duties<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Are to your throne and state, children and servants,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Which do but what they should, in doing <span class="t8">nothing,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Save</span> tow&rsquo;rd <span class="t8">your love and honour</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">We do but perform our duty, when we contract all our views to your service, when we act with <span class="t8">no other</span> principle than regard to <span class="t8">your love and honour</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">It is probable that this passage was first corrupted by writing <span class="t8">safe</span> for <span class="t8">save</span>, and the lines then stood thus:</p>
<p class="p26">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &mdash; doing nothing<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Safe tow&rsquo;rd your love and honour.</p>
<p class="p24">Which the next transcriber observing to be wrong, and yet not being able to discover the real fault, altered to the present reading.</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">NOTE XII.</span></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">SCENE VII.</span></p>
<p class="p26">&nbsp;&mdash; Thou&rsquo;dst have, great Glamis,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;That which cries, &ldquo;thus thou must do, if thou have <span class="t8">it</span>;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that,&rdquo; &amp;c.</p>
<p class="p24">As the object of Macbeth&rsquo;s desire is here introduced speaking of itself, it is necessary to read,</p>
<p class="p26">&nbsp;&mdash; thou&rsquo;dst have, great Glamis,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;That which cries, &ldquo;thus thou must do, if thou have <span class="t8">me</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">NOTE XIII.</span></p>
<p class="p26">&nbsp;&mdash; Hie thee hither,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;That I may pour my spirits in thine ear;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;And chastise with the valour of my tongue<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;All that impedes thee from the golden round,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Which fate and metaphysical aid doth <span class="t8">seem</span><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;To have thee crown&rsquo;d withal.</p>
<p class="p24">For <span class="t8">seem</span>, the sense evidently directs us to read <span class="t8">seek</span>.

<p class="p24">&nbsp;&mdash; Mortal thoughts, &mdash; This expression signifies not <span class="t8">the thoughts of mortals</span>, but <span class="t8">murderous, deadly</span>, or <span class="t8">destructive designs</span>. So in Act v.</p>
<p class="p24">Hold fast the <span class="t8">mortal</span> sword.</p>
<p class="p24">And in another place,</p>
<p class="p24">With twenty <span class="t8">mortal</span> murthers.</p>
<p class="p26">&nbsp;&mdash; Nor keep <span class="t8">peace</span> between<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Th&rsquo; effect and it! &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">The intent of Lady Macbeth evidently is to wish that no womanish tenderness, or conscientious remorse, may hinder her purpose from proceeding to effect; but neither this, nor indeed any other sense, is expressed by the present reading, and, therefore, it cannot be doubted that Shakespeare wrote differently, perhaps, thus:</p>
<p class="p26">&nbsp;That no compunctious visitings of nature<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Shake my fell purpose, nor <span class="t8">keep pace</span> between<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Th&rsquo; effect and it.</p>
<p class="p24">To <span class="t8">keep pace between</span>, may signify to <span class="t8">pass between</span>, to <span class="t8">intervene</span>. Pace is, on many occasions, a favourite of Shakespeare. This phrase, is indeed, not usual in this sense; but was it not its novelty that gave occasion to the present corruption?</p>

<p class="p26">&nbsp;<span class="t8">King</span>. This castle hath a pleasant seat; the air<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nimbly and sweetly recommends itself<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unto our gentle senses.</p>
<p class="p26">&nbsp;<span class="t8">Ban</span>. This guest of summer,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The temple-haunting martlet, does approve,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By his lov&rsquo;d mansionry, that heaven&rsquo;s breath<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smells wooingly here.

<p class="p24">In this short scene, I propose a slight alteration to be made, by substituting <span class="t8">site</span> for <span class="t8">seat</span>, as the ancient word for situation; and <span class="t8">sense</span> for <span class="t8">senses</span>, as more agreeable to the measure; for which reason likewise I have endeavoured to adjust this passage,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&mdash; heaven&rsquo;s breath Smells wooingly here. No jutty frieze,</p>
<p class="p24">by changing the punctuation and adding the syllable thus,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&mdash; heaven&rsquo;s breath Smells wooingly. Here is no jutty frieze.</p>
<p class="p24">Those who have perused books, printed at the time of the first editions of Shakespeare, know that greater alterations than these are necessary almost in every page, even where it is not to be doubted, that the copy was correct.</p>

<p class="p10"><span class="t4">SCENE. X.</span></p>
<p class="p21">The arguments by which Lady Macbeth persuades her husband to commit the murder, afford a proof of Shakespeare&rsquo;s knowledge of human nature. She urges the excellence and dignity of courage, a glittering idea which has dazzled mankind from age to age, and animated sometimes the housebreaker, and sometimes the conqueror; but this sophism Macbeth has for ever destroyed, by distinguishing true from false fortitude, in a line and a half; of which it may almost be said, that they ought to bestow immortality on the author, though all his other productions had been lost:</p>
<p class="p26">&nbsp;I dare do all that may become a man;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Who dares do more is none.</p>
<p class="p24">This topick, which has been always employed with too much success, is used in this scene, with peculiar propriety, to a soldier by a woman. Courage is the distinguishing virtue of a soldier, and the reproach of cowardice cannot be borne by any man from a woman, without great impatience.</p>
<p class="p24">She then urges the oaths by which he had bound himself to murder Duncan, another art of sophistry by which men have sometimes deluded their consciences, and persuaded themselves that what would be criminal in others is virtuous in them: this argument Shakespeare, whose plan obliged him to make Macbeth yield, has not confuted, though he might easily have shown that a former obligation could not be vacated by a latter.</p>

<p class="p10"><span class="t4">ACT II. SCENE II.</span></p>
<p class="p26">&nbsp;&mdash; Now o&rsquo;er one half the world<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)<span class="t8">Nature seems dead</span>, and wicked dreams abuse<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;The curtain&rsquo;d sleep; now witchcraft celebrates<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Pale Hecat&rsquo;s offerings: and wither&rsquo;d murther,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Alarum&rsquo;d by his sentinel, the wolf,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose howl&rsquo;s his watch, thus with his stealthy pace,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="t8">With (b)Tarquin&rsquo;s ravishing sides</span> tow&rsquo;rds his design<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Moves like a ghost. &mdash; Thou sound and firm-set earth,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Hear not my steps, which way they walk, for fear<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy very stones prate of my where-about;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="t8">And (c)take the present horror from the time,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Which now suits with it</span>. &mdash; </p>
<p class="p26">(a) &mdash; Now o&rsquo;er one half the world<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nature seems dead.</p>
<p class="p24">That is, <span class="t8">over our hemisphere all action and motion seem to have ceased</span>. This image, which is, perhaps, the most striking that poetry can produce, has been adopted by Dryden, in his Conquest of Mexico.</p>
<p class="p26">&nbsp;All things are hush&rsquo;d as Nature&rsquo;s self lay dead,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;The mountains seem to nod their drowsy head:<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;The little birds in dreams their songs repeat,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;And sleeping flowers beneath the night dews sweat.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Even lust and envy sleep!</p>
<p class="p24">These lines, though so well known, I have transcribed, that the contrast between them and this passage of Shakespeare may be more accurately observed.</p>
<p class="p24">Night is described by two great poets, but one describes a night of quiet, the other of perturbation. In the night of Dryden, all the disturbers of the world are laid asleep; in that of Shakespeare, nothing but sorcery, lust, and murder, is awake. He that reads Dryden, finds himself lulled with serenity, and disposed to solitude and contemplation. He that peruses Shakespeare, looks round alarmed, and starts to find himself alone. One is the night of a lover; the other, that of a murderer.</p>
<p class="p26">&nbsp;(b) &mdash; Wither&rsquo;d murder,<br/>&nbsp;&mdash; thus with his stealthy pace,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;With Tarquin&rsquo;s ravishing <span class="t8">sides</span> tow&rsquo;rds his design,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Moves like a ghost. &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">This was the reading of this passage in all the editions before that of Mr. Pope, who for <span class="t8">sides</span>, inserted in the text <span class="t8">strides</span>, which Mr. Theobald has tacitly copied from him, though a more proper alteration might, perhaps, have been made. A <span class="t8">ravishing stride</span> is an action of violence, impetuosity, and tumult, like that of a savage rushing on his prey; whereas the poet is here attempting to exhibit an image of secrecy and caution, of anxious circumspection and guilty timidity, the <span class="t8">stealthy pace</span> of a <span class="t8">ravisher</span> creeping into the chamber of a virgin, and of an assassin approaching the bed of him whom he proposes to murder, without awaking him; these he describes as <span class="t8">moving like ghosts</span>, whose progression is so different from <span class="t8">strides</span>, that it has been in all ages represented to be, as Milton expresses it,</p>
<p class="p24">Smooth sliding without step.</p>
<p class="p24">This hemistich will afford the true reading of this place, which is, I think, to be corrected thus:</p>
<p class="p26">&nbsp;&mdash; and wither&rsquo;d murder,<br/>&nbsp;&mdash; thus with his stealthy pace,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;With Tarquin ravishing, <span class="t8">slides</span> tow&rsquo;rds his design,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Moves like a ghost.</p>
<p class="p24">Tarquin is, in this place, the general name of a ravisher, and the sense is: Now is the time in which every one is asleep, but those who are employed in wickedness, the witch who is sacrificing to Hecate, and the ravisher, and the murderer, who, like me, are stealing upon their prey.</p>
<p class="p24">When the reading is thus adjusted, he wishes with great propriety, in the following lines, that the <span class="t8">earth</span> may not <span class="t8">hear his steps</span>.</p>
<p class="p26">&nbsp;(c) And take the present horror from the time.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Which now suits with it. &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">I believe every one that has attentively read this dreadful soliloquy is disappointed at the conclusion, which, if not wholly unintelligible, is at least obscure, nor can be explained into any sense worthy of the author. I shall, therefore, propose a slight alteration,</p>
<p class="p26">&nbsp; &mdash; Thou sound and firm-set earth,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Hear not my steps, which way they walk, for fear<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy very stones prate of my where-about,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;And <span class="t8">talk</span> &mdash; the present horror of the time! &mdash; <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;That now suits with it. &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">Macbeth has, in the foregoing lines, disturbed his imagination by enumerating all the terrours of the night; at length he is wrought up to a degree of frenzy, that makes him afraid of some supernatural discovery of his design, and calls out to the stones not to betray him, not to declare where he walks, nor <span class="t8">to talk</span>. &mdash; As he is going to say of what, he discovers the absurdity of his suspicion, and pauses, but is again overwhelmed by his guilt, and concludes that such are the horrours of the present night, that the stones may be expected to cry out against him:</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">That</span> now suits with it.</p>
<p class="p24">He observes in a subsequent passage, that on such occasions <span class="t8">stones have been known to move</span>. It is now a very just and strong picture of a man about to commit a deliberate murder, under the strongest convictions of the wickedness of his design.</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">NOTE XXI.</span></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">SCENE IV.</span></p>
<p class="p26">&nbsp;<span class="t8">Len</span>. The night has been unruly; where we lay<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our chimneys were blown down: and, as they say,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lamentings heard i&rsquo;th&rsquo;air, strange screams of death,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And prophesying with accents terrible<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of dire combustion, and confused events,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="t8">New-hatch&rsquo;d to the woeful time</span>.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The obscure bird clamour&rsquo;d the live-long night:<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some say, the earth was fev&rsquo;rous, and did shake.</p>
<p class="p24">These lines, I think, should be rather regulated thus:</p>
<p class="p26">&nbsp;&mdash; prophesying with accents terrible,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Of dire combustion and confused events.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;New-hatch&rsquo;d to th&rsquo;woeful time, the obscure bird<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Clamour&rsquo;d the live-long night. Some say, the earth<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Was fev&rsquo;rous and did shake.</p>
<p class="p24">A <span class="t8">prophecy</span> of an <span class="t8">event new-hatch&rsquo;d</span>, seems to be <span class="t8">a prophecy</span> of an <span class="t8">event past</span>. The term <span class="t8">new-hatch&rsquo;d</span> is properly applicable to a <span class="t8">bird</span>, and that birds of ill omen should be <span class="t8">new-hatch&rsquo;d to the woeful time</span> is very consistent with the rest of the prodigies here mentioned, and with the universal disorder into which nature is described as thrown, by the perpetration of this horrid murder.</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">NOTE XXII.</span></p>

<p class="p24">The second line might have been so easily completed, that it cannot be supposed to have been left imperfect by the author, who probably wrote,</p>
<p class="p26">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &mdash; Malcolm! Banquo! rise!<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;As from your graves rise up. &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">Many other emendations, of the same kind, might be made, without any greater deviation from the printed copies, than is found in each of them from the rest.</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">NOTE XXIII.</span></p>
<p class="p21"><span class="t8">Macbeth</span>. &mdash; Here, lay Duncan, His silver skin laced with his golden blood; And his gash&rsquo;d stabs look&rsquo;d like a breach in nature, For ruin&rsquo;s wasteful entrance: there, the murtherers Steep&rsquo;d in the colours of their trade, their daggers <span class="t8">Unmannerly breech&rsquo;d with gore</span>. &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">An <span class="t8">unmannerly dagger</span>, and a <span class="t8">dagger breech&rsquo;d</span>, or as in some editions <span class="t8">breach&rsquo;d with gore</span>, are expressions not easily to be understood, nor can it be imagined that Shakespeare would reproach the murderer of his king only with <span class="t8">want of manners</span>. There are, undoubtedly, two faults in this passage, which I have endeavoured to take away by reading,</p>
<p class="p26">&nbsp;&mdash; Daggers<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="t8">Unmanly drench&rsquo;d</span> with gore. &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">I saw</span> drench&rsquo;d <span class="t8">with the king&rsquo;s Mood the fatal daggers, not only instruments of murder but evidences of</span> cowardice.</p>
<p class="p24">Each of these words might easily be confounded with that which I have substituted for it by a hand not exact, a casual blot, or a negligent inspection.</p>
<p class="p24">Mr. Pope has endeavoured to improve one of these lines, by substituting <span class="t8">goary blood</span> for <span class="t8">golden blood</span>, but it may easily be admitted, that he who could on such an occasion talk of <span class="t8">lacing the silver skin</span>, would <span class="t8">lace it</span> with <span class="t8">golden blood</span>. No amendment can be made to this line, of which every word is equally faulty, but by a general blot.</p>
<p class="p24">It is not improbable, that Shakespeare put these forced and unnatural metaphors into the mouth of Macbeth, as a mark of artifice and dissimulation, to show the difference between the studied language of hypocrisy, and the natural outcries of sudden passion. This whole speech, considered in this light, is a remarkable instance of judgment, as if consists entirely of antitheses and metaphors.</p>

<p class="p26">(a) &mdash; As, it is said,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony&rsquo;s was by Cæsar.</p>
<p class="p24">Though I would not often assume the critick&rsquo;s privilege, of being confident where certainty cannot be obtained, nor indulge myself too far, in departing from the established reading; yet I cannot but propose the rejection of this passage, which, I believe, was an insertion of some player, that, having so much learning as to discover to what Shakespeare alluded, was not willing that his audience should be less knowing than himself, and has, therefore, weakened the author&rsquo;s sense by the intrusion of a remote and useless image into a speech bursting from a man wholly possessed with his own present condition, and, therefore, not at leisure to explain his own allusions to himself. If these words are taken away, by which not only the thought but the numbers are injured, the lines of Shakespeare close together without any traces of a breach.</p>
<p class="p24">My genius is rebuk&rsquo;d. He chid the sisters.</p>
<p class="p24">(b) &mdash; The common enemy of man.</p>
<p class="p24">It is always an entertainment to an inquisitive reader, to trace a sentiment to its original source, and, therefore, though the term enemy of man, applied to the devil, is in itself natural and obvious, yet some may be pleased with being informed, that Shakespeare probably borrowed it from the first lines of the Destruction of Troy, a book which he is known to have read.</p>
<p class="p24">That this remark may not appear too trivial, I shall take occasion from it to point out a beautiful passage of Milton, evidently copied from a book of no greater authority: in describing the gates of hell, Book ii. v.879, he says,</p>
<p class="p26">&nbsp;&mdash; On a sudden open fly,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;With impetuous recoil and jarring sound,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Th&rsquo; infernal doors, and on their hinges grate<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Harsh thunder.</p>
<p class="p24">In the history of Don Bellianis, when one of the knights approaches, as I remember, the castle of Brandezar, the gates are said to open, <span class="t8">grating harsh thunder upon their brazen hinges</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">(c) &mdash; Come fate into the list, And champion me to th&rsquo; utterance. &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">This passage will be best explained by translating it into the language from whence the only word of difficulty in it is borrowed. <span class="t8">Que la destinée se rende en lice, et qu&rsquo;elle me donne un défi</span> à l&rsquo;outrance. A challenge or a combat <span class="t8">a l&rsquo;outrance, to extremity</span>, was a fixed term in the law of arms, used when the combatants engaged with an <span class="t8">odium internecinum, an intention to destroy each other</span>, in opposition to trials of skill at festivals, or on other occasions, where the contest was only for reputation or a prize. The sense, therefore, is, Let fate, that has fore-doomed the exaltation of the sons of Banquo, enter the lists against me, with the utmost animosity, in defence of its own decrees, which I will endeavour to invalidate, whatever be the danger.</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">NOTE XXV.</span></p>
<p class="p26">&nbsp;<span class="t8">Macbeth</span>.

<p class="p24">Though this is not the most sparkling passage in the play, and though the name of a dog is of no great importance, yet it may not be improper to remark, that there is no such species of dogs as <span class="t8">shoughs</span> mentioned by Caius De Canibus Britannicis, or any other writer that has fallen into my hands, nor is the word to be found in any dictionary which I have examined. I, therefore, imagined that it is falsely printed for <span class="t8">slouths</span>, a kind of slow hound bred in the southern parts of England, but was informed by a lady, that it is more probably used, either by mistake, or according to the orthography of that time, for <span class="t8">shocks</span>.</p>

<p class="p24">What is meant by <span class="t8">the spy of the time</span>, it will be found difficult to explain; and, therefore, sense will be cheaply gained by a slight alteration. &mdash; Macbeth is assuring the assassins that they shall not want directions to find Banquo, and, therefore, says,</p>
<p class="p26">I will &mdash; <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="t8">Acquaint you with</span> a perfect spy <span class="t8">o&rsquo;th&rsquo;time</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">Accordingly a third murderer joins them afterwards at the place of action.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Perfect</span> is <span class="t8">well instructed</span>, or <span class="t8">well informed</span>, as in this play,</p>
<p class="p24">Though in your state of honour I am <span class="t8">perfect</span>.</p>

<p class="p21"><span class="t8">2 Murderer</span>. He needs not to mistrust, since he delivers Our offices and what we have to do, To the direction just.</p>
<p class="p24">Mr. Theobald has endeavoured unsuccessfully to amend this passage, in which nothing is faulty but the punctuation. The meaning of this abrupt dialogue is this: The <span class="t8">perfect spy</span>, mentioned by Macbeth in the foregoing scene, has, before they enter upon the stage, given them the directions which were promised at the time of their agreement; and, therefore, one of the murderers observes, that, since <span class="t8">he has given them such exact information, he needs not doubt of their performance</span>. Then, by way of exhortation to his associates, he cries out,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&mdash; To the direction just.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Now nothing remains but that we conform exactly to Macbeth&rsquo;s directions</span>.</p>

<p class="p21"><span class="t8">Macbeth</span>. You know your own degrees, sit down: At first and last, the hearty welcome.</p>
<p class="p24">As this passage stands, not only the numbers are very imperfect, but the sense, if any can be found, weak and contemptible. The numbers will be improved by reading,</p>
<p class="p26">&nbsp;&mdash; sit down at first,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;And last a hearty welcome.</p>
<p class="p24">But for <span class="t8">last</span> should then be written <span class="t8">next</span>. I believe the true reading is,</p>
<p class="p26">&nbsp;You know your own degrees, sit down &mdash; <span class="t8">To</span> first<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;And last the hearty welcome.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">All of whatever degree, from the highest to the lowest, may be assured that their visit is well received</span>.</p>

<p class="p24">The sense apparently requires that this passage should be read thus:</p>
<p class="p24">&rsquo;Tis better thee without, than <span class="t8">him</span> within.</p>
<p class="p24">That is, <span class="t8">I am more pleased that the blood of Banquo should be on thy face, than in his body</span>.</p>

Why do you make such faces? When all&rsquo;s done, You look but on a stool.</p>
<p class="p24">As <span class="t8">starts</span> can neither with propriety nor sense be called <span class="t8">impostures to true fear</span>, something else was undoubtedly intended by the author, who, perhaps, wrote,</p>
<p class="p26">&nbsp;&mdash; These flaws and starts,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="t8">Impostures true to fear</span>, would well become<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;A woman&rsquo;s story. &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">These symptoms of terrour and amazement might better become <span class="t8">impostors true</span> only <span class="t8">to fear, might become a coward at the recital of such falsehoods, as no man could credit, whose understanding was not weakened by his terrours; tales, told by a woman over a fire on the authority of her grandam</span>.</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">NOTE XXXI.</span></p>
<p class="p21"><span class="t8">Macbeth</span>. &mdash; Love and health to all!

<p class="p24">Though this passage is, as it now stands, capable of more meanings than one, none of them are very satisfactory; and, therefore, I am inclined to read it thus:</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&mdash; to all, and him, we thirst, <span class="t8">And hail to all</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">Macbeth, being about to salute his company with a bumper, declares that he includes Banquo, though absent, in this act of kindness, and wishes <span class="t8">health</span> to all. <span class="t8">Hail</span> or <span class="t8">heil</span> for <span class="t8">health</span> was in such continual use among the good-fellows of ancient times, that a drinker was called a <span class="t8">was-heiler</span>, or a <span class="t8">wisher of health</span>, and the liquor was termed <span class="t8">was-heil</span>, because <span class="t8">health</span> was so often <span class="t8">wished</span> over it. Thus in the lines of Hanvil the monk,</p>
<p class="p26">&nbsp;Jamque vagante scypho, discincto gutture <span class="t8">was-heil</span><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Ingeminant <span class="t8">was-heil</span>: labor est plus perdere vini<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Quam sitis. &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">These words were afterwards corrupted into <span class="t8">wassail</span> and <span class="t8">wassailer</span>.</p>

<p class="p24">This passage, as it now stands, is unintelligible, but may be restored to sense by a very slight alteration:</p>
<p class="p26">&nbsp;&mdash; You make me strange<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Ev&rsquo;n to the disposition that I <span class="t8">know</span>.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Though I had before seen many instances of your courage, yet it now appears in a degree altogether</span> new. <span class="t8">So that my long</span> acquaintance <span class="t8">with your</span> disposition <span class="t8">does not hinder me from that astonishment which</span> novelty <span class="t8">produces</span>.</p>

<p class="p24">In this passage the first line loses much of its force by the present punctuation. Macbeth having considered the prodigy which has just appeared, infers justly from it, that the death of Duncan cannot pass unpunished;</p>
<p class="p24">It will have blood: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">then, after a short pause, declares it as the general observation of mankind, that murderers cannot escape:</p>

<p class="p24">Murderers, when they have practised all human means of security, are detected by supernatural directions:</p>

<p class="p24">By the word <span class="t8">relation</span> is understood the <span class="t8">connexion</span> of effects with causes; to <span class="t8">understand relations</span> as <span class="t8">an augur</span>, is to know how those things <span class="t8">relate</span> to each other, which have no visible combination or dependence.</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">NOTE XXXIV.</span></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">SCENE VII.</span></p>
<p class="p21"><span class="t8">Enter Lenox and another Lord</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">As this tragedy, like the rest of Shakespeare&rsquo;s, is, perhaps, overstocked with personages, it is not easy to assign a reason, why a nameless character should be introduced here, since nothing is said that might not, with equal propriety, have been put into the mouth of any other disaffected man. I believe, therefore, that in the original copy, it was written, with a very common form of contraction, <span class="t8">Lenox and An</span>. for which the transcriber, instead of Lenox and Angus, set down, Lenox and <span class="t8">another Lord</span>. The author had, indeed, been more indebted to the transcriber&rsquo;s fidelity and diligence, had he committed no errours of greater importance.</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">NOTE XXXV.</span></p>
<p class="p21">As this is the chief scene of enchantment in the play, it is proper, in this place, to observe, with how much judgment Shakespeare has selected all the circumstances of his infernal ceremonies, and how exactly he has conformed to common opinions and traditions:</p>
<p class="p24">Thrice the brinded cat hath mew&rsquo;d.</p>
<p class="p24">The usual form in which familiar spirits are reported to converse with witches, is that of a cat. A witch, who was tried about half a century before the time of Shakespeare, had a cat named Rutterkin, as the spirit of one of those witches was Grimalkin; and when any mischief was to be done, she used to bid Rutterkin <span class="t8">go and fly</span>; but once, when she would have sent Rutterkin to torment a daughter of the countess of Rutland, instead of <span class="t8">going</span> or <span class="t8">flying</span>, he only cried <span class="t8">mew</span>, from whence she discovered that the lady was out of his power, the power of witches being not universal, but limited, as Shakespeare has taken care to inculcate:</p>
<p class="p26">&nbsp;Though his bark cannot be lost,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet it shall be tempest-tost.</p>
<p class="p24">The common afflictions which the malice of witches produced, were melancholy, fits, and loss of flesh, which are threatened by one of Shakespeare&rsquo;s witches:</p>
<p class="p26">Weary sev&rsquo;n nights, nine times nine,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall he dwindle, peak, and pine.</p>
<p class="p24">It was, likewise, their practice to destroy the cattle of their neighbours, and the farmers have, to this day, many ceremonies to secure their cows and other cattle from witchcraft; but they seem to have been most suspected of malice against swine. Shakespeare has, accordingly, made one of his witches declare that she has been <span class="t8">killing swine</span>; and Dr. Harsenet observes, that, about that time, &ldquo;a sow could not be ill of the measles, nor a girl of the sullens, but some old woman was charged with witchcraft.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p26">&nbsp;Toad, that under the cold stone,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Days and nights hast thirty-one,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Swelter&rsquo;d venom sleeping got,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Boil thou first i&rsquo; the charmed pot.</p>
<p class="p24">Toads have, likewise, long lain under the reproach of being by some means accessary to witchcraft, for which reason Shakespeare, in the first scene of this play, calls one of the spirits Padocke, or Toad, and now takes care to put a toad first into the pot. When Vaninus was seized at Tholouse, there was found at his lodgings, &ldquo;ingens bufo vitro inclusus,&rdquo; <span class="t8">a great toad shut in a vial</span>, upon which those that prosecuted him &ldquo;veneficium exprobrabant,&rdquo; <span class="t8">charged him</span>, I suppose, <span class="t8">with witchcraft</span>.</p>
<p class="p26">&nbsp;Fillet of a fenny snake,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;In the cauldron boil and bake:<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Eye of newt, and toe of frog; &mdash; For a charm, &amp;c.</p>
<p class="p26">The propriety of these ingredients may be known by consulting the books<br/>De Viribus Animalium and De Mirabilibus Mundi, ascribed to Albertus<br/>Magnus, in which the reader, who has time and credulity, may discover<br/>very wonderful secrets.</p>
<p class="p26">&nbsp;Finger of birth-strangled babe,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Ditch-deliver&rsquo;d by a drab &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">It has been already mentioned, in the law against witches, that they are supposed to take up dead bodies to use in enchantments, which was confessed by the woman whom king James examined, and who had of a dead body, that was divided in one of their assemblies, two fingers for her share. It is observable, that Shakespeare, on this great occasion, which involves the fate of a king, multiplies all the circumstances of horrour. The babe, whose finger is used, must be strangled in its birth; the grease must not only be human, but must have dropped from a gibbet, the gibbet of a murderer; and even the sow, whose blood is used, must have offended nature by devouring her own farrow. These are touches of judgment and genius.</p>
<p class="p24">And now about the cauldron sing &mdash; </p>
<p class="p26">&nbsp;Black spirits and white,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Red spirits and grey,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Mingle, mingle, mingle,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You that mingle may.</p>
<p class="p24">And, in a former part:</p>
<p class="p26">&nbsp;&mdash; weird sisters hand in hand, &mdash; <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus do go about, about;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thrice to thine, and thrice to mine,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;And thrice again, to make up nine;</p>
<p class="p24">These two passages I have brought together, because they both seem subject to the objection of too much levity for the solemnity of enchantment, and may both be shown, by one quotation from Camden&rsquo;s account of Ireland, to be founded upon a practice really observed by the uncivilized natives of that country. &ldquo;When any one gets a fall,&rdquo; says the informer of Camden, &ldquo;he starts up, and, <span class="t8">turning three times to the right</span>, digs a hole in the earth; for they imagine that there is a spirit in the ground, and if he falls sick in two or three days, they send one of their women that is skilled in that way to the place, where she says, I call thee from the east, west, north, and south, from the groves, the woods, the rivers, and the fens, from the <span class="t8">fairies, red, black, white</span>.&rdquo; There was, likewise, a book written before the time of Shakespeare, describing, amongst other properties, the <span class="t8">colours</span> of spirits.</p>
<p class="p24">Many other circumstances might be particularized, in which Shakespeare has shown his judgment and his knowledge.</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">NOTE XXXVI.</span></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">SCENE II.</span></p>
<p class="p26">&nbsp;<span class="t8">Macbeth</span>. Thou art too like the spirit of Banquo; down!<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy crown does (a)sear mine eye-balls: &mdash; and thy (b)<span class="t8">hair</span>,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou other gold-bound brow, is like the first: &mdash; <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A third is like the former.</p>
<p class="p24">(a) The expression of Macbeth, that the <span class="t8">crown sears</span> his eye-balls, is taken from the method formerly practised of destroying the sight of captives or competitors, by holding a burning bason before the eye, which dried up its humidity. Whence the Italian, <span class="t8">abacinare, to blind</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">(b) As Macbeth expected to see a train of kings, and was only inquiring from what race they would proceed, he could not be surprised that the <span class="t8">hair</span> of the second was <span class="t8">bound with gold</span>, like that of the first; he was offended only that the second resembled the first, as the first resembled Banquo, and, therefore, said:</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&mdash; and thy <span class="t8">air</span>, Thou other gold-bound brow, is like the first.</p>

<p class="p24">Both the sense and measure of the third line, which, as it rhymes, ought, according to the practice of this author, to be regular, are, at present, injured by two superfluous syllables, which may easily be removed by reading,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&mdash; souls That trace his line: &mdash; No boasting like a fool.</p>

<p class="p26">(a) &mdash; When we hold rumour<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From what we fear, yet know not what we fear.</p>
<p class="p24">The present reading seems to afford no sense; and, therefore, some critical experiments may be properly tried upon it, though, the verses being without any connexion, there is room for suspicion, that some intermediate lines are lost, and that the passage is, therefore, irretrievable. If it be supposed that the fault arises only from the corruption of some words, and that the traces of the true reading are still to be found, the passage may be changed thus:</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&mdash; when we <span class="t8">bode ruin</span> From what we fear, yet know not what we fear.</p>
<p class="p24">Or, in a sense very applicable to the occasion of the conference:</p>
<p class="p26">&nbsp;&mdash; when the <span class="t8">bold, running</span><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;From what they fear, yet know not what they fear.</p>
<p class="p26">(b) But float upon a wild and violent sea<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each way, and move.</p>
<p class="p24">That he who <span class="t8">floats</span> upon a <span class="t8">rough sea</span> must move, is evident, too evident for Shakespeare so emphatically to assert. The line, therefore, is to be written thus:</p>
<p class="p24">Each way, and move &mdash; I&rsquo;ll take my leave of you.</p>

<p class="p24">He who can discover what is meant by him that earnestly exhorts him to <span class="t8">bestride</span> his <span class="t8">downfal birth-doom</span>, is at liberty to adhere to the present text; but those who are willing to confess that such counsel would to them be unintelligible, must endeavour to discover some reading less obscure. It is probable that Shakespeare wrote:</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&mdash; like good men, Bestride our <span class="t8">downfall&rsquo;n birthdom</span> &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">The allusion is to a man from whom something valuable is about to be taken by violence, and who, that he may defend it without encumbrance, lays it on the ground, and stands over it with his weapon in his hand. Our birthdom, or birthright, says he, lies on the ground, let us, like men who are to fight for what is dearest to them, not abandon it, but stand over it and defend it. This is a strong picture of obstinate resolution.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Birthdom</span> for <span class="t8">birthright</span> is formed by the same analogy with <span class="t8">masterdom</span> in this play, signifying the <span class="t8">privileges</span> or <span class="t8">rights of a master</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">Perhaps it might be <span class="t8">birth-dame</span> for <span class="t8">mother</span>; let us stand over our mother that lies bleeding on the ground.</p>

<p class="p24">The <span class="t8">chance of goodness</span>, as it is commonly read, conveys no sense. If there be not some more important errour in the passage, it should, at least, be pointed thus:</p>
<p class="p26">&nbsp;&mdash; And the chance, of goodness,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Be like our warranted quarrel!</p>
<p class="p24">That is, may the event be, of the goodness of heaven, [<span class="t8">pro justicia divina</span>,] answerable to the cause.</p>
<p class="p24">But I am inclined to believe that Shakespeare wrote,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&mdash; and the chance, O goodness, Be like our warranted quarrel!</p>
<p class="p24">This some of his transcribers wrote with a small <span class="t8">o</span>, which another imagined to mean <span class="t8">of</span>.

<p class="p24">The reproach of epicurism, on which Mr. Theobald has bestowed a note, is nothing more than a natural invective, uttered by an inhabitant of a barren country, against those who have more opportunities of luxury.</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">NOTE XLII.</span></p>
<p class="p21"><span class="t8">Macbeth</span>. I have liv&rsquo;d long enough: my <span class="t8">way</span> of life Is fall&rsquo;n into the sear, the yellow leaf.</p>
<p class="p24">As there is no relation between the <span class="t8">way of life</span>, and <span class="t8">fallen into the sear</span>, I am inclined to think, that the <span class="t8">W</span> is only an <span class="t8">M</span> inverted, and that it was originally written, my <span class="t8">May</span> of life.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">I am now passed from the spring to the autumn of my days, but I am without those comforts that should succeed the sprightliness of bloom, and support me in this melancholy season.</span></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">NOTE XLIII.</span></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">SCENE IV.</span></p>
<p class="p26">&nbsp;<span class="t8">Malcolm</span>. &rsquo;Tis his main hope:<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For where there is <span class="t8">advantage to be given</span>,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both more and less have given him the revolt;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And none serve with him but constrained things,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose hearts are absent too.</p>
<p class="p24">The impropriety of the expression <span class="t8">advantage to be given</span>, instead of <span class="t8">advantage given</span>, and the disagreeable repetition of the word <span class="t8">given</span> in the next line incline me to read,</p>
<p class="p26">&nbsp;&mdash; where there is <span class="t8">a&rsquo;vantage</span> to be <span class="t8">gone</span>,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Both more and less have given him the revolt.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Advantage</span> or <span class="t8">&lsquo;vantage</span>, in the time of Shakespeare, signified <span class="t8">opportunity</span>.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">More and less</span> is the same with <span class="t8">greater and less</span>. So in the interpolated Mandeville, a book of that age, there is a chapter of India the more and the less.</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">NOTE XLIV.</span></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">SCENE V.</span></p>
<p class="p26">&nbsp;<span class="t8">Macbeth</span>. &mdash; Wherefore was that cry?<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="t8">Seyton</span>. The queen, my lord, is dead.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="t8">Macbeth</span>. She should (a)have, died hereafter:<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There would have been a time for such a <span class="t8">word</span>.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To-morrow, and to-morrow, and to-morrow,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Creeps in this petty pace from day to day,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the last syllable of (b)recorded time;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all our yesterdays have lighted fools<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle!<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Life&rsquo;s but a walking shadow. &mdash; </p>
<p class="p26">&nbsp;(a) She should have died hereafter,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There would have been a time for such a <span class="t8">word</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">This passage has very justly been suspected of being corrupt. It is not apparent for what <span class="t8">word</span> there would have been a <span class="t8">time</span>, and that there would or would not be a <span class="t8">time</span> for any <span class="t8">word</span>, seems not a consideration of importance sufficient to transport Macbeth into the following exclamation. I read, therefore:</p>
<p class="p26">&nbsp;She should have died hereafter,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;There would have been a time for &mdash; such a <span class="t8">world!</span> &mdash; <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;To-morrow, &amp;c.</p>
<p class="p24">It is a broken speech, in which only part of the thought is expressed, and may be paraphrased thus: The queen is dead. <span class="t8">Macbeth</span>. Her death should have been deferred to some more peaceful hour; had she lived longer, <span class="t8">there would at length have been a time for</span> the honours due to her as a queen, and that respect which I owe her for her fidelity and love. Such is the <span class="t8">world</span> &mdash; such is the condition of human life, that we always think <span class="t8">to-morrow</span> will be happier than to-day; but to-morrow and to-morrow steals over us unenjoyed and unregarded, and we still linger in the same expectation to the moment appointed for our end. All these days, which have thus passed away, have sent multitudes of fools to the grave, who were engrossed by the same dream of future felicity, and, when life was departing from them, were, like me, reckoning on to- morrow.</p>
<p class="p24">(b) To the last syllable of recorded time.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Recorded time</span> seems to signify the time fixed in the decrees of heaven for the period of life. The <span class="t8">record</span> of <span class="t8">futurity</span> is, indeed, no accurate expression, but as we only know transactions past or present, the language of men affords no term for the volumes of prescience, in which future events may be supposed to be written.</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">NOTE XLV.</span></p>
<p class="p26">&nbsp;<span class="t8">Macbeth</span>. If thou speak&rsquo;st false.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the next tree shalt thou hang alive,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till famine cling thee: if thy speech be sooth,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I care not if thou dost for me as much. &mdash; <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I <span class="t8">pull</span> in resolution; and begin<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To doubt th&rsquo; equivocation of the fiend,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That lies like truth: &ldquo;Fear not till Birnam wood<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do come to Dunsinane,&rdquo; and now a wood<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Comes toward Dunsinane.</p>
<p class="p24">I <span class="t8">pull</span> in resolution. &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">Though this is the reading of all the editions, yet as it is a phrase without either example, elegance, or propriety, it is surely better to read:</p>
<p class="p24">I <span class="t8">pall</span> in resolution. &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">I languish in my constancy, my confidence begins to forsake me.</span> It is scarcely necessary to observe how easily <span class="t8">pall</span> might be changed into <span class="t8">pull</span> by a negligent writer, or mistaken for it by an unskilful printer.</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">NOTE XLVI.</span></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">SCENE VIII.</span></p>
<p class="p21"><span class="t8">Siward</span> Had I as many sons as I have hairs, I would not wish them to a fairer death: And so his knell is knoll&rsquo;d.</p>
<p class="p24">This incident is thus related from Henry of Huntingdon, by Camden, in his Remains, from which our author probably copied it.</p>
<p class="p24">When Siward, the martial Earl of Northumberland, understood that his son, whom he had sent in service against the Scotchmen, was slain, he demanded whether his wound were in the fore part or hinder part of his body. When it was answered in the fore part, he replied, &ldquo;I am right glad; neither wish I any other death to me or mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">* * * * *</p>
<p class="p24">After the foregoing pages were printed, the late edition of Shakespeare, ascribed to Sir Thomas Hanmer, fell into my hands; and it was, therefore, convenient for me to delay the publication of my remarks, till I had examined whether they were not anticipated by similar observations, or precluded by better. I, therefore, read over this tragedy, but found that the editor&rsquo;s apprehension is of a cast so different from mine, that he appears to find no difficulty in most of those passages which I have represented as unintelligible, and has, therefore, passed smoothly over them, without any attempt to alter or explain them.</p>
<p class="p24">Some of the lines with which I had been perplexed, have been, indeed, so fortunate as to attract his regard; and it is not without all the satisfaction which it is usual to express on such occasions, that I find an entire agreement between us in substituting [see Note II.] <span class="t8">quarrel</span> for <span class="t8">quarry</span>, and in explaining the adage of the cat, [Note XVII.] But this pleasure is, like most others, known only to be regretted; for I have the unhappiness to find no such conformity with regard to any other passage.</p>
<p class="p24">The line which I have endeavoured to amend, Note XI. is, likewise, attempted by the new editor, and is, perhaps, the only passage in the play in which he has not submissively admitted the emendations of foregoing criticks. Instead of the common reading,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&mdash; Doing every thing <span class="t8">Safe</span> towards your love and honour,</p>
<p class="p24">he has published,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&mdash; Doing every thing <span class="t8">Shap&rsquo;d</span> towards your love and honour.</p>
<p class="p24">This alteration, which, like all the rest attempted by him, the reader is expected to admit, without any reason alleged in its defence, is, in my opinion, more plausible than that of Mr. Theobald: whether it is right, I am not to determine.</p>
<p class="p24">In the passage which I have altered in Note XL. an emendation is, likewise, attempted in the late edition, where, for,</p>
<p class="p26">&nbsp;&mdash; and the chance <span class="t8">of</span> goodness<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Be like our warranted quarrel,</p>
<p class="p24">is substituted &mdash; and the chance <span class="t8">in</span> goodness &mdash; whether with more or less elegance, dignity, and propriety, than the reading which I have offered, I must again decline the province of deciding.</p>
<p class="p24">Most of the other emendations which he has endeavoured, whether with good or bad fortune, are too trivial to deserve mention. For surely the weapons of criticism ought not to be blunted against an editor, who can imagine that he is restoring poetry, while he is amusing himself with alterations like these: for,</p>
<p class="p26">&nbsp;&mdash; This is the sergeant,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Who like a good and hardy soldier fought;<br/>&nbsp;&mdash; This is the sergeant, who<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a <span class="t8">right</span> good and hardy soldier fought.</p>
<p class="p24">For,</p>
<p class="p26">&nbsp;&mdash; Dismay&rsquo;d not this<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our captains Macbeth and Banquo? &mdash; Yes;</p>
<p class="p26">&nbsp;&mdash; Dismay&rsquo;d not this<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our captains <span class="t8">brave</span> Macbeth and Banquo? &mdash; Yes.</p>
<p class="p24">Such harmless industry may, surely, be forgiven, if it cannot be praised: may he, therefore, never want a monosyllable, who can use it with such wonderful dexterity.</p>
<p class="p24">Rumpatur quisquis rumpitur invidia!</p>
<p class="p24">The rest of this edition I have not read, but, from the little that I have seen, think it not dangerous to declare that, in my opinion, its pomp recommends it more than its accuracy. There is no distinction made between the ancient reading, and the innovations of the editor; there is no reason given for any of the alterations which are made; the emendations of former criticks are adopted without any acknowledgment, and few of the difficulties are removed which have hitherto embarrassed the readers of Shakespeare.</p>
<p class="p24">I would not, however, be thought to insult the editor, nor to censure him with too much petulance, for having failed in little things, of whom I have been told, that he excels in greater. But I may, without indecency, observe, that no man should attempt to teach others what he has never learned himself; and that those who, like Themistocles, have studied the arts of policy, and &ldquo;can teach a small state how to grow great,&rdquo; should, like him, disdain to labour in trifles, and consider petty accomplishments as below their ambition.</p>
