<title>THE LIFE OF SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.</title>
</head>
<body>
<h2 class="h20"><a id="a2647"></a>THE LIFE OF SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.</h2>
<p class="p21">To write the Life of him who excelled all mankind in writing the lives of others, and who, whether we consider his extraordinary endowments, or his various works, has been equalled by few in any age, is an arduous, and may be reckoned in me a presumptuous task.</p>
<p class="p24">Had Dr. Johnson written his own life, in conformity with the opinion which he has given, that every man&rsquo;s life may be best written by himself; had he employed in the preservation of his own history, that clearness of narration and elegance of language in which he has embalmed so many eminent persons, the world would probably have had the most perfect example of biography that was ever exhibited. But although he at different times, in a desultory manner, committed to writing many particulars of the progress of his mind and fortunes, he never had persevering diligence enough to form them into a regular composition. Of these memorials a few have been preserved; but the greater part was consigned by him to the flames, a few days before his death.</p>
<p class="p24">As I had the honour and happiness of enjoying his friendship for upwards of twenty years; as I had the scheme of writing his life constantly in view; as he was well apprised of this circumstance, and from time to time obligingly satisfied my inquiries, by communicating to me the incidents of his early years; as I acquired a facility in recollecting, and was very assiduous in recording, his conversation, of which the extraordinary vigour and vivacity constituted one of the first features of his character; and as I have spared no pains in obtaining materials concerning him, from every quarter where I could discover that they were to be found, and have been favoured with the most liberal communications by his friends; I flatter myself that few biographers have entered upon such a work as this, with more advantages; independent of literary abilities, in which I am not vain enough to compare myself with some great names who have gone before me in this kind of writing.</p>
<p class="p24">Since my work was announced, several Lives and Memoirs of Dr. Johnson have been published, the most voluminous of which is one compiled for the booksellers of London, by Sir John Hawkins, Knight, a man, whom, during my long intimacy with Dr. Johnson, I never saw in his company, I think but once, and I am sure not above twice. Johnson might have esteemed him for his decent, religious demeanour, and his knowledge of books and literary history; but from the rigid formality of his manners, it is evident that they never could have lived together with companionable ease and familiarity; nor had Sir John Hawkins that nice perception which was necessary to mark the finer and less obvious parts of Johnson&rsquo;s character. His being appointed one of his executors, gave him an opportunity of taking possession of such fragments of a diary and other papers as were left; of which, before delivering them up to the residuary legatee, whose property they were, he endeavoured to extract the substance. In this he has not been very successful, as I have found upon a perusal of those papers, which have been since transferred to me. Sir John Hawkins&rsquo;s ponderous labours, I must acknowledge, exhibit a <span class="t8">farrago</span>, of which a considerable portion is not devoid of entertainment to the lovers of literary gossiping; but besides its being swelled out with long unnecessary extracts from various works (even one of several leaves from Osborne&rsquo;s Harleian Catalogue, and those not compiled by Johnson, but by Oldys), a very small part of it relates to the person who is the subject of the book; and, in that, there is such an inaccuracy in the statement of facts, as in so solemn an authour is hardly excusable, and certainly makes his narrative very unsatisfactory. But what is still worse, there is throughout the whole of it a dark uncharitable cast, by which the most unfavourable construction is put upon almost every circumstance in the character and conduct of my illustrious friend; who, I trust, will, by a true and fair delineation, be vindicated both from the injurious misrepresentations of this authour, and from the slighter aspersions of a lady who once lived in great intimacy with him.</p>
<p class="p24">There is, in the British Museum, a letter from Bishop Warburton to Dr. Birch, on the subject of biography; which, though I am aware it may expose me to a charge of artfully raising the value of my own work, by contrasting it with that of which I have spoken, is so well conceived and expressed, that I cannot refrain from here inserting it: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I shall endeavor, (says Dr. Warburton,) to give you what satisfaction I can in any thing you want to be satisfied in any subject of Milton, and am extremely glad you intend to write his life. Almost all the life-writers we have had before Toland and Desmaiseaux, are indeed strange insipid creatures; and yet I had rather read the worst of them, than be obliged to go through with this of Milton&rsquo;s, or the other&rsquo;s life of Boileau, where there is such a dull, heavy succession of long quotations of disinteresting passages, that it makes their method quite nauseous. But the verbose, tasteless Frenchman seems to lay it down as a principle, that every life must be a book, and what&rsquo;s worse, it proves a book without a life; for what do we know of Boileau, after all his tedious stuff? You are the only one, (and I speak it without a compliment) that by the vigour of your stile and sentiments, and the real importance of your materials, have the art, (which one would imagine no one could have missed,) of adding agreements to the most agreeable subject in the world, which is literary history.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Nov. 24, 1737.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Instead of melting down my materials into one mass, and constantly speaking in my own person, by which I might have appeared to have more merit in the execution of the work, I have resolved to adopt and enlarge upon the excellent plan of Mr. Mason, in his Memoirs of Gray. Wherever narrative is necessary to explain, connect, and supply, I furnish it to the best of my abilities; but in the chronological series of Johnson&rsquo;s life, which I trace as distinctly as I can, year by year, I produce, wherever it is in my power, his own minutes, letters, or conversation, being convinced that this mode is more lively, and will make my readers better acquainted with him, than even most of those were who actually knew him, but could know him only partially; whereas there is here an accumulation of intelligence from various points, by which his character is more fully understood and illustrated.</p>
<p class="p24">Indeed I cannot conceive a more perfect mode of writing any man&rsquo;s life, than not only relating all the most important events of it in their order, but interweaving what he privately wrote, and said, and thought; by which mankind are enabled as it were to see him live, and to &lsquo;live o&rsquo;er each scene&rsquo; with him, as he actually advanced through the several stages of his life. Had his other friends been as diligent and ardent as I was, he might have been almost entirely preserved. As it is, I will venture to say that he will be seen in this work more completely than any man who has ever yet lived.</p>
<p class="p24">And he will be seen as he really was; for I profess to write, not his panegyrick, which must be all praise, but his Life; which, great and good as he was, must not be supposed to be entirely perfect. To be as he was, is indeed subject of panegyrick enough to any man in this state of being; but in every picture there should be shade as well as light, and when I delineate him without reserve, I do what he himself recommended, both by his precept and his example.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;If the biographer writes from personal knowledge, and makes haste to gratify the publick curiosity, there is danger lest his interest, his fear, his gratitude, or his tenderness overpower his fidelity, and tempt him to conceal, if not to invent. There are many who think it an act of piety to hide the faults or failings of their friends, even when they can no longer suffer by their detection; we therefore see whole ranks of characters adorned with uniform panegyrick, and not to be known from one another but by extrinsick and casual circumstances. &ldquo;Let me remember, (says Hale,) when I find myself inclined to pity a criminal, that there is likewise a pity due to the country.&rdquo; If we owe regard to the memory of the dead, there is yet more respect to be paid to knowledge, to virtue and to truth.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">What I consider as the peculiar value of the following work, is, the quantity it contains of Johnson&rsquo;s conversation; which is universally acknowledged to have been eminently instructive and entertaining; and of which the specimens that I have given upon a former occasion, have been received with so much approbation, that I have good grounds for supposing that the world will not be indifferent to more ample communications of a similar nature.</p>
<p class="p24">That the conversation of a celebrated man, if his talents have been exerted in conversation, will best display his character, is, I trust, too well established in the judgment of mankind, to be at all shaken by a sneering observation of Mr. Mason, in his <span class="t8">Memoirs of Mr. William Whitehead</span>, in which there is literally no <span class="t8">Life</span>, but a mere dry narrative of facts. I do not think it was quite necessary to attempt a depreciation of what is universally esteemed, because it was not to be found in the immediate object of the ingenious writer&rsquo;s pen; for in truth, from a man so still and so tame, as to be contented to pass many years as the domestick companion of a superannuated lord and lady, conversation could no more be expected, than from a Chinese mandarin on a chimney-piece, or the fantastick figures on a gilt leather skreen.</p>
<p class="p24">If authority be required, let us appeal to Plutarch, the prince of ancient biographers. [Greek: Oute tais epiphanestatais praxesi pantos enesti daelosis aretaes ae kakias, alla pragma brachu pollakis, kai raema, kai paidia tis emphasin aethous epoiaesen mallon ae machai murionekroi, kai parataxeis ai megistai, kai poliorkiai poleon.] Nor is it always in the most distinguished atchievements that men&rsquo;s virtues or vices may be best discerned; but very often an action of small note, a short saying, or a jest, shall distinguish a person&rsquo;s real character more than the greatest sieges, or the most important battles.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">To this may be added the sentiments of the very man whose life I am about to exhibit.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The business of the biographer is often to pass slightly over those performances and incidents which produce vulgar greatness, to lead the thoughts into domestick privacies, and display the minute details of daily life, where exteriour appendages are cast aside, and men excel each other only by prudence and by virtue. The account of Thuanus is with great propriety said by its authour to have been written, that it might lay open to posterity the private and familiar character of that man, <span class="t8">cujus ingenium et candorem ex ipsius scriptis sunt olim semper miraturi</span>, whose candour and genius will to the end of time be by his writings preserved in admiration.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;There are many invisible circumstances, which whether we read as enquirers after natural or moral knowledge, whether we intend to enlarge our science, or increase our virtue, are more important than publick occurrences. Thus Sallust, the great master of nature, has not forgot in his account of Catiline to remark, that his walk was now quick, and again slow, as an indication of a mind revolving with violent commotion. Thus the story of Melanchthon affords a striking lecture on the value of time, by informing us, that when he had made an appointment, he expected not only the hour, but the minute to be fixed, that the day might not run out in the idleness of suspence; and all the plans and enterprises of De Witt are now of less importance to the world than that part of his personal character, which represents him as careful of his health, and negligent of his life.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;But biography has often been allotted to writers, who seem very little acquainted with the nature of their task, or very negligent about the performance. They rarely afford any other account than might be collected from publick papers, but imagine themselves writing a life, when they exhibit a chronological series of actions or preferments; and have so little regard to the manners or behaviour of their heroes, that more knowledge may be gained of a man&rsquo;s real character, by a short conversation with one of his servants, than from a formal and studied narrative, begun with his pedigree, and ended with his funeral.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;There are indeed, some natural reasons why these narratives are often written by such as were not likely to give much instruction or delight, and why most accounts of particular persons are barren and useless. If a life be delayed till interest and envy are at an end, we may hope for impartiality, but must expect little intelligence; for the incidents which give excellence to biography are of a volatile and evanescent kind, such as soon escape the memory, and are transmitted by tradition. We know how few can pourtray a living acquaintance, except by his most prominent and observable particularities, and the grosser features of his mind; and it may be easily imagined how much of this little knowledge may be lost in imparting it, and how soon a succession of copies will lose all resemblance of the original.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I am fully aware of the objections which may be made to the minuteness on some occasions of my detail of Johnson&rsquo;s conversation, and how happily it is adapted for the petty exercise of ridicule, by men of superficial understanding and ludicrous fancy; but I remain firm and confident in my opinion, that minute particulars are frequently characteristick, and always amusing, when they relate to a distinguished man. I am therefore exceedingly unwilling that any thing, however slight, which my illustrious friend thought it worth his while to express, with any degree of point, should perish. For this almost superstitious reverence, I have found very old and venerable authority, quoted by our great modern prelate, Secker, in whose tenth sermon there is the following passage:</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;<span class="t8">Rabbi David Kimchi</span>, a noted Jewish Commentator, who lived about five hundred years ago, explains that passage in the first Psalm, <span class="t8">His leaf also shall not wither</span>, from Rabbins yet older than himself, thus: That <span class="t8">even the idle talk</span>, so he expresses it, <span class="t8">of a good man ought to be regarded</span>; the most superfluous things he saith are always of some value. And other ancient authours have the same phrase, nearly in the same sense.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Of one thing I am certain, that considering how highly the small portion which we have of the table-talk and other anecdotes of our celebrated writers is valued, and how earnestly it is regretted that we have not more, I am justified in preserving rather too many of Johnson&rsquo;s sayings, than too few; especially as from the diversity of dispositions it cannot be known with certainty beforehand, whether what may seem trifling to some and perhaps to the collector himself, may not be most agreeable to many; and the greater number that an authour can please in any degree, the more pleasure does there arise to a benevolent mind.</p>
<p class="p24">To those who are weak enough to think this a degrading task, and the time and labour which have been devoted to it misemployed, I shall content myself with opposing the authority of the greatest man of any age, JULIUS CÆSAR, of whom Bacon observes, that &lsquo;in his book of Apothegms which he collected, we see that he esteemed it more honour to make himself but a pair of tables, to take the wise and pithy words of others, than to have every word of his own to be made an apothegm or an oracle.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Having said thus much by way of introduction, I commit the following pages to the candour of the Publick.</p>
<p class="p10">* * * * *</p>
<p class="p21">SAMUEL JOHNSON was born at Lichfield, in Staffordshire, on the 18th of September, N.S., 1709; and his initiation into the Christian Church was not delayed; for his baptism is recorded, in the register of St. Mary&rsquo;s parish in that city, to have been performed on the day of his birth. His father is there stiled <span class="t8">Gentleman</span>, a circumstance of which an ignorant panegyrist has praised him for not being proud; when the truth is, that the appellation of Gentleman, though now lost in the indiscriminate assumption of <span class="t8">Esquire</span>, was commonly taken by those who could not boast of gentility. His father was Michael Johnson, a native of Derbyshire, of obscure extraction, who settled in Lichfield as a bookseller and stationer.</p>
<p class="p24">His mother was Sarah Ford, descended of an ancient race of substantial yeomanry in Warwickshire. They were well advanced in years when they married, and never had more than two children, both sons; Samuel, their first born, who lived to be the illustrious character whose various excellence I am to endeavour to record, and Nathanael, who died in his twenty-fifth year.</p>
<p class="p24">Mr. Michael Johnson was a man of a large and robust body, and of a strong and active mind; yet, as in the most solid rocks veins of unsound substance are often discovered, there was in him a mixture of that disease, the nature of which eludes the most minute enquiry, though the effects are well known to be a weariness of life, an unconcern about those things which agitate the greater part of mankind, and a general sensation of gloomy wretchedness. From him then his son inherited, with some other qualities, &lsquo;a vile melancholy,&rsquo; which in his too strong expression of any disturbance of the mind, &lsquo;made him mad all his life, at least not sober.&rsquo; Michael was, however, forced by the narrowness of his circumstances to be very diligent in business, not only in his shop, but by occasionally resorting to several towns in the neighbourhood, some of which were at a considerable distance from Lichfield. At that time booksellers&rsquo; shops in the provincial towns of England were very rare, so that there was not one even in Birmingham, in which town old Mr. Johnson used to open a shop every market-day. He was a pretty good Latin scholar, and a citizen so creditable as to be made one of the magistrates of Lichfield; and, being a man of good sense, and skill in his trade, he acquired a reasonable share of wealth, of which however he afterwards lost the greatest part, by engaging unsuccessfully in a manufacture of parchment. He was a zealous high-church man and royalist, and retained his attachment to the unfortunate house of Stuart, though he reconciled himself, by casuistical arguments of expediency and necessity, to take the oaths imposed by the prevailing power.</p>
<p class="p24">There is a circumstance in his life somewhat romantick, but so well authenticated, that I shall not omit it. A young woman of Leek, in Staffordshire, while he served his apprenticeship there, conceived a violent passion for him; and though it met with no favourable return, followed him to Lichfield, where she took lodgings opposite to the house in which he lived, and indulged her hopeless flame. When he was informed that it so preyed upon her mind that her life was in danger, he with a generous humanity went to her and offered to marry her, but it was then too late: her vital power was exhausted; and she actually exhibited one of the very rare instances of dying for love. She was buried in the cathedral of Lichfield; and he, with a tender regard, placed a stone over her grave with this inscription:</p>
<p class="p24">Here lies the body of</p>
<p class="p24">Mrs. ELIZABETH BLANEY, a stranger.</p>
<p class="p24">She departed this life</p>
<p class="p24">20 of September, 1694.</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson&rsquo;s mother was a woman of distinguished understanding. I asked his old school-fellow, Mr. Hector, surgeon of Birmingham, if she was not vain of her son. He said, &lsquo;she had too much good sense to be vain, but she knew her son&rsquo;s value.&rsquo; Her piety was not inferiour to her understanding; and to her must be ascribed those early impressions of religion upon the mind of her son, from which the world afterwards derived so much benefit. He told me, that he remembered distinctly having had the first notice of Heaven, &lsquo;a place to which good people went,&rsquo; and hell, &lsquo;a place to which bad people went,&rsquo; communicated to him by her, when a little child in bed with her; and that it might be the better fixed in his memory, she sent him to repeat it to Thomas Jackson, their man-servant; he not being in the way, this was not done; but there was no occasion for any artificial aid for its preservation.</p>
<p class="p24">In following so very eminent a man from his cradle to his grave, every minute particular, which can throw light on the progress of his mind, is interesting. That he was remarkable, even in his earliest years, may easily be supposed; for to use his own words in his Life of Sydenham,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;That the strength of his understanding, the accuracy of his discernment, and ardour of his curiosity, might have been remarked from his infancy, by a diligent observer, there is no reason to doubt. For, there is no instance of any man, whose history has been minutely related, that did not in every part of life discover the same proportion of intellectual vigour.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">In all such investigations it is certainly unwise to pay too much attention to incidents which the credulous relate with eager satisfaction, and the more scrupulous or witty enquirer considers only as topicks of ridicule: Yet there is a traditional story of the infant Hercules of toryism, so curiously characteristick, that I shall not withhold it. It was communicated to me in a letter from Miss Mary Adye, of Lichfield:</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;When Dr. Sacheverel was at Lichfield, Johnson was not quite three years old. My grandfather Hammond observed him at the cathedral perched upon his father&rsquo;s shoulders, listening and gaping at the much celebrated preacher. Mr. Hammond asked Mr. Johnson how he could possibly think of bringing such an infant to church, and in the midst of so great a croud. He answered, because it was impossible to keep him at home; for, young as he was, he believed he had caught the publick spirit and zeal for Sacheverel, and would have staid for ever in the church, satisfied with beholding him.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Nor can I omit a little instance of that jealous independence of spirit, and impetuosity of temper, which never forsook him. The fact was acknowledged to me by himself, upon the authority of his mother. One day, when the servant who used to be sent to school to conduct him home, had not come in time, he set out by himself, though he was then so near-sighted, that he was obliged to stoop down on his hands and knees to take a view of the kennel before he ventured to step over it. His school-mistress, afraid that he might miss his way, or fall into the kennel, or be run over by a cart, followed him at some distance. He happened to turn about and perceive her. Feeling her careful attention as an insult to his manliness, he ran back to her in a rage, and beat her, as well as his strength would permit.</p>
<p class="p24">Of the power of his memory, for which he was all his life eminent to a degree almost incredible, the following early instance was told me in his presence at Lichfield, in 1776, by his step-daughter, Mrs. Lucy Porter, as related to her by his mother.</p>
<p class="p24">When he was a child in petticoats, and had learnt to read, Mrs. Johnson one morning put the common prayer-book into his hands, pointed to the collect for the day, and said, &lsquo;Sam, you must get this by heart.&rsquo; She went up stairs, leaving him to study it: But by the time she had reached the second floor, she heard him following her. &lsquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rsquo; said she. &lsquo;I can say it,&rsquo; he replied; and repeated it distinctly, though he could not have read it more than twice.</p>
<p class="p24">But there has been another story of his infant precocity generally circulated, and generally believed, the truth of which I am to refute upon his own authority. It is told, that, when a child of three years old, he chanced to tread upon a duckling, the eleventh of a brood, and killed it; upon which, it is said, he dictated to his mother the following epitaph:</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;Here lies good master duck,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Whom Samuel Johnson trod on;<br/>If it had liv&rsquo;d, it had been <span class="t8">good luck</span>,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;For then we&rsquo;d had an <span class="t8">odd one</span>.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">There is surely internal evidence that this little composition combines in it, what no child of three years old could produce, without an extension of its faculties by immediate inspiration; yet Mrs. Lucy Porter, Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s step-daughter, positively maintained to me, in his presence, that there could be no doubt of the truth of this anecdote, for she had heard it from his mother. So difficult is it to obtain an authentick relation of facts, and such authority may there be for errour; for he assured me, that his father made the verses, and wished to pass them for his child&rsquo;s. He added, &lsquo;my father was a foolish old man; that is to say, foolish in talking of his children.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Young Johnson had the misfortune to be much afflicted with the scrophula, or king&rsquo;s evil, which disfigured a countenance naturally well formed, and hurt his visual nerves so much, that he did not see at all with one of his eyes, though its appearance was little different from that of the other. There is amongst his prayers, one inscribed &lsquo;<span class="t8">When my</span> EYE <span class="t8">was restored to its use</span>,&rsquo; which ascertains a defect that many of his friends knew he had, though I never perceived it. I supposed him to be only near-sighted; and indeed I must observe, that in no other respect could I discern any defect in his vision; on the contrary, the force of his attention and perceptive quickness made him see and distinguish all manner of objects, whether of nature or of art, with a nicety that is rarely to be found. When he and I were travelling in the Highlands of Scotland, and I pointed out to him a mountain which I observed resembled a cone, he corrected my inaccuracy, by shewing me, that it was indeed pointed at the top, but that one side of it was larger than the other. And the ladies with whom he was acquainted agree, that no man was more nicely and minutely critical in the elegance of female dress. When I found that he saw the romantick beauties of Islam, in Derbyshire, much better than I did, I told him that he resembled an able performer upon a bad instrument. How false and contemptible then are all the remarks which have been made to the prejudice either of his candour or of his philosophy, founded upon a supposition that he was almost blind. It has been said, that he contracted this grievous malady from his nurse. His mother yielding to the superstitious notion, which, it is wonderful to think, prevailed so long in this country, as to the virtue of the regal touch; a notion, which our kings encouraged, and to which a man of such inquiry and such judgement as Carte could give credit; carried him to London, where he was actually touched by Queen Anne. Mrs. Johnson indeed, as Mr. Hector informed me, acted by the advice of the celebrated Sir John Floyer, then a physician in Lichfield. Johnson used to talk of this very frankly; and Mrs. Piozzi has preserved his very picturesque description of the scene, as it remained upon his fancy. Being asked if he could remember Queen Anne, &lsquo;He had (he said) a confused, but somehow a sort of solemn recollection of a lady in diamonds, and a long black hood.&rsquo; This touch, however, was without any effect. I ventured to say to him, in allusion to the political principles in which he was educated, and of which he ever retained some odour, that &lsquo;his mother had not carried him far enough; she should have taken him to ROME.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He was first taught to read English by Dame Oliver, a widow, who kept a school for young children in Lichfield. He told me she could read the black letter, and asked him to borrow for her, from his father, a bible in that character. When he was going to Oxford, she came to take leave of him, brought him, in the simplicity of her kindness, a present of gingerbread, and said, he was the best scholar she ever had. He delighted in mentioning this early compliment: adding, with a smile, that &lsquo;this was as high a proof of his merit as he could conceive.&rsquo; His next instructor in English was a master, whom, when he spoke of him to me, he familiarly called Tom Brown, who, said he, &lsquo;published a spelling-book, and dedicated it to the UNIVERSE; but, I fear, no copy of it can now be had.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He began to learn Latin with Mr. Hawkins, usher, or under-master of Lichfield school, &lsquo;a man (said he) very skilful in his little way.&rsquo; With him he continued two years, and then rose to be under the care of Mr. Hunter, the head-master, who, according to his account, &lsquo;was very severe, and wrong-headedly severe. He used (said he) to beat us unmercifully; and he did not distinguish between ignorance and negligence; for he would beat a boy equally for not knowing a thing, as for neglecting to know it. He would ask a boy a question; and if he did not answer it, he would beat him, without considering whether he had an opportunity of knowing how to answer it. For instance, he would call up a boy and ask him Latin for a candlestick, which the boy could not expect to be asked. Now, Sir, if a boy could answer every question, there would be no need of a master to teach him.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">It is, however, but justice to the memory of Mr. Hunter to mention, that though he might err in being too severe, the school of Lichfield was very respectable in his time. The late Dr. Taylor, Prebendary of Westminster, who was educated under him, told me, that &lsquo;he was an excellent master, and that his ushers were most of them men of eminence; that Holbrook, one of the most ingenious men, best scholars, and best preachers of his age, was usher during the greatest part of the time that Johnson was at school. Then came Hague, of whom as much might be said, with the addition that he was an elegant poet. Hague was succeeded by Green, afterwards Bishop of Lincoln, whose character in the learned world is well known. In the same form with Johnson was Congreve, who afterwards became chaplain to Archbishop Boulter, and by that connection obtained good preferment in Ireland. He was a younger son of the ancient family of Congreve, in Staffordshire, of which the poet was a branch. His brother sold the estate. There was also Lowe, afterwards Canon of Windsor.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Indeed Johnson was very sensible how much he owed to Mr. Hunter. Mr. Langton one day asked him how he had acquired so accurate a knowledge of Latin, in which, I believe, he was exceeded by no man of his time; he said, &lsquo;My master whipt me very well. Without that, Sir, I should have done nothing.&rsquo; He told Mr. Langton, that while Hunter was flogging his boys unmercifully, he used to say, &lsquo;And this I do to save you from the gallows.&rsquo; Johnson, upon all occasions, expressed his approbation of enforcing instruction by means of the rod. &lsquo;I would rather (said he) have the rod to be the general terrour to all, to make them learn, than tell a child, if you do thus, or thus, you will be more esteemed than your brothers or sisters. The rod produces an effect which terminates in itself. A child is afraid of being whipped, and gets his task, and there&rsquo;s an end on&rsquo;t; whereas, by exciting emulation and comparisons of superiority, you lay the foundation of lasting mischief; you make brothers and sisters hate each other.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">When Johnson saw some young ladies in Lincolnshire who were remarkably well behaved, owing to their mother&rsquo;s strict discipline and severe correction, he exclaimed, in one of Shakspeare&rsquo;s lines a little varied,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;<span class="t8">Rod</span>, I will honour thee for this thy duty.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">That superiority over his fellows, which he maintained with so much dignity in his march through life, was not assumed from vanity and ostentation, but was the natural and constant effect of those extraordinary powers of mind, of which he could not but be conscious by comparison; the intellectual difference, which in other cases of comparison of characters, is often a matter of undecided contest, being as clear in his case as the superiority of stature in some men above others. Johnson did not strut or stand on tip-toe: He only did not stoop. From his earliest years his superiority was perceived and acknowledged. He was from the beginning [Greek: anax andron], a king of men. His schoolfellow, Mr. Hector, has obligingly furnished me with many particulars of his boyish days: and assured me that he never knew him corrected at school, but for talking and diverting other boys from their business. He seemed to learn by intuition; for though indolence and procrastination were inherent in his constitution, whenever he made an exertion he did more than any one else. In short, he is a memorable instance of what has been often observed, that the boy is the man in miniature: and that the distinguishing characteristicks of each individual are the same, through the whole course of life. His favourites used to receive very liberal assistance from him; and such was the submission and deference with which he was treated, such the desire to obtain his regard, that three of the boys, of whom Mr. Hector was sometimes one, used to come in the morning as his humble attendants, and carry him to school. One in the middle stooped, while he sat upon his back, and one on each side supported him; and thus he was borne triumphant. Such a proof of the early predominance of intellectual vigour is very remarkable, and does honour to human nature. Talking to me once himself of his being much distinguished at school, he told me, &lsquo;they never thought to raise me by comparing me to any one; they never said, Johnson is as good a scholar as such a one; but such a one is as good a scholar as Johnson; and this was said but of one, but of Lowe; and I do not think he was as good a scholar.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He discovered a great ambition to excel, which roused him to counteract his indolence. He was uncommonly inquisitive; and his memory was so tenacious, that he never forgot any thing that he either heard or read. Mr. Hector remembers having recited to him eighteen verses, which, after a little pause, he repeated <span class="t8">verbatim</span>, varying only one epithet, by which he improved the line.</p>
<p class="p24">He never joined with the other boys in their ordinary diversions: his only amusement was in winter, when he took a pleasure in being drawn upon the ice by a boy barefooted, who pulled him along by a garter fixed round him; no very easy operation, as his size was remarkably large. His defective sight, indeed, prevented him from enjoying the common sports; and he once pleasantly remarked to me, &lsquo;how wonderfully well he had contrived to be idle without them.&rsquo; Lord Chesterfield, however, has justly observed in one of his letters, when earnestly cautioning a friend against the pernicious effects of idleness, that active sports are not to be reckoned idleness in young people; and that the listless torpor of doing nothing, alone deserves that name. Of this dismal inertness of disposition, Johnson had all his life too great a share. Mr. Hector relates, that &lsquo;he could not oblige him more than by sauntering away the hours of vacation in the fields, during which he was more engaged in talking to himself than to his companion.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Dr. Percy, the Bishop of Dromore, who was long intimately acquainted with him, and has preserved a few anecdotes concerning him, regretting that he was not a more diligent collector, informs me, that &lsquo;when a boy he was immoderately fond of reading romances of chivalry, and he retained his fondness for them through life; so that (adds his Lordship) spending part of a summer at my parsonage-house in the country, he chose for his regular reading the old Spanish romance of <span class="t8">Felixmarte of Hircania</span>, in folio, which he read quite through. Yet I have heard him attribute to these extravagant fictions that unsettled turn of mind which prevented his ever fixing in any profession.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">1725: ÆTAT. 16. &mdash; After having resided for some time at the house of his uncle, Cornelius Ford, Johnson was, at the age of fifteen, removed to the school of Stourbridge, in Worcestershire, of which Mr. Wentworth was then master. This step was taken by the advice of his cousin, the Reverend Mr. Ford, a man in whom both talents and good dispositions were disgraced by licentiousness, but who was a very able judge of what was right.</p>
<p class="p24">At this school he did not receive so much benefit as was expected. It has been said, that he acted in the capacity of an assistant to Mr. Wentworth, in teaching the younger boys. &lsquo;Mr. Wentworth (he told me) was a very able man, but an idle man, and to me very severe; but I cannot blame him much. I was then a big boy; he saw I did not reverence him; and that he should get no honour by me. I had brought enough with me, to carry me through; and all I should get at his school would be ascribed to my own labour, or to my former master. Yet he taught me a great deal.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He thus discriminated, to Dr. Percy, Bishop of Dromore, his progress at his two grammar-schools. &lsquo;At one, I learnt much in the school, but little from the master; in the other, I learnt much from the master, but little in the school.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">The Bishop also informs me, that &lsquo;Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s father, before he was received at Stourbridge, applied to have him admitted as a scholar and assistant to the Reverend Samuel Lea, M.A., head master of Newport school, in Shropshire (a very diligent, good teacher, at that time in high reputation, under whom Mr. Hollis is said, in the Memoirs of his Life, to have been also educated). This application to Mr. Lea was not successful; but Johnson had afterwards the gratification to hear that the old gentleman, who lived to a very advanced age, mentioned it as one of the most memorable events of his life, that &lsquo;he was very near having that great man for his scholar.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He remained at Stourbridge little more than a year, and then returned home, where he may be said to have loitered, for two years, in a state very unworthy his uncommon abilities. He had already given several proofs of his poetical genius, both in his school-exercises and in other occasional compositions. Of these I have obtained a considerable collection, by the favour of Mr. Wentworth, son of one of his masters, and of Mr. Hector, his school-fellow and friend; from which I select the following specimens:</p>

<p class="p24">The two years which he spent at home, after his return from Stourbridge, he passed in what he thought idleness, and was scolded by his father for his want of steady application. He had no settled plan of life, nor looked forward at all, but merely lived from day to day. Yet he read a great deal in a desultory manner, without any scheme of study, as chance threw books in his way, and inclination directed him through them. He used to mention one curious instance of his casual reading, when but a boy. Having imagined that his brother had hid some apples behind a large folio upon an upper shelf in his father&rsquo;s shop, he climbed up to search for them. There were no apples; but the large folio proved to be Petrarch, whom he had seen mentioned in some preface, as one of the restorers of learning. His curiosity having been thus excited, he sat down with avidity, and read a great part of the book. What he read during these two years he told me, was not works of mere amusement, &lsquo;not voyages and travels, but all literature, Sir, all ancient writers, all manly: though but little Greek, only some of Anacreon and Hesiod; but in this irregular manner (added he) I had looked into a great many books, which were not commonly known at the Universities, where they seldom read any books but what are put into their hands by their tutors; so that when I came to Oxford, Dr. Adams, now master of Pembroke College, told me I was the best qualified for the University that he had ever known come there.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">In estimating the progress of his mind during these two years, as well as in future periods of his life, we must not regard his own hasty confession of idleness; for we see, when he explains himself, that he was acquiring various stores; and, indeed he himself concluded the account with saying, &lsquo;I would not have you think I was doing nothing then.&rsquo; He might, perhaps, have studied more assiduously; but it may be doubted whether such a mind as his was not more enriched by roaming at large in the fields of literature than if it had been confined to any single spot. The analogy between body and mind is very general, and the parallel will hold as to their food, as well as any other particular. The flesh of animals who feed excursively, is allowed to have a higher flavour than that of those who are cooped up. May there not be the same difference between men who read as their taste prompts and men who are confined in cells and colleges to stated tasks?</p>
<p class="p24">That a man in Mr. Michael Johnson&rsquo;s circumstances should think of sending his son to the expensive University of Oxford, at his own charge, seems very improbable. The subject was too delicate to question Johnson upon. But I have been assured by Dr. Taylor that the scheme never would have taken place had not a gentleman of Shropshire, one of his schoolfellows, spontaneously undertaken to support him at Oxford, in the character of his companion; though, in fact, he never received any assistance whatever from that gentleman.</p>
<p class="p24">He, however, went to Oxford, and was entered a Commoner of Pembroke College on the 31st of October, 1728, being then in his nineteenth year.</p>
<p class="p24">The Reverend Dr. Adams, who afterwards presided over Pembroke College with universal esteem, told me he was present, and gave me some account of what passed on the night of Johnson&rsquo;s arrival at Oxford. On that evening, his father, who had anxiously accompanied him, found means to have him introduced to Mr. Jorden, who was to be his tutor. His being put under any tutor reminds us of what Wood says of Robert Burton, authour of the &lsquo;Anatomy of Melancholy,&rsquo; when elected student of Christ Church: &lsquo;for form&rsquo;s sake, <span class="t8">though he wanted not a tutor</span>, he was put under the tuition of Dr. John Bancroft, afterwards Bishop of Oxon.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">His father seemed very full of the merits of his son, and told the company he was a good scholar, and a poet, and wrote Latin verses. His figure and manner appeared strange to them; but he behaved modestly, and sat silent, till upon something which occurred in the course of conversation, he suddenly struck in and quoted Macrobius; and thus he gave the first impression of that more extensive reading in which he had indulged himself.</p>
<p class="p24">His tutor, Mr. Jorden, fellow of Pembroke, was not, it seems, a man of such abilities as we should conceive requisite for the instructor of Samuel Johnson, who gave me the following account of him. &lsquo;He was a very worthy man, but a heavy man, and I did not profit much by his instructions. Indeed, I did not attend him much. The first day after I came to college I waited upon him, and then staid away four. On the sixth, Mr. Jorden asked me why I had not attended. I answered I had been sliding in Christ-Church meadow. And this I said with as much nonchalance as I am now talking to you. I had no notion that I was wrong or irreverent to my tutor. BOSWELL: &lsquo;That, Sir, was great fortitude of mind.&rsquo; JOHNSON: &lsquo;No, Sir; stark insensibility.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">The fifth of November was at that time kept with great solemnity at Pembroke College, and exercises upon the subject of the day were required. Johnson neglected to perform his, which is much to be regretted; for his vivacity of imagination, and force of language, would probably have produced something sublime upon the gunpowder plot. To apologise for his neglect, he gave in a short copy of verses, entitled Somnium, containing a common thought; &lsquo;that the Muse had come to him in his sleep, and whispered, that it did not become him to write on such subjects as politicks; he should confine himself to humbler themes:&rsquo; but the versification was truly Virgilian.</p>
<p class="p24">He had a love and respect for Jorden, not for his literature, but for his worth. &lsquo;Whenever (said he) a young man becomes Jorden&rsquo;s pupil, he becomes his son.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Having given such a specimen of his poetical powers, he was asked by Mr. Jorden, to translate Pope&rsquo;s Messiah into Latin verse, as a Christmas exercise. He performed it with uncommon rapidity, and in so masterly a manner, that he obtained great applause from it, which ever after kept him high in the estimation of his College, and, indeed, of all the University.</p>
<p class="p24">It is said, that Mr. Pope expressed himself concerning it in terms of strong approbation. Dr. Taylor told me, that it was first printed for old Mr. Johnson, without the knowledge of his son, who was very angry when he heard of it. A Miscellany of Poems collected by a person of the name of Husbands, was published at Oxford in 1731. In that Miscellany Johnson&rsquo;s Translation of the Messiah appeared, with this modest motto from Scaliger&rsquo;s Poeticks. <span class="t8">Ex alieno ingenio Poeta, ex suo tantum versificator</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">I am not ignorant that critical objections have been made to this and other specimens of Johnson&rsquo;s Latin Poetry. I acknowledge myself not competent to decide on a question of such extreme nicety. But I am satisfied with the just and discriminative eulogy pronounced upon it by my friend Mr, Courtenay.</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;And with like ease his vivid lines assume<br/>The garb and dignity of ancient Rome. &mdash; <br/>Let college <span class="t8">verse-men</span> trite conceits express,<br/>Trick&rsquo;d out in splendid shreds of Virgil&rsquo;s dress;<br/>From playful Ovid cull the tinsel phrase,<br/>And vapid notions hitch in pilfer&rsquo;d lays:<br/>Then with mosaick art the piece combine,<br/>And boast the glitter of each dulcet line:<br/>Johnson adventur&rsquo;d boldly to transfuse<br/>His vigorous sense into the Latian muse;<br/>Aspir&rsquo;d to shine by unreflected light,<br/>And with a Roman&rsquo;s ardour <span class="t8">think</span> and write.<br/>He felt the tuneful Nine his breast inspire,<br/>And, like a master, wak&rsquo;d the soothing lyre:<br/>Horatian strains a grateful heart proclaim,<br/>While Sky&rsquo;s wild rocks resound his Thralia&rsquo;s name.<br/>Hesperia&rsquo;s plant, in some less skilful hands,<br/>To bloom a while, factitious heat demands:<br/>Though glowing Maro a faint warmth supplies,<br/>The sickly blossom in the hot-house dies:<br/>By Johnson&rsquo;s genial culture, art, and toil,<br/>Its root strikes deep, and owns the fost&rsquo;ring soil;<br/>Imbibes our sun through all its swelling veins,<br/>And grows a native of Britannia&rsquo;s plains.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">The &lsquo;morbid melancholy,&rsquo; which was lurking in his constitution, and to which we may ascribe those particularities, and that aversion to regular life, which, at a very early period, marked his character, gathered such strength in his twentieth year, as to afflict him in a dreadful manner. While he was at Lichfield, in the college vacation of the year 1729, he felt himself overwhelmed with an horrible hypochondria, with perpetual irritation, fretfulness, and impatience; and with a dejection, gloom, and despair, which made existence misery. From this dismal malady he never afterwards was perfectly relieved; and all his labours, and all his enjoyments, were but temporary interruptions of its baleful influence. How wonderful, how unsearchable are the ways of GOD! Johnson, who was blest with all the powers of genius and understanding in a degree far above the ordinary state of human nature, was at the same time visited with a disorder so afflictive, that they who know it by dire experience, will not envy his exalted endowments. That it was, in some degree, occasioned by a defect in his nervous system, that inexplicable part of our frame, appears highly probable. He told Mr. Paradise that he was sometimes so languid and inefficient, that he could not distinguish the hour upon the town-clock.</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson, upon the first violent attack of this disorder, strove to overcome it by forcible exertions. He frequently walked to Birmingham and back again, and tried many other expedients, but all in vain. His expression concerning it to me was &lsquo;I did not then know how to manage it.&rsquo; His distress became so intolerable, that he applied to Dr. Swinfen, physician in Lichfield, his god-father, and put into his hands a state of his case, written in Latin. Dr. Swinfen was so much struck with the extraordinary acuteness, research, and eloquence of this paper, that in his zeal for his godson he shewed it to several people. His daughter, Mrs. Desmoulins, who was many years humanely supported in Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s house in London, told me, that upon his discovering that Dr. Swinfen had communicated his case, he was so much offended, that he was never afterwards fully reconciled to him. He indeed had good reason to be offended; for though Dr. Swinfen&rsquo;s motive was good, he inconsiderately betrayed a matter deeply interesting and of great delicacy, which had been entrusted to him in confidence; and exposed a complaint of his young friend and patient, which, in the superficial opinion of the generality of mankind, is attended with contempt and disgrace.</p>
<p class="p24">But let not little men triumph upon knowing that Johnson was an HYPOCHONDRIACK, was subject to what the learned, philosophical, and pious Dr. Cheyne has so well treated under the title of &lsquo;The English Malady.&rsquo; Though he suffered severely from it, he was not therefore degraded. The powers of his great mind might be troubled, and their full exercise suspended at times; but the mind itself was ever entire. As a proof of this, it is only necessary to consider, that, when he was at the very worst, he composed that state of his own case, which shewed an uncommon vigour, not only of fancy and taste, but of judgement. I am aware that he himself was too ready to call such a complaint by the name of <span class="t8">madness</span>; in conformity with which notion, he has traced its gradations, with exquisite nicety, in one of the chapters of his RASSELAS. But there is surely a clear distinction between a disorder which affects only the imagination and spirits, while the judgement is sound, and a disorder by which the judgement itself is impaired. This distinction was made to me by the late Professor Gaubius of Leyden, physician to the Prince of Orange, in a conversation which I had with him several years ago, and he expanded it thus: &lsquo;If (said he) a man tells me that he is grievously disturbed, for that he <span class="t8">imagines</span> he sees a ruffian coming against him with a drawn sword, though at the same time he is <span class="t8">conscious</span> it is a delusion, I pronounce him to have a disordered imagination; but if a man tells me that he sees this, and in consternation calls to me to look at it, I pronounce him to be <span class="t8">mad</span>.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">It is a common effect of low spirits or melancholy, to make those who are afflicted with it imagine that they are actually suffering those evils which happen to be most strongly presented to their minds. Some have fancied themselves to be deprived of the use of their limbs, some to labour under acute diseases, others to be in extreme poverty; when, in truth, there was not the least reality in any of the suppositions; so that when the vapours were dispelled, they were convinced of the delusion. To Johnson, whose supreme enjoyment was the exercise of his reason, the disturbance or obscuration of that faculty was the evil most to be dreaded. Insanity, therefore, was the object of his most dismal apprehension; and he fancied himself seized by it, or approaching to it, at the very time when he was giving proofs of a more than ordinary soundness and vigour of judgement. That his own diseased imagination should have so far deceived him, is strange; but it is stranger still that some of his friends should have given credit to his groundless opinion, when they had such undoubted proofs that it was totally fallacious; though it is by no means surprising that those who wish to depreciate him, should, since his death, have laid hold of this circumstance, and insisted upon it with very unfair aggravation.</p>
<p class="p24">Amidst the oppression and distraction of a disease which very few have felt in its full extent, but many have experienced in a slighter degree, Johnson, in his writings, and in his conversation, never failed to display all the varieties of intellectual excellence. In his march through this world to a better, his mind still appeared grand and brilliant, and impressed all around him with the truth of Virgil&rsquo;s noble sentiment &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;<span class="t8">Igneus est ollis vigor et coelestis origo</span>.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">The history of his mind as to religion is an important article. I have mentioned the early impressions made upon his tender imagination by his mother, who continued her pious care with assiduity, but, in his opinion, not with judgement. &lsquo;Sunday (said he) was a heavy day to me when I was a boy. My mother confined me on that day, and made me read &ldquo;The Whole Duty of Man,&rdquo; from a great part of which I could derive no instruction. When, for instance, I had read the chapter on theft, which from my infancy I had been taught was wrong, I was no more convinced that theft was wrong than before; so there was no accession of knowledge. A boy should be introduced to such books, by having his attention directed to the arrangement, to the style, and other excellencies of composition; that the mind being thus engaged by an amusing variety of objects, may not grow weary.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He communicated to me the following particulars upon the subject of his religious progress. &lsquo;I fell into an inattention to religion, or an indifference about it, in my ninth year. The church at Lichfield, in which we had a seat, wanted reparation, so I was to go and find a seat in other churches; and having bad eyes, and being awkward about this, I used to go and read in the fields on Sunday. This habit continued till my fourteenth year; and still I find a great reluctance to go to church. I then became a sort of lax <span class="t8">talker</span> against religion, for I did not much <span class="t8">think</span> against it; and this lasted till I went to Oxford, where it would not be <span class="t8">suffered</span>. When at Oxford, I took up &lsquo;Law&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Serious Call to a Holy Life</span>,&rsquo; &lsquo;expecting to find it a dull book (as such books generally are), and perhaps to laugh at it. But I found Law quite an overmatch for me; and this was the first occasion of my thinking in earnest of religion, after I became capable of rational inquiry.&rsquo; From this time forward religion was the predominant object of his thoughts; though, with the just sentiments of a conscientious Christian, he lamented that his practice of its duties fell far short of what it ought to be.</p>
<p class="p24">This instance of a mind such as that of Johnson being first disposed, by an unexpected incident, to think with anxiety of the momentous concerns of eternity, and of &lsquo;what he should do to be saved,&rsquo; may for ever be produced in opposition to the superficial and sometimes profane contempt that has been thrown upon, those occasional impressions which it is certain many Christians have experienced; though it must be acknowledged that weak minds, from an erroneous supposition that no man is in a state of grace who has not felt a particular conversion, have, in some cases, brought a degree of ridicule upon them; a ridicule of which it is inconsiderate or unfair to make a general application.</p>
<p class="p24">How seriously Johnson was impressed with a sense of religion, even in the vigour of his youth, appears from the following passage in his minutes kept by way of diary: Sept. 7, 1736. I have this day entered upon my twenty-eighth year. &lsquo;Mayest thou, O God, enable me, for JESUS CHRIST&rsquo;S sake, to spend this in such a manner that I may receive comfort from it at the hour of death, and in the day of judgement! Amen.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">The particular course of his reading while at Oxford, and during the time of vacation which he passed at home, cannot be traced. Enough has been said of his irregular mode of study. He told me that from his earliest years he loved to read poetry, but hardly ever read any poem to an end; that he read Shakspeare at a period so early, that the speech of the ghost in Hamlet terrified him when he was alone; that Horace&rsquo;s Odes were the compositions in which he took most delight, and it was long before he liked his Epistles and Satires. He told me what he read <span class="t8">solidly</span> at Oxford was Greek; not the Grecian historians, but Homer and Euripides, and now and then a little Epigram; that the study of which he was the most fond was Metaphysicks, but he had not read much, even in that way. I always thought that he did himself injustice in his account of what he had read, and that he must have been speaking with reference to the vast portion of study which is possible, and to which a few scholars in the whole history of literature have attained; for when I once asked him whether a person, whose name I have now forgotten, studied hard, he answered &lsquo;No, Sir; I do not believe he studied hard. I never knew a man who studied hard. I conclude, indeed, from the effects, that some men have studied hard, as Bentley and Clarke.&rsquo; Trying him by that criterion upon which he formed his judgement of others, we may be absolutely certain, both from his writings and his conversation, that his reading was very extensive. Dr. Adam Smith, than whom few were better judges on this subject, once observed to me that &lsquo;Johnson knew more books than any man alive.&rsquo; He had a peculiar facility in seizing at once what was valuable in any book, without submitting to the labour of perusing it from beginning to end. He had, from the irritability of his constitution, at all times, an impatience and hurry when he either read or wrote. A certain apprehension, arising from novelty, made him write his first exercise at College twice over; but he never took that trouble with any other composition; and we shall see that his most excellent works were struck off at a heat, with rapid exertion.</p>
<p class="p24">Yet he appears, from his early notes or memorandums in my possession, to have at various times attempted, or at least planned, a methodical course of study, according to computation, of which he was all his life fond, as it fixed his attention steadily upon something without, and prevented his mind from preying upon itself. Thus I find in his hand-writing the number of lines in each of two of Euripides&rsquo; Tragedies, of the Georgicks of Virgil, of the first six books of the Æneid, of Horace&rsquo;s Art of Poetry, of three of the books of Ovid&rsquo;s Metamorphosis, of some parts of Theocritus, and of the tenth Satire of Juvenal; and a table, shewing at the rate of various numbers a day (I suppose verses to be read), what would be, in each case, the total amount in a week, month, and year.</p>
<p class="p24">No man had a more ardent love of literature, or a higher respect for it than Johnson. His apartment in Pembroke College was that upon the second floor, over the gateway. The enthusiasts of learning will ever contemplate it with veneration. One day, while he was sitting in it quite alone, Dr. Panting, then master of the College, whom he called &lsquo;a fine Jacobite fellow,&rsquo; overheard him uttering this soliloquy in his strong, emphatick voice: &lsquo;Well, I have a mind to see what is done in other places of learning. I&rsquo;ll go and visit the Universities abroad. I&rsquo;ll go to France and Italy. I&rsquo;ll go to Padua. &mdash; And I&rsquo;ll mind my business. For an <span class="t8">Athenian</span> blockhead is the worst of all blockheads.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Dr. Adams told me that Johnson, while he was at Pembroke College, &lsquo;was caressed and loved by all about him, was a gay and frolicksome fellow, and passed there the happiest part of his life.&rsquo; But this is a striking proof of the fallacy of appearances, and how little any of us know of the real internal state even of those whom we see most frequently; for the truth is, that he was then depressed by poverty, and irritated by disease. When I mentioned to him this account as given me by Dr. Adams, he said, &lsquo;Ah, Sir, I was mad and violent. It was bitterness which they mistook for frolick. I was miserably poor, and I thought to fight my way by my literature and my wit; so I disregarded all power and all authority.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">The Bishop of Dromore observes in a letter to me,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The pleasure he took in vexing the tutors and fellows has been often mentioned. But I have heard him say, what ought to be recorded to the honour of the present venerable master of that College, the Reverend William Adams, D.D., who was then very young, and one of the junior fellows; that the mild but judicious expostulations of this worthy man, whose virtue awed him, and whose learning he revered, made him really ashamed of himself, &ldquo;though I fear (said he) I was too proud to own it.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I have heard from some of his cotemporaries that he was generally seen lounging at the College gate, with a circle of young students round him, whom he was entertaining with wit, and keeping from their studies, if not spiriting them up to rebellion against the College discipline, which in his maturer years he so much extolled.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He very early began to attempt keeping notes or memorandums, by way of a diary of his life. I find, in a parcel of loose leaves, the following spirited resolution to contend against his natural indolence:</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;<span class="t8">Oct. 1729. Desidiæ valedixi; syrenis istius cantibus surdam posthac aurem obversurus</span>. &mdash; I bid farewell to Sloth, being resolved henceforth not to listen to her syren strains.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I have also in my possession a few leaves of another <span class="t8">Libellus</span>, or little book, entitled ANNALES, in which some of the early particulars of his history are registered in Latin.</p>
<p class="p24">I do not find that he formed any close intimacies with his fellow-collegians. But Dr. Adams told me that he contracted a love and regard for Pembroke College, which he retained to the last. A short time before his death he sent to that College a present of all his works, to be deposited in their library; and he had thoughts of leaving to it his house at Lichfield; but his friends who were about him very properly dissuaded him from it, and he bequeathed it to some poor relations. He took a pleasure in boasting of the many eminent men who had been educated at Pembroke. In this list are found the names of Mr. Hawkins the Poetry Professor, Mr. Shenstone, Sir William Blackstone, and others; not forgetting the celebrated popular preacher, Mr. George Whitefield, of whom, though Dr. Johnson did not think very highly, it must be acknowledged that his eloquence was powerful, his views pious and charitable, his assiduity almost incredible; and, that since his death, the integrity of his character has been fully vindicated. Being himself a poet, Johnson was peculiarly happy in mentioning how many of the sons of Pembroke were poets; adding, with a smile of sportive triumph, &lsquo;Sir, we are a nest of singing birds.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He was not, however, blind to what he thought the defects of his own College; and I have, from the information of Dr. Taylor, a very strong instance of that rigid honesty which he ever inflexibly preserved. Taylor had obtained his father&rsquo;s consent to be entered of Pembroke, that he might be with his schoolfellow Johnson, with whom, though some years older than himself, he was very intimate. This would have been a great comfort to Johnson. But he fairly told Taylor that he could not, in conscience, suffer him to enter where he knew he could not have an able tutor. He then made inquiry all round the University, and having found that Mr. Bateman, of Christ Church, was the tutor of highest reputation, Taylor was entered of that College. Mr. Bateman&rsquo;s lectures were so excellent, that Johnson used to come and get them at second-hand from Taylor, till his poverty being so extreme that his shoes were worn out, and his feet appeared through them, he saw that this humiliating circumstance was perceived by the Christ Church men, and he came no more. He was too proud to accept of money, and somebody having set a pair of new shoes at his door, he threw them away with indignation. How must we feel when we read such an anecdote of Samuel Johnson!</p>
<p class="p24">His spirited refusal of an eleemosynary supply of shoes, arose, no doubt, from a proper pride. But, considering his ascetick disposition at times, as acknowledged by himself in his &lsquo;Meditations,&rsquo; and the exaggeration with which some have treated the peculiarities of his character, I should not wonder to hear it ascribed to a principle of superstitious mortification; as we are told by Tursellinus, in his Life of St. Ignatius Loyola, that this intrepid founder of the order of Jesuits, when he arrived at Goa, after having made a severe pilgrimage through the Eastern deserts persisted in wearing his miserable shattered shoes, and when new ones were offered him rejected them as an unsuitable indulgence.</p>
<p class="p24">The <span class="t8">res angusta domi</span> prevented him from having the advantage of a complete academical education. The friend to whom he had trusted for support had deceived him. His debts in College, though not great, were increasing; and his scanty remittances from Lichfield, which had all along been made with great difficulty, could be supplied no longer, his father having fallen into a state of insolvency. Compelled, therefore, by irresistible necessity, he left the College in autumn, 1731, without a degree, having been a member of it little more than three years.</p>
<p class="p24">Dr. Adams, the worthy and respectable master of Pembroke College, has generally had the reputation of being Johnson&rsquo;s tutor. The fact, however, is, that in 1731 Mr. Jorden quitted the College, and his pupils were transferred to Dr. Adams; so that had Johnson returned, Dr. Adams <span class="t8">would have been his tutor</span>. It is to be wished, that this connection had taken place. His equal temper, mild disposition, and politeness of manners, might have insensibly softened the harshness of Johnson, and infused into him those more delicate charities, those <span class="t8">petites morales</span>, in which, it must be confessed, our great moralist was more deficient than his best friends could fully justify. Dr. Adams paid Johnson this high compliment. He said to me at Oxford, in 1776, &lsquo;I was his nominal tutor; but he was above my mark.&rsquo; When I repeated it to Johnson, his eyes flashed with grateful satisfaction, and he exclaimed, &lsquo;That was liberal and noble.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">And now (I had almost said <span class="t8">poor</span>) Samuel Johnson returned to his native city, destitute, and not knowing how he should gain even a decent livelihood. His father&rsquo;s misfortunes in trade rendered him unable to support his son; and for some time there appeared no means by which he could maintain himself. In the December of this year his father died.</p>
<p class="p24">The state of poverty in which he died, appears from a note in one of Johnson&rsquo;s little diaries of the following year, which strongly displays his spirit and virtuous dignity of mind.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;1732, <span class="t8">Julii</span> 15. <span class="t8">Undecim aureos deposui, quo die quicquid ante matris funus (quod serum sit precor) de paternis bonis sperari licet, viginti scilicet libras, accepi. Usque adeo mihi fortuna fingenda est. Interea, ne paupertate vires animi languescant, nee in flagilia egestas abigat, cavendum</span>. &mdash; I layed by eleven guineas on this day, when I received twenty pounds, being all that I have reason to hope for out of my father&rsquo;s effects, previous to the death of my mother; an event which I pray GOD may be very remote. I now therefore see that I must make my own fortune. Meanwhile, let me take care that the powers of my mind may not be debilitated by poverty, and that indigence do not force me into any criminal act.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson was so far fortunate, that the respectable character of his parents, and his own merit, had, from his earliest years, secured him a kind reception in the best families at Lichfield. Among these I can mention Mr. Howard, Dr. Swinfen, Mr. Simpson, Mr. Levett, Captain Garrick, father of the great ornament of the British stage; but above all, Mr. Gilbert Walmsley, Register of the Prerogative Court of Lichfield, whose character, long after his decease, Dr. Johnson has, in his Life of Edmund Smith, thus drawn in the glowing colours of gratitude:</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Of Gilbert Walmsley, thus presented to my mind, let me indulge myself in the remembrance. I knew him very early; he was one of the first friends that literature procured me, and I hope that, at least, my gratitude made me worthy of his notice.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;He was of an advanced age, and I was only not a boy, yet he never received my notions with contempt. He was a whig, with all the virulence and malevolence of his party; yet difference of opinion did not keep us apart. I honoured him and he endured me.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;He had mingled with the gay world without exemption from its vices or its follies; but had never neglected the cultivation of his mind. His belief of revelation was unshaken; his learning preserved his principles; he grew first regular, and then pious.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;His studies had been so various, that I am not able to name a man of equal knowledge. His acquaintance with books was great, and what he did not immediately know, he could, at least, tell where to find. Such was his amplitude of learning, and such his copiousness of communication, that it may be doubted whether a day now passes, in which I have not some advantage from his friendship.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;At this man&rsquo;s table I enjoyed many cheerful and instructive hours, with companions, such as are not often found &mdash; with one who has lengthened, and one who has gladdened life; with Dr. James, whose skill in physick will be long remembered; and with David Garrick, whom I hoped to have gratified with this character of our common friend. But what are the hopes of man! I am disappointed by that stroke of death, which has eclipsed the gaiety of nations, and impoverished the publick stock of harmless pleasure.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">In these families he passed much time in his early years. In most of them, he was in the company of ladies, particularly at Mr. Walmsley&rsquo;s, whose wife and sisters-in-law, of the name of Aston, and daughters of a Baronet, were remarkable for good breeding; so that the notion which has been industriously circulated and believed, that he never was in good company till late in life, and, consequently had been confirmed in coarse and ferocious manners by long habits, is wholly without foundation. Some of the ladies have assured me, they recollected him well when a young man, as distinguished for his complaisance.</p>
<p class="p24">And that this politeness was not merely occasional and temporary, or confined to the circles of Lichfield, is ascertained by the testimony of a lady, who, in a paper with which I have been favoured by a daughter of his intimate friend and physician, Dr. Lawrence, thus describes Dr. Johnson some years afterwards:</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;As the particulars of the former part of Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s life do not seem to be very accurately known, a lady hopes that the following information may not be unacceptable.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;She remembers Dr. Johnson on a visit to Dr. Taylor, at Ashbourn, some time between the end of the year 37, and the middle of the year 40; she rather thinks it to have been after he and his wife were removed to London. During his stay at Ashbourn, he made frequent visits to Mr. Meynell, at Bradley, where his company was much desired by the ladies of the family, who were, perhaps, in point of elegance and accomplishments, inferiour to few of those with whom he was afterwards acquainted. Mr. Meynell&rsquo;s eldest daughter was afterwards married to Mr. Fitzherbert, father to Mr. Alleyne Fitzherbert, lately minister to the court of Russia. Of her, Dr. Johnson said, in Dr. Lawrence&rsquo;s study, that she had the best understanding he ever met with in any human being. At Mr. Meynell&rsquo;s he also commenced that friendship with Mrs. Hill Boothby, sister to the present Sir Brook Boothby, which continued till her death. <span class="t8">The young woman whom he used to call Molly Aston</span>, was sister to Sir Thomas Aston, and daughter to a Baronet; she was also sister to the wife of his friend Mr. Gilbert Walmsley. Besides his intimacy with the above-mentioned persons, who were surely people of rank and education, while he was yet at Lichfield he used to be frequently at the house of Dr. Swinfen, a gentleman of a very ancient family in Staffordshire, from which, after the death of his elder brother, he inherited a good estate. He was, besides, a physician of very extensive practice; but for want of due attention to the management of his domestick concerns, left a very large family in indigence. One of his daughters, Mrs. Desmoulins, afterwards found an asylum in the house of her old friend, whose doors were always open to the unfortunate, and who well observed the precept of the Gospel, for he &ldquo;was kind to the unthankful and to the evil.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">In the forlorn state of his circumstances, he accepted of an offer to be employed as usher in the school of Market-Bosworth, in Leicestershire, to which it appears, from one of his little fragments of a diary, that he went on foot, on the 16th of July.&mdash; &lsquo;<span class="t8">Julii 16. Bosvortiam pedes petii</span>.&rsquo; But it is not true, as has been erroneously related, that he was assistant to the famous Anthony Blackwall, whose merit has been honoured by the testimony of Bishop Hurd, who was his scholar; for Mr. Blackwall died on the 8th of April, 1730, more than a year before Johnson left the University.</p>
<p class="p24">This employment was very irksome to him in every respect, and he complained grievously of it in his letters to his friend Mr. Hector, who was now settled as a surgeon at Birmingham. The letters are lost; but Mr. Hector recollects his writing &lsquo;that the poet had described the dull sameness of his existence in these words, &ldquo;<span class="t8">Vitam continet una dies</span>&rdquo; (one day contains the whole of my life); that it was unvaried as the note of the cuckow; and that he did not know whether it was more disagreeable for him to teach, or the boys to learn, the grammar rules.&rsquo; His general aversion to this painful drudgery was greatly enhanced by a disagreement between him and Sir Wolstan Dixey, the patron of the school, in whose house, I have been told, he officiated as a kind of domestick chaplain, so far, at least, as to say grace at table, but was treated with what he represented as intolerable harshness; and, after suffering for a few months such complicated misery, he relinquished a situation which all his life afterwards he recollected with the strongest aversion, and even a degree of horrour. But it is probable that at this period, whatever uneasiness he may have endured, he laid the foundation of much future eminence by application to his studies.</p>
<p class="p24">Being now again totally unoccupied, he was invited by Mr. Hector to pass some time with him at Birmingham, as his guest, at the house of Mr. Warren, with whom Mr. Hector lodged and boarded. Mr. Warren was the first established bookseller in Birmingham, and was very attentive to Johnson, who he soon found could be of much service to him in his trade, by his knowledge of literature; and he even obtained the assistance of his pen in furnishing some numbers of a periodical Essay printed in the news-paper, of which Warren was proprietor. After very diligent inquiry, I have not been able to recover those early specimens of that particular mode of writing by which Johnson afterwards so greatly distinguished himself.</p>
<p class="p24">He continued to live as Mr. Hector&rsquo;s guest for about six months, and then hired lodgings in another part of the town, finding himself as well situated at Birmingham as he supposed he could be any where, while he had no settled plan of life, and very scanty means of subsistence. He made some valuable acquaintances there, amongst whom were Mr. Porter, a mercer, whose widow he afterwards married, and Mr. Taylor, who by his ingenuity in mechanical inventions, and his success in trade, acquired an immense fortune. But the comfort of being near Mr. Hector, his old school-fellow and intimate friend, was Johnson&rsquo;s chief inducement to continue here.</p>
<p class="p24">In what manner he employed his pen at this period, or whether he derived from it any pecuniary advantage, I have not been able to ascertain. He probably got a little money from Mr. Warren; and we are certain, that he executed here one piece of literary labour, of which Mr. Hector has favoured me with a minute account. Having mentioned that he had read at Pembroke College a Voyage to Abyssinia, by Lobo, a Portuguese Jesuit, and that he thought an abridgment and translation of it from the French into English might be an useful and profitable publication, Mr. Warren and Mr. Hector joined in urging him to undertake it. He accordingly agreed; and the book not being to be found in Birmingham, he borrowed it of Pembroke College. A part of the work being very soon done, one Osborn, who was Mr. Warren&rsquo;s printer, was set to work with what was ready, and Johnson engaged to supply the press with copy as it should be wanted; but his constitutional indolence soon prevailed, and the work was at a stand. Mr. Hector, who knew that a motive of humanity would be the most prevailing argument with his friend, went to Johnson, and represented to him, that the printer could have no other employment till this undertaking was finished, and that the poor man and his family were suffering. Johnson upon this exerted the powers of his mind, though his body was relaxed. He lay in bed with the book, which was a quarto, before him, and dictated while Hector wrote. Mr. Hector carried the sheets to the press, and corrected almost all the proof sheets, very few of which were even seen by Johnson. In this manner, with the aid of Mr. Hector&rsquo;s active friendship, the book was completed, and was published in 1735, with LONDON upon the title-page, though it was in reality printed at Birmingham, a device too common with provincial publishers. For this work he had from Mr. Warren only the sum of five guineas.</p>
<p class="p24">This being the first prose work of Johnson, it is a curious object of inquiry how much may be traced in it of that style which marks his subsequent writings with such peculiar excellence; with so happy an union of force, vivacity, and perspicuity. I have perused the book with this view, and have found that here, as I believe in every other translation, there is in the work itself no vestige of the translator&rsquo;s own style; for the language of translation being adapted to the thoughts of another person, insensibly follows their cast, and, as it were, runs into a mould that is ready prepared.</p>
<p class="p24">Thus, for instance, taking the first sentence that occurs at the opening of the book, p. 4.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I lived here above a year, and completed my studies in divinity; in which time some letters were received from the fathers of Ethiopia, with an account that Sultan Segned, Emperour of Abyssinia, was converted to the church of Rome; that many of his subjects had followed his example, and that there was a great want of missionaries to improve these prosperous beginnings. Every body was very desirous of seconding the zeal of our fathers, and of sending them the assistance they requested; to which we were the more encouraged, because the Emperour&rsquo;s letter informed our Provincial, that we might easily enter his dominions by the way of Dancala; but, unhappily, the secretary wrote Geila for Dancala, which cost two of our fathers their lives.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Every one acquainted with Johnson&rsquo;s manner will be sensible that there is nothing of it here; but that this sentence might have been composed by any other man.</p>
<p class="p24">But, in the Preface, the Johnsonian style begins to appear; and though use had not yet taught his wing a permanent and equable flight, there are parts of it which exhibit his best manner in full vigour. I had once the pleasure of examining it with Mr. Edmund Burke, who confirmed me in this opinion, by his superiour critical sagacity, and was, I remember, much delighted with the following specimen:</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The Portuguese traveller, contrary to the general vein of his countrymen, has amused his reader with no romantick absurdity, or incredible fictions; whatever he relates, whether true or not, is at least probable; and he who tells nothing exceeding the bounds of probability, has a right to demand that they should believe him who cannot contradict him.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;He appears, by his modest and unaffected narration, to have described things as he saw them, to have copied nature from the life, and to have consulted his senses, not his imagination. He meets with no basilisks that destroy with their eyes, his crocodiles devour their prey without tears, and his cataracts fall from the rocks without deafening the neighbouring inhabitants.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The reader will here find no regions cursed with irremediable barrenness, or blessed with spontaneous fecundity; no perpetual gloom, or unceasing sunshine; nor are the nations here described either devoid of all sense of humanity, or consummate in all private or social virtues. Here are no Hottentots without religious polity or articulate language; no Chinese perfectly polite, and completely skilled in all sciences; he will discover, what will always be discovered by a diligent and impartial enquirer, that wherever human nature is to be found, there is a mixture of vice and virtue, a contest of passion and reason; and that the Creator doth not appear partial in his distributions, but has balanced, in most countries, their particular inconveniencies by particular favours.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Here we have an early example of that brilliant and energetick expression, which, upon innumerable occasions in his subsequent life, justly impressed the world with the highest admiration.</p>
<p class="p24">Nor can any one, conversant with the writings of Johnson, fail to discern his hand in this passage of the Dedication to John Warren, Esq. of Pembrokeshire, though it is ascribed to Warren the bookseller:</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;A generous and elevated mind is distinguished by nothing more certainly than an eminent degree of curiosity; nor is that curiosity ever more agreeably or usefully employed, than in examining the laws and customs of foreign nations. I hope, therefore, the present I now presume to make, will not be thought improper; which, however, it is not my business as a dedicator to commend, nor as a bookseller to depreciate.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">It is reasonable to suppose, that his having been thus accidentally led to a particular study of the history and manners of Abyssinia, was the remote occasion of his writing, many years afterwards, his admirable philosophical tale, the principal scene of which is laid in that country.</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson returned to Lichfield early in 1734, and in August that year he made an attempt to procure some little subsistence by his pen; for he published proposals for printing by subscription the Latin Poems of Politian: &lsquo;<span class="t8">Angeli Politiani Poemata Latina, quibus, Notas cum historiâ Latinæ poeseos, à Petrarchæ ævo ad Politiani tempora deductâ, et vitâ Politiani fusius quam antehac enarratâ, addidit</span> SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">It appears that his brother Nathanael had taken up his father&rsquo;s trade; for it is mentioned that &lsquo;subscriptions are taken in by the Editor, or N. Johnson, bookseller, of Lichfield.&rsquo; Notwithstanding the merit of Johnson, and the cheap price at which this book was offered, there were not subscribers enough to insure a sufficient sale; so the work never appeared, and probably, never was executed.</p>
<p class="p24">We find him again this year at Birmingham, and there is preserved the following letter from him to Mr. Edward Cave, the original compiler and editor of the <span class="t8">Gentleman&rsquo;s Magazine</span>:</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">TO MR. CAVE.</span></p>
<p class="p21"><span class="t8">Nov</span>. 25, 1734.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;As you appear no less sensible than your readers of the defects of your poetical article, you will not be displeased, if, in order to the improvement of it, I communicate to you the sentiments of a person, who will undertake, on reasonable terms, sometimes to fill a column.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;His opinion is, that the publick would not give you a bad reception, if, beside the current wit of the month, which a critical examination would generally reduce to a narrow compass, you admitted not only poems, inscriptions, &amp;c. never printed before, which he will sometimes supply you with; but likewise short literary dissertations in Latin or English, critical remarks on authours ancient or modern, forgotten poems that deserve revival, or loose pieces, like Floyer&rsquo;s, worth preserving. By this method, your literary article, for so it might be called, will, he thinks, be better recommended to the publick than by low jests, awkward buffoonery, or the dull scurrilities of either party.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;If such a correspondence will be agreeable to you, be pleased to inform me in two posts, what the conditions are on which you shall expect it. Your late offer gives me no reason to distrust your generosity. If you engage in any literary projects besides this paper, I have other designs to impart, if I could be secure from having others reap the advantage of what I should hint.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your letter by being directed to <span class="t8">S. Smith</span>, to be left at the Castle in Birmingham, Warwickshire, will reach</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your humble servant.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Mr. Cave has put a note on this letter, &lsquo;Answered Dec. 2.&rsquo; But whether any thing was done in consequence of it we are not informed.</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson had, from his early youth, been sensible to the influence of female charms. When at Stourbridge school, he was much enamoured of Olivia Lloyd, a young quaker, to whom he wrote a copy of verses, which I have not been able to recover; but with what facility and elegance he could warble the amorous lay, will appear from the following lines which he wrote for his friend Mr. Edmund Hector.</p>
<p class="p24">VERSES <span class="t8">to a</span> LADY, <span class="t8">on receiving from her a</span> SPRIG of MYRTLE.</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;What hopes, what terrours does thy gift create,<br/>Ambiguous emblem of uncertain fate:<br/>The myrtle, ensign of supreme command,<br/>Consign&rsquo;d by Venus to Melissa&rsquo;s hand;<br/>Not less capricious than a reigning fair,<br/>Now grants, and now rejects a lover&rsquo;s prayer.<br/>In myrtle shades oft sings the happy swain,<br/>In myrtle shades despairing ghosts complain;<br/>The myrtle crowns the happy lovers&rsquo; heads,<br/>The unhappy lovers&rsquo; grave the myrtle spreads:<br/>O then the meaning of thy gift impart,<br/>And ease the throbbings of an anxious heart!<br/>Soon must this bough, as you shall fix his doom,<br/>Adorn Philander&rsquo;s head, or grace his tomb.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">His juvenile attachments to the fair sex were, however, very transient; and it is certain that he formed no criminal connection whatsoever. Mr. Hector, who lived with him in his younger days in the utmost intimacy and social freedom, has assured me, that even at that ardent season his conduct was strictly virtuous in that respect; and that though he loved to exhilarate himself with wine, he never knew him intoxicated but once.</p>
<p class="p24">In a man whom religious education has secured from licentious indulgences, the passion of love, when once it has seized him, is exceedingly strong; being unimpaired by dissipation, and totally concentrated in one object. This was experienced by Johnson, when he became the fervent admirer of Mrs. Porter, after her first husband&rsquo;s death. Miss Porter told me, that when he was first introduced to her mother, his appearance was very forbidding: he was then lean and lank, so that his immense structure of bones was hideously striking to the eye, and the scars of the scrophula were deeply visible. He also wore his hair, which was straight and stiff, and separated behind: and he often had, seemingly, convulsive starts and odd gesticulations, which tended to excite at once surprize and ridicule. Mrs. Porter was so much engaged by his conversation that she overlooked all these external disadvantages, and said to her daughter, &lsquo;this is the most sensible man that I ever saw in my life.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Though Mrs. Porter was double the age of Johnson, and her person and manner, as described to me by the late Mr. Garrick, were by no means pleasing to others, she must have had a superiority of understanding and talents, as she certainly inspired him with a more than ordinary passion; and she having signified her willingness to accept of his hand, he went to Lichfield to ask his mother&rsquo;s consent to the marriage, which he could not but be conscious was a very imprudent scheme, both on account of their disparity of years, and her want of fortune. But Mrs. Johnson knew too well the ardour of her son&rsquo;s temper, and was too tender a parent to oppose his inclinations.</p>
<p class="p24">I know not for what reason the marriage ceremony was not performed at Birmingham; but a resolution was taken that it should be at Derby, for which place the bride and bridegroom set out on horseback, I suppose in very good humour. But though Mr. Topham Beauclerk used archly to mention Johnson&rsquo;s having told him, with much gravity, &lsquo;Sir, it was a love marriage on both sides,&rsquo; I have had from my illustrious friend the following curious account of their journey to church upon the nuptial morn:</p>
<p class="p24">9th July:&mdash; &lsquo;Sir, she had read the old romances, and had got into her head the fantastical notion that a woman of spirit should use her lover like a dog. So, Sir, at first she told me that I rode too fast, and she could not keep up with me; and, when I rode a little slower, she passed me, and complained that I lagged behind. I was not to be made the slave of caprice; and I resolved to begin as I meant to end. I therefore pushed on briskly, till I was fairly out of her sight. The road lay between two hedges, so I was sure she could not miss it; and I contrived that she should soon come up with me. When she did, I observed her to be in tears.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">This, it must be allowed, was a singular beginning of connubial felicity; but there is no doubt that Johnson, though he thus shewed a manly firmness, proved a most affectionate and indulgent husband to the last moment of Mrs. Johnson&rsquo;s life: and in his <span class="t8">Prayers and Meditations</span>, we find very remarkable evidence that his regard and fondness for her never ceased, even after her death.</p>
<p class="p24">He now set up a private academy, for which purpose he hired a large house, well situated near his native city. In the <span class="t8">Gentleman&rsquo;s Magazine</span> for 1736, there is the following advertisement:</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;At Edial, near Lichfield, in Staffordshire, young gentlemen are boarded and taught the Latin and Greek languages, by SAMUEL JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">But the only pupils that were put under his care were the celebrated David Garrick and his brother George, and a Mr. Offely, a young gentleman of good fortune who died early. As yet, his name had nothing of that celebrity which afterwards commanded the highest attention and respect of mankind. Had such an advertisement appeared after the publication of his <span class="t8">London</span>, or his <span class="t8">Rambler</span>, or his <span class="t8">Dictionary</span>, how would it have burst upon the world! with what eagerness would the great and the wealthy have embraced an opportunity of putting their sons under the learned tuition of SAMUEL JOHNSON. The truth, however, is, that he was not so well qualified for being a teacher of elements, and a conductor in learning by regular gradations, as men of inferiour powers of mind. His own acquisitions had been made by fits and starts, by violent irruptions into the regions of knowledge; and it could not be expected that his impatience would be subdued, and his impetuosity restrained, so as to fit him for a quiet guide to novices. The art of communicating instruction, of whatever kind, is much to be valued; and I have ever thought that those who devote themselves to this employment, and do their duty with diligence and success, are entitled to very high respect from the community, as Johnson himself often maintained. Yet I am of opinion that the greatest abilities are not only not required for this office, but render a man less fit for it.</p>
<p class="p24">While we acknowledge the justness of Thomson&rsquo;s beautiful remark,</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;Delightful task! to rear the tender thought,<br/>And teach the young idea how to shoot!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">we must consider that this delight is perceptible only by &lsquo;a mind at ease,&rsquo; a mind at once calm and clear; but that a mind gloomy and impetuous like that of Johnson, cannot be fixed for any length of time in minute attention, and must be so frequently irritated by unavoidable slowness and errour in the advances of scholars, as to perform the duty, with little pleasure to the teacher, and no great advantage to the pupils. Good temper is a most essential requisite in a Preceptor. Horace paints the character as <span class="t8">bland</span>:</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;… <span class="t8">Ut pueris olim dant crustula blandi Doctores, elementa velint ut discere</span>.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson was not more satisfied with his situation as the master of an academy, than with that of the usher of a school; we need not wonder, therefore, that he did not keep his academy above a year and a half. From Mr. Garrick&rsquo;s account he did not appear to have been profoundly reverenced by his pupils. His oddities of manner, and uncouth gesticulations, could not but be the subject of merriment to them; and, in particular, the young rogues used to listen at the door of his bed-chamber, and peep through the key-hole, that they might turn into ridicule his tumultuous and awkward fondness for Mrs. Johnson, whom he used to name by the familiar appellation of <span class="t8">Tetty</span> or <span class="t8">Tetsey</span>, which, like <span class="t8">Betty</span> or <span class="t8">Betsey</span>, is provincially used as a contraction for <span class="t8">Elisabeth</span>, her Christian name, but which to us seems ludicrous, when applied to a woman of her age and appearance. Mr. Garrick described her to me as very fat, with a bosom of more than ordinary protuberance, with swelled cheeks of a florid red, produced by thick painting, and increased by the liberal use of cordials; flaring and fantastick in her dress, and affected both in her speech and her general behaviour. I have seen Garrick exhibit her, by his exquisite talent of mimickry, so as to excite the heartiest bursts of laughter; but he, probably, as is the case in all such representations, considerably aggravated the picture.</p>
<p class="p24">That Johnson well knew the most proper course to be pursued in the instruction of youth, is authentically ascertained by the following paper in his own hand-writing, given about this period to a relation, and now in the possession of Mr. John Nichols:</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;SCHEME <span class="t8">for the</span> CLASSES <span class="t8">of a</span> GRAMMAR SCHOOL.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;When the introduction, or formation of nouns and verbs, is perfectly mastered, let them learn:</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Corderius by Mr. Clarke, beginning at the same time to translate out of the introduction, that by this means they may learn the syntax. Then let them proceed to:</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Erasmus, with an English translation, by the same authour.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Class II. Learns Eutropius and Cornelius Nepos, or Justin, with the translation.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;N.B. The first class gets for their part every morning the rules which they have learned before, and in the afternoon learns the Latin rules of the nouns and verbs.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;They are examined in the rules which they have learned every Thursday and Saturday.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The second class does the same whilst they are in Eutropius; afterwards their part is in the irregular nouns and verbs, and in the rules for making and scanning verses. They are examined as the first.</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;Class III. Ovid&rsquo;s Metamorphoses in the morning, and Caesar&rsquo;s<br/>Commentaries in the afternoon.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Practise in the Latin rules till they are perfect in them; afterwards in Mr. Leeds&rsquo;s Greek Grammar. Examined as before.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Afterwards they proceed to Virgil, beginning at the same time to write themes and verses, and to learn Greek; from thence passing on to Horace, &amp;c. as shall seem most proper.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I know not well what books to direct you to, because you have not informed me what study you will apply yourself to. I believe it will be most for your advantage to apply yourself wholly to the languages, till you go to the University. The Greek authours I think it best for you to read are these:</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;Cebes.<br/>&lsquo;Ælian. }<br/>&lsquo;Lucian by Leeds. } Attick.<br/>&lsquo;Xenophon. }<br/>&lsquo;Homer. Ionick.<br/>&lsquo;Theocritus. Dorick.<br/>&lsquo;Euripides. Attick and Dorick.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Thus you will be tolerably skilled in all the dialects, beginning with the Attick, to which the rest must be referred.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;In the study of Latin, it is proper not to read the latter authours, till you are well versed in those of the purest ages; as Terence, Tully, Cæsar, Sallust, Nepos, Velleius Paterculus, Virgil, Horace, Phædrus.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The greatest and most necessary task still remains, to attain a habit of expression, without which knowledge is of little use. This is necessary in Latin, and more necessary in English; and can only be acquired by a daily imitation of the best and correctest authours.</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">While Johnson kept his academy, there can be no doubt that he was insensibly furnishing his mind with various knowledge; but I have not discovered that he wrote any thing except a great part of his tragedy of <span class="t8">Irene</span>. Mr. Peter Garrick, the elder brother of David, told me that he remembered Johnson&rsquo;s borrowing the <span class="t8">Turkish History</span> of him, in order to form his play from it. When he had finished some part of it, he read what he had done to Mr. Walmsley, who objected to his having already brought his heroine into great distress, and asked him, &lsquo;how can you possibly contrive to plunge her into deeper calamity?&rsquo; Johnson, in sly allusion to the supposed oppressive proceedings of the court of which Mr. Walmsley was register, replied, &lsquo;Sir, I can put her into the Spiritual Court!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Mr. Walmsley, however, was well pleased with this proof of Johnson&rsquo;s abilities as a dramatick writer, and advised him to finish the tragedy, and produce it on the stage.</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson now thought of trying his fortune in London, the great field of genius and exertion, where talents of every kind have the fullest scope, and the highest encouragement. It is a memorable circumstance that his pupil David Garrick went thither at the same time, with intention to complete his education, and follow the profession of the law, from which he was soon diverted by his decided preference for the stage.</p>
<p class="p26">This joint expedition of those two eminent men to the metropolis, was<br/>many years afterwards noticed in an allegorical poem on Shakspeare&rsquo;s<br/>Mulberry Tree, by Mr. Lovibond, the ingenious authour of <span class="t8">The Tears of<br/>Old-May-day</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">They were recommended to Mr. Colson, an eminent mathematician and master of an academy, by the following letter from Mr. Walmsley:</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To THE REVEREND MR. COLSON.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Lichfield, March 2, 1737.</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I had the favour of yours, and am extremely obliged to you; but I cannot say I had a greater affection for you upon it than I had before, being long since so much endeared to you, as well by an early friendship, as by your many excellent and valuable qualifications; and, had I a son of my own, it would be my ambition, instead of sending him to the University, to dispose of him as this young gentleman is.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;He, and another neighbour of mine, one Mr. Samuel Johnson, set out this morning for London together. Davy Garrick is to be with you early the next week, and Mr. Johnson to try his fate with a tragedy, and to see to get himself employed in some translation, either from the Latin or the French. Johnson is a very good scholar and poet, and I have great hopes will turn out a fine tragedy-writer. If it should any way lie in your way, doubt not but you would be ready to recommend and assist your countryman.</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">&lsquo;G. WALMSLEY.&rsquo;</span></p>
<p class="p21">How he employed himself upon his first coming to London is not particularly known. I never heard that he found any protection or encouragement by the means of Mr. Colson, to whose academy David Garrick went. Mrs. Lucy Porter told me, that Mr. Walmsley gave him a letter of introduction to Lintot his bookseller, and that Johnson wrote some things for him; but I imagine this to be a mistake, for I have discovered no trace of it, and I am pretty sure he told me that Mr. Cave was the first publisher by whom his pen was engaged in London.</p>
<p class="p24">He had a little money when he came to town, and he knew how he could live in the cheapest manner. His first lodgings were at the house of Mr. Norris, a staymaker, in Exeter-street, adjoining Catharine-street, in the Strand. &lsquo;I dined (said he) very well for eight-pence, with very good company, at the Pine Apple in New-street, just by. Several of them had travelled. They expected to meet every day; but did not know one another&rsquo;s names. It used to cost the rest a shilling, for they drank wine; but I had a cut of meat for six-pence, and bread for a penny, and gave the waiter a penny; so that I was quite well served, nay, better than the rest, for they gave the waiter nothing.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He at this time, I believe, abstained entirely from fermented liquors: a practice to which he rigidly conformed for many years together, at different periods of his life.</p>
<p class="p24">His Ofellus in the <span class="t8">Art of Living in London</span>, I have heard him relate, was an Irish painter, whom he knew at Birmingham, and who had practised his own precepts of oeconomy for several years in the British capital. He assured Johnson, who, I suppose, was then meditating to try his fortune in London, but was apprehensive of the expence, &lsquo;that thirty pounds a year was enough to enable a man to live there without being contemptible. He allowed ten pounds for clothes and linen. He said a man might live in a garret at eighteen-pence a week; few people would inquire where he lodged; and if they did, it was easy to say, &lsquo;Sir, I am to be found at such a place.&rsquo; By spending three-pence in a coffee-house, he might be for some hours every day in very good company; he might dine for six-pence, breakfast on bread and milk for a penny, and do without supper. On <span class="t8">clean-shirt-day</span> he went abroad, and paid visits.&rsquo; I have heard him more than once talk of this frugal friend, whom he recollected with esteem and kindness, and did not like to have one smile at the recital. &lsquo;This man (said he, gravely) was a very sensible man, who perfectly understood common affairs: a man of a great deal of knowledge of the world, fresh from life, not strained through books. He borrowed a horse and ten pounds at Birmingham. Finding himself master of so much money, he set off for West Chester, in order to get to Ireland. He returned the horse, and probably the ten pounds too, after he got home.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Considering Johnson&rsquo;s narrow circumstances in the early part of his life, and particularly at the interesting aera of his launching into the ocean of London, it is not to be wondered at, that an actual instance, proved by experience of the possibility of enjoying the intellectual luxury of social life, upon a very small income, should deeply engage his attention, and be ever recollected by him as a circumstance of much importance. He amused himself, I remember, by computing how much more expence was absolutely necessary to live upon the same scale with that which his friend described, when the value of money was diminished by the progress of commerce. It maybe estimated that double the money might now with difficulty be sufficient.</p>
<p class="p24">Amidst this cold obscurity, there was one brilliant circumstance to cheer him; he was well acquainted with Mr. Henry Hervey, one of the branches of the noble family of that name, who had been quartered at Lichfield as an officer of the army, and had at this time a house in London, where Johnson was frequently entertained, and had an opportunity of meeting genteel company. Not very long before his death, he mentioned this, among other particulars of his life, which he was kindly communicating to me; and he described this early friend, &lsquo;Harry Hervey,&rsquo; thus: &lsquo;He was a vicious man, but very kind to me. If you call a dog HERVEY, I shall love him.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He told me he had now written only three acts of his <span class="t8">Irene</span>, and that he retired for some time to lodgings at Greenwich, where he proceeded in it somewhat further, and used to compose, walking in the Park; but did not stay long enough at that place to finish it.</p>
<p class="p24">At this period we find the following letter from him to Mr. Edward Cave, which, as a link in the chain of his literary history, it is proper to insert:</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To MR. CAVE.</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;Greenwich, next door to the Golden Heart,<br/>&lsquo;Church-street, July 12, 1737.</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Having observed in your papers very uncommon offers of encouragement to men of letters, I have chosen, being a stranger in London, to communicate to you the following design, which, I hope, if you join in it, will be of advantage to both of us.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The History of the Council of Trent having been lately translated into French, and published with large Notes by Dr. Le Courayer, the reputation of that book is so much revived in England, that, it is presumed, a new translation of it from the Italian, together with Le Courayer&rsquo;s Notes from the French, could not fail of a favourable reception.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;If it be answered, that the History is already in English, it must be remembered, that there was the same objection against Le Courayer&rsquo;s undertaking, with this disadvantage, that the French had a version by one of their best translators, whereas you cannot read three pages of the English History without discovering that the style is capable of great improvements; but whether those improvements are to be expected from the attempt, you must judge from the specimen, which, if you approve the proposal, I shall submit to your examination.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Suppose the merit of the versions equal, we may hope that the addition of the Notes will turn the balance in our favour, considering the reputation of the Annotator.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Be pleased to favour me with a speedy answer, if you are not willing to engage in this scheme; and appoint me a day to wait upon you, if you are.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am, Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your humble servant,</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">It should seem from this letter, though subscribed with his own name, that he had not yet been introduced to Mr. Cave. We shall presently see what was done in consequence of the proposal which it contains.</p>
<p class="p24">In the course of the summer he returned to Lichfield, where he had left Mrs. Johnson, and there he at last finished his tragedy, which was not executed with his rapidity of composition upon other occasions, but was slowly and painfully elaborated. A few days before his death, while burning a great mass of papers, he picked out from among them the original unformed sketch of this tragedy, in his own hand-writing, and gave it to Mr. Langton, by whose favour a copy of it is now in my possession. It contains fragments of the intended plot, and speeches for the different persons of the drama, partly in the raw materials of prose, partly worked up into verse; as also a variety of hints for illustration, borrowed from the Greek, Roman, and modern writers. The hand-writing is very difficult to be read, even by those who were best acquainted with Johnson&rsquo;s mode of penmanship, which at all times was very particular. The King having graciously accepted of this manuscript as a literary curiosity, Mr. Langton made a fair and distinct copy of it, which he ordered to be bound up with the original and the printed tragedy; and the volume is deposited in the King&rsquo;s library. His Majesty was pleased to permit Mr. Langton to take a copy of it for himself.</p>
<p class="p24">The whole of it is rich in thought and imagery, and happy expressions; and of the <span class="t8">disjecta membra</span> scattered throughout, and as yet unarranged, a good dramatick poet might avail himself with considerable advantage. I shall give my readers some specimens of different kinds, distinguishing them by the Italick character.</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;Nor think to say, here will I stop,<br/>Here will I fix the limits of transgression,<br/>Nor farther tempt the avenging rage of heaven.<br/>When guilt like this once harbours in the breast,<br/>Those holy beings, whose unseen direction<br/>Guides through the maze of life the steps of man,<br/>Fly the detested mansions of impiety,<br/>And quit their charge to horrour and to ruin.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">A small part only of this interesting admonition is preserved in the play, and is varied, I think, not to advantage:</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;The soul once tainted with so foul a crime,<br/>No more shall glow with friendship&rsquo;s hallow&rsquo;d ardour,<br/>Those holy beings whose superior care<br/>Guides erring mortals to the paths of virtue,<br/>Affrighted at impiety like thine,<br/>Resign their charge to baseness and to ruin.&rsquo;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rsquo;I feel the soft infection<br/>Flush in my cheek, and wander in my veins.<br/>Teach me the Grecian arts of soft persuasion.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Sure this is love, which heretofore I conceived the dream of idle maids, and wanton poets.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Though no comets or prodigies foretold the ruin of Greece, signs which heaven must by another miracle enable us to understand, yet might it be foreshewn, by tokens no less certain, by the vices which always bring it on.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">This last passage is worked up in the tragedy itself, as follows:</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">LEONTIUS.</span></p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo; &mdash;&mdash; That power that kindly spreads<br/>The clouds, a signal of impending showers,<br/>To warn the wand&rsquo;ring linnet to the shade,<br/>Beheld, without concern, expiring Greece,<br/>And not one prodigy foretold our fate.</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">DEMETRIUS.</span></p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;A thousand horrid prodigies foretold it;<br/>A feeble government, eluded laws,<br/>A factious populace, luxurious nobles,<br/>And all the maladies of sinking States.<br/>When publick villainy, too strong for justice,<br/>Shows his bold front, the harbinger of ruin,<br/>Can brave Leontius call for airy wonders,<br/>Which cheats interpret, and which fools regard?<br/>When some neglected fabrick nods beneath<br/>The weight of years, and totters to the tempest,<br/>Must heaven despatch the messengers of light,<br/>Or wake the dead, to warn us of its fall?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">MAHOMET (to IRENE). &lsquo;I have tried thee, and joy to find that thou deservest to be loved by Mahomet, &mdash; with a mind great as his own. Sure, thou art an errour of nature, and an exception to the rest of thy sex, and art immortal; for sentiments like thine were never to sink into nothing. I thought all the thoughts of the fair had been to select the graces of the day, dispose the colours of the flaunting (flowing) robe, tune the voice and roll the eye, place the gem, choose the dress, and add new roses to the fading cheek, but &mdash; sparkling.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Thus in the tragedy:</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;Illustrious maid, new wonders fix me thine;<br/>Thy soul completes the triumphs of thy face:<br/>I thought, forgive my fair, the noblest aim,<br/>The strongest effort of a female soul<br/>Was but to choose the graces of the day,<br/>To tune the tongue, to teach the eyes to roll,<br/>Dispose the colours of the flowing robe,<br/>And add new roses to the faded cheek.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I shall select one other passage, on account of the doctrine which it illustrates. IRENE observes,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;That the Supreme Being will accept of virtue, whatever outward circumstances it may be accompanied with, and may be delighted with varieties of worship: <span class="t8">but is answered</span>, that variety cannot affect that Being, who, infinitely happy in his own perfections, wants no external gratifications; nor can infinite truth be delighted with falsehood; that though he may guide or pity those he leaves in darkness, he abandons those who shut their eyes against the beams of day.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson&rsquo;s residence at Lichfield, on his return to it at this time, was only for three months; and as he had as yet seen but a small part of the wonders of the Metropolis, he had little to tell his townsmen. He related to me the following minute anecdote of this period: &lsquo;In the last age, when my mother lived in London, there were two sets of people, those who gave the wall, and those who took it; the peaceable and the quarrelsome. When I returned to Lichfield, after having been in London, my mother asked me, whether I was one of those who gave the wall, or those who took it. <span class="t8">Now</span> it is fixed that every man keeps to the right; or, if one is taking the wall, another yields it; and it is never a dispute.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He now removed to London with Mrs. Johnson; but her daughter, who had lived with them at Edial, was left with her relations in the country. His lodgings were for some time in Woodstock-street, near Hanover-square, and afterwards in Castle-street, near Cavendish-square. As there is something pleasingly interesting, to many, in tracing so great a man through all his different habitations, I shall, before this work is concluded, present my readers with an exact list of his lodgings and houses, in order of time, which, in placid condescension to my respectful curiosity, he one evening dictated to me, but without specifying how long he lived at each. In the progress of his life I shall have occasion to mention some of them as connected with particular incidents, or with the writing of particular parts of his works. To some, this minute attention may appear trifling; but when we consider the punctilious exactness with which the different houses in which Milton resided have been traced by the writers of his life, a similar enthusiasm may be pardoned in the biographer of Johnson.</p>
<p class="p24">His tragedy being by this time, as he thought, completely finished and fit for the stage, he was very desirous that it should be brought forward. Mr. Peter Garrick told me, that Johnson and he went together to the Fountain tavern, and read it over, and that he afterwards solicited Mr. Fleetwood, the patentee of Drury-lane theatre, to have it acted at his house; but Mr. Fleetwood would not accept it, probably because it was not patronized by some man of high rank; and it was not acted till 1749, when his friend David Garrick was manager of that theatre.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">The Gentleman&rsquo;s Magazine</span>, begun and carried on by Mr. Edward Cave, under the name of SYLVANUS URBAN, had attracted the notice and esteem of Johnson, in an eminent degree, before he came to London as an adventurer in literature. He told me, that when he first saw St. John&rsquo;s Gate, the place where that deservedly popular miscellany was originally printed, he &lsquo;beheld it with reverence.&rsquo; I suppose, indeed, that every young authour has had the same kind of feeling for the magazine or periodical publication which has first entertained him, and in which he has first had an opportunity to see himself in print, without the risk of exposing his name. I myself recollect such impressions from &lsquo;<span class="t8">The Scots Magazine</span>,&rsquo; which was begun at Edinburgh in the year 1739, and has been ever conducted with judgement, accuracy, and propriety. I yet cannot help thinking of it with an affectionate regard. Johnson has dignified the <span class="t8">Gentleman&rsquo;s Magazine</span>, by the importance with which he invests the life of Cave; but he has given it still greater lustre by the various admirable Essays which he wrote for it.</p>
<p class="p24">Though Johnson was often solicited by his friends to make a complete list of his writings, and talked of doing it, I believe with a serious intention that they should all be collected on his own account, he put it off from year to year, and at last died without having done it perfectly. I have one in his own handwriting, which contains a certain number; I indeed doubt if he could have remembered every one of them, as they were so numerous, so various, and scattered in such a multiplicity of unconnected publications; nay, several of them published under the names of other persons, to whom he liberally contributed from the abundance of his mind. We must, therefore, be content to discover them, partly from occasional information given by him to his friends, and partly from internal evidence.</p>
<p class="p24">His first performance in the <span class="t8">Gentleman&rsquo;s Magazine</span>, which for many years was his principal source for employment and support, was a copy of Latin verses, in March 1738, addressed to the editor in so happy a style of compliment, that Cave must have been destitute both of taste and sensibility had he not felt himself highly gratified.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;<span class="t8">Ad</span> URBANUM&rsquo;.</p>
<p class="p26">URBANE, <span class="t8">nullis fesse laboribus</span>,<br/>URBANE, <span class="t8">nullis victe calumniis</span>,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Cui fronte sertum in eruditâ<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perpetuò viret et virebit;</p>

<p class="p10"><span class="t4">S.J.</span></p>
<p class="p21">It appears that he was now enlisted by Mr. Cave as a regular coadjutor in his magazine, by which he probably obtained a tolerable livelihood. At what time, or by what means, he had acquired a competent knowledge both of French and Italian, I do not know; but he was so well skilled in them, as to be sufficiently qualified for a translator. That part of his labour which consisted in emendation and improvement of the productions of other contributors, like that employed in levelling ground, can be perceived only by those who had an opportunity of comparing the original with the altered copy. What we certainly know to have been done by him in this way, was the Debates in both houses of Parliament, under the name of &lsquo;The Senate of Lilliput,&rsquo; sometimes with feigned denominations of the several speakers, sometimes with denominations formed of the letters of their real names, in the manner of what is called anagram, so that they might easily be decyphered. Parliament then kept the press in a kind of mysterious awe, which made it necessary to have recourse to such devices. In our time it has acquired an unrestrained freedom, so that the people in all parts of the kingdom have a fair, open, and exact report of the actual proceedings of their representatives and legislators, which in our constitution is highly to be valued; though, unquestionably, there has of late been too much reason to complain of the petulance with which obscure scribblers have presumed to treat men of the most respectable character and situation.</p>
<p class="p24">This important article of the <span class="t8">Gentleman&rsquo;s Magazine</span> was, for several years, executed by Mr. William Guthrie, a man who deserves to be respectably recorded in the literary annals of this country. He was descended of an ancient family in Scotland; but having a small patrimony, and being an adherent of the unfortunate house of Stuart, he could not accept of any office in the state; he therefore came to London, and employed his talents and learning as an &lsquo;Authour by profession.&rsquo; His writings in history, criticism, and politicks, had considerable merit. He was the first English historian who had recourse to that authentick source of information, the Parliamentary Journals; and such was the power of his political pen, that, at an early period, Government thought it worth their while to keep it quiet by a pension, which he enjoyed till his death. Johnson esteemed him enough to wish that his life should be written. The debates in Parliament, which were brought home and digested by Guthrie, whose memory, though surpassed by others who have since followed him in the same department, was yet very quick and tenacious, were sent by Cave to Johnson for his revision; and, after some time, when Guthrie had attained to greater variety of employment, and the speeches were more and more enriched by the accession of Johnson&rsquo;s genius, it was resolved that he should do the whole himself, from the scanty notes furnished by persons employed to attend in both houses of Parliament. Sometimes, however, as he himself told me, he had nothing more communicated to him than the names of the several speakers, and the part which they had taken in the debate.</p>
<p class="p24">Thus was Johnson employed during some of the best years of his life, as a mere literary labourer &lsquo;for gain, not glory,&rsquo; solely to obtain an honest support. He however indulged himself in occasional little sallies, which the French so happily express by the term <span class="t8">jeux d&rsquo;esprit</span>, and which will be noticed in their order, in the progress of this work.</p>
<p class="p24">But what first displayed his transcendent powers, and &lsquo;gave the world assurance of the MAN,&rsquo; was his <span class="t8">London, a Poem, in Imitation of the Third Satire of Juvenal</span>: which came out in May this year, and burst forth with a splendour, the rays of which will for ever encircle his name. Boileau had imitated the same satire with great success, applying it to Paris; but an attentive comparison will satisfy every reader, that he is much excelled by the English Juvenal. Oldham had also imitated it, and applied it to London; all which performances concur to prove, that great cities, in every age, and in every country, will furnish similar topicks of satire. Whether Johnson had previously read Oldham&rsquo;s imitation, I do not know; but it is not a little remarkable, that there is scarcely any coincidence found between the two performances, though upon the very same subject. The only instances are, in describing London as the <span class="t8">sink</span> of foreign worthlessness:</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo; &mdash;&mdash; the <span class="t8">common shore</span>, Where France does all her filth and ordure pour.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">OLDHAM.</span></p>
<p class="p21">&lsquo;The <span class="t8">common shore</span> of Paris and of Rome.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">JOHNSON.</span></p>
<p class="p21">and,</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;No calling or profession comes amiss,<br/>A <span class="t8">needy monsieur</span> can be what he please.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">OLDHAM.</span></p>
<p class="p21">&lsquo;All sciences a <span class="t8">fasting monsieur</span> knows.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">JOHNSON.</span></p>
<p class="p21">The particulars which Oldham has collected, both as exhibiting the horrours of London, and of the times, contrasted with better days, are different from those of Johnson, and in general well chosen, and well exprest.</p>
<p class="p24">There are, in Oldham&rsquo;s imitation, many prosaick verses and bad rhymes, and his poem sets out with a strange inadvertent blunder:</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;Tho&rsquo; much concern&rsquo;d to <span class="t8">leave</span> my dear old friend,<br/>I must, however, <span class="t8">his</span> design commend<br/>Of fixing in the country &mdash; .&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">It is plain he was not going to leave his <span class="t8">friend</span>; his friend was going to leave <span class="t8">him</span>. A young lady at once corrected this with good critical sagacity, to</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Tho&rsquo; much concern&rsquo;d to <span class="t8">lose</span> my dear old friend.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">There is one passage in the original, better transfused by Oldham than by Johnson:</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;Nil habet infelix paupertas durius in se,<br/>Quàm quod ridiculos homines facit;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">which is an exquisite remark on the galling meanness and contempt annexed to poverty: JOHNSON&rsquo;S imitation is,</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;Of all the griefs that harass the distrest,<br/>Sure the most bitter is a scornful jest.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">OLDHAM&rsquo;S, though less elegant, is more just:</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;Nothing in poverty so ill is borne,<br/>As its exposing men to grinning scorn.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Where, or in what manner this poem was composed, I am sorry that I neglected to ascertain with precision, from Johnson&rsquo;s own authority. He has marked upon his corrected copy of the first edition of it, &lsquo;Written in 1738;&rsquo; and, as it was published in the month of May in that year, it is evident that much time was not employed in preparing it for the press. The history of its publication I am enabled to give in a very satisfactory manner; and judging from myself, and many of my friends, I trust that it will not be uninteresting to my readers.</p>
<p class="p24">We may be certain, though it is not expressly named in the following letters to Mr. Cave, in 1738, that they all relate to it:</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To MR. CAVE.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Castle-street, Wednesday Morning. [<span class="t8">No date</span>. 1738.]</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;When I took the liberty of writing to you a few days ago, I did not expect a repetition of the same pleasure so soon; for a pleasure I shall always think it, to converse in any manner with an ingenious and candid man; but having the inclosed poem in my hands to dispose of for the benefit of the authour, (of whose abilities I shall say nothing, since I send you his performance,) I believed I could not procure more advantageous terms from any person than from you, who have so much distinguished yourself by your generous encouragement of poetry; and whose judgment of that art nothing but your commendation of my trifle can give me any occasion to call in question. I do not doubt but you will look over this poem with another eye, and reward it in a different manner, from a mercenary bookseller, who counts the lines he is to purchase, and considers nothing but the bulk. I cannot help taking notice, that, besides what the authour may hope for on account of his abilities, he has likewise another claim to your regard, as he lies at present under very disadvantageous circumstances of fortune. I beg, therefore, that you will favour me with a letter to-morrow, that I may know what you can afford to allow him, that he may either part with it to you, or find out, (which I do not expect,) some other way more to his satisfaction.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I have only to add, that as I am sensible I have transcribed it very coarsely, which, after having altered it, I was obliged to do, I will, if you please to transmit the sheets from the press, correct it for you; and take the trouble of altering any stroke of satire which you may dislike.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;By exerting on this occasion your usual generosity, you will not only encourage learning, and relieve distress, but (though it be in comparison of the other motives of very small account) oblige in a very sensible manner, Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your very humble servant,</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p26">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rsquo;To MR. CAVE.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rsquo;Monday, No. 6, Castle-street.</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">SIR,</span></p>
<p class="p21">&lsquo;I am to return you thanks for the present you were so kind as to send by me, and to intreat that you will be pleased to inform me by the penny-post, whether you resolve to print the poem. If you please to send it me by the post, with a note to Dodsley, I will go and read the lines to him, that we may have his consent to put his name in the title-page. As to the printing, if it can be set immediately about, I will be so much the authour&rsquo;s friend, as not to content myself with mere solicitations in his favour. I propose, if my calculation be near the truth, to engage for the reimbursement of all that you shall lose by an impression of 500; provided, as you very generously propose, that the profit, if any, be set aside for the authour&rsquo;s use, excepting the present you made, which, if he be a gainer, it is fit he should repay. I beg that you will let one of your servants write an exact account of the expense of such an impression, and send it with the poem, that I may know what I engage for. I am very sensible, from your generosity on this occasion, of your regard to learning, even in its unhappiest state; and cannot but think such a temper deserving of the gratitude of those who suffer so often from a contrary disposition. I am, Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your most humble servant,</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To MR. CAVE.</p>
<p class="p24">[No date.]</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I waited on you to take the copy to Dodsley&rsquo;s: as I remember the number of lines which it contains, it will be no longer than <span class="t8">Eugenio</span>, with the quotations, which must be subjoined at the bottom of the page; part of the beauty of the performance (if any beauty be allowed it) consisting in adapting Juvenal&rsquo;s sentiments to modern facts and persons. It will, with those additions, very conveniently make five sheets. And since the expense will be no more, I shall contentedly insure it, as I mentioned in my last. If it be not therefore gone to Dodsley&rsquo;s, I beg it may be sent me by the penny-post, that I may have it in the evening. I have composed a Greek epigram to Eliza, and think she ought to be celebrated in as many different languages as Lewis le Grand. Pray send me word when you will begin upon the poem, for it is a long way to walk. I would leave my Epigram, but have not daylight to transcribe it. I am, Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your&rsquo;s, &amp;c.,</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">&lsquo;TO MR. CAVE.</span></p>
<p class="p21">[No date.]</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am extremely obliged by your kind letter, and will not fail to attend you to-morrow with <span class="t8">Irene</span>, who looks upon you as one of her best friends.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I was to day with Mr. Dodsley, who declares very warmly in favour of the paper you sent him, which he desires to have a share in, it being, as he says, <span class="t8">a creditable thing to be concerned in</span>. I knew not what answer to make till I had consulted you, nor what to demand on the authour&rsquo;s part, but am very willing that, if you please, he should have a part in it, as he will undoubtedly be more diligent to disperse and promote it. If you can send me word to-morrow what I shall say to him, I will settle matters, and bring the poem with me for the press, which, as the town empties, we cannot be too quick with. I am, Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your&rsquo;s, &amp;c.,</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">To us who have long known the manly force, bold spirit, and masterly versification of this poem, it is a matter of curiosity to observe the diffidence with which its authour brought it forward into publick notice, while he is so cautious as not to avow it to be his own production; and with what humility he offers to allow the printer to &lsquo;alter any stroke of satire which he might dislike.&rsquo; That any such alteration was made, we do not know. If we did, we could not but feel an indignant regret; but how painful is it to see that a writer of such vigorous powers of mind was actually in such distress, that the small profit which so short a poem, however excellent, could yield, was courted as a &lsquo;relief.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">It has been generally said, I know not with what truth, that Johnson offered his <span class="t8">London</span> to several booksellers, none of whom would purchase it. To this circumstance Mr. Derrick alludes in the following lines of his <span class="t8">Fortune, a Rhapsody</span>:</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;Will no kind patron JOHNSON own?<br/>Shall JOHNSON friendless range the town?<br/>And every publisher refuse<br/>The offspring of his happy Muse?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">But we have seen that the worthy, modest, and ingenious Mr. Robert Dodsley had taste enough to perceive its uncommon merit, and thought it creditable to have a share in it. The fact is, that, at a future conference, he bargained for the whole property of it, for which he gave Johnson ten guineas; who told me, &lsquo;I might, perhaps, have accepted of less; but that Paul Whitehead had a little before got ten guineas for a poem and I would not take less than Paul Whitehead.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I may here observe, that Johnson appeared to me to undervalue Paul Whitehead upon every occasion when he was mentioned, and, in my opinion, did not do him justice; but when it is considered that Paul Whitehead was a member of a riotous and profane club, we may account for Johnson&rsquo;s having a prejudice against him. Paul Whitehead was, indeed, unfortunate in being not only slighted by Johnson, but violently attacked by Churchill, who utters the following imprecation:</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;May I (can worse disgrace on manhood fall?)<br/>Be born a Whitehead, and baptiz&rsquo;d a Paul!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">yet I shall never be persuaded to think meanly of the authour of so brilliant and pointed a satire as <span class="t8">Manners</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson&rsquo;s <span class="t8">London</span> was published in May, 1738; and it is remarkable, that it came out on the same morning with Pope&rsquo;s satire, entitled &lsquo;1738;&rsquo; so that England had at once its Juvenal and Horace as poetical monitors. The Reverend Dr. Douglas, now Bishop of Salisbury, to whom I am indebted for some obliging communications, was then a student at Oxford, and remembers well the effect which <span class="t8">London</span> produced. Every body was delighted with it; and there being no name to it, the first buz of the literary circles was &lsquo;here is an unknown poet, greater even than Pope.&rsquo; And it is recorded in the <span class="t8">Gentleman s Magazine</span> of that year, that it &lsquo;got to the second edition in the course of a week.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">One of the warmest patrons of this poem on its first appearance was General Oglethorpe, whose &lsquo;strong benevolence of soul,&rsquo; was unabated during the course of a very long life; though it is painful to think, that he had but too much reason to become cold and callous, and discontented with the world, from the neglect which he experienced of his publick and private worth, by those in whose power it was to gratify so gallant a veteran with marks of distinction. This extraordinary person was as remarkable for his learning and taste, as for his other eminent qualities; and no man was more prompt, active, and generous, in encouraging merit. I have heard Johnson gratefully acknowledge, in his presence, the kind and effectual support which he gave to his <span class="t8">London</span>, though unacquainted with its authour.</p>
<p class="p24">Pope, who then filled the poetical throne without a rival, it may reasonably be presumed, must have been particularly struck by the sudden appearance of such a poet; and, to his credit, let it be remembered, that his feelings and conduct on the occasion were candid and liberal. He requested Mr. Richardson, son of the painter, to endeavour to find out who this new authour was. Mr. Richardson, after some inquiry, having informed him that he had discovered only that his name was Johnson, and that he was some obscure man, Pope said, &lsquo;he will soon be <span class="t8">déterré</span>.&rsquo; We shall presently see, from a note written by Pope, that he was himself afterwards more successful in his inquiries than his friend.</p>
<p class="p24">That in this justly-celebrated poem may be found a few rhymes which the critical precision of English prosody at this day would disallow, cannot be denied; but with this small imperfection, which in the general blaze of its excellence is not perceived, till the mind has subsided into cool attention, it is, undoubtedly, one of the noblest productions in our language, both for sentiment and expression. The nation was then in that ferment against the court and the ministry, which some years after ended in the downfall of Sir Robert Walpole; and as it has been said, that Tories are Whigs when out of place, and Whigs, Tories when in place; so, as a Whig administration ruled with what force it could, a Tory opposition had all the animation and all the eloquence of resistance to power, aided by the common topicks of patriotism, liberty, and independence! Accordingly, we find in Johnson&rsquo;s <span class="t8">London</span> the most spirited invectives against tyranny and oppression, the warmest predilection for his own country, and the purest love of virtue; interspersed with traits of his own particular character and situation, not omitting his prejudices as a &lsquo;true-born Englishman,&rsquo; not only against foreign countries, but against Ireland and Scotland. On some of these topicks I shall quote a few passages:</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;The cheated nation&rsquo;s happy fav&rsquo;rites see;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Mark whom the great caress, who frown on me.&rsquo;<br/>&nbsp;&rsquo;Has heaven reserv&rsquo;d in pity to the poor,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;No pathless waste, or undiscover&rsquo;d shore?<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;No secret island in the boundless main?<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;No peaceful desert yet unclaim&rsquo;d by Spain?<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Quick let us rise, the happy seats explore,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;And bear Oppression&rsquo;s insolence no more.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;How, when competitors like these contend,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Can <span class="t8">surly Virtue</span> hope to fix a friend?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;This mournful truth is every where confess&rsquo;d,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;SLOW RISES WORTH, BY POVERTY DEPRESS&rsquo;D!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">We may easily conceive with what feeling a great mind like his, cramped and galled by narrow circumstances, uttered this last line, which he marked by capitals. The whole of the poem is eminently excellent, and there are in it such proofs of a knowledge of the world, and of a mature acquaintance with life, as cannot be contemplated without wonder, when we consider that he was then only in his twenty-ninth year, and had yet been so little in the &lsquo;busy haunts of men.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Yet, while we admire the poetical excellence of this poem, candour obliges us to allow, that the flame of patriotism and zeal for popular resistance with which it is fraught, had no just cause. There was, in truth, no &lsquo;oppression;&rsquo; the &lsquo;nation&rsquo; was not &lsquo;cheated.&rsquo; Sir Robert Walpole was a wise and a benevolent minister, who thought that the happiness and prosperity of a commercial country like ours, would be best promoted by peace, which he accordingly maintained, with credit, during a very long period. Johnson himself afterwards honestly acknowledged the merit of Walpole, whom he called &lsquo;a fixed star;&rsquo; while he characterised his opponent, Pitt, as &lsquo;a meteor.&rsquo; But Johnson&rsquo;s juvenile poem was naturally impregnated with the fire of opposition, and upon every account was universally admired.</p>
<p class="p24">Though thus elevated into fame, and conscious of uncommon powers, he had not that bustling confidence, or, I may rather say, that animated ambition, which one might have supposed would have urged him to endeavour at rising in life. But such was his inflexible dignity of character, that he could not stoop to court the great; without which, hardly any man has made his way to a high station. He could not expect to produce many such works as his <span class="t8">London</span>, and he felt the hardships of writing for bread; he was, therefore, willing to resume the office of a schoolmaster, so as to have a sure, though moderate income for his life; and an offer being made to him of the mastership of a school, provided he could obtain the degree of Master of Arts, Dr. Adams was applied to, by a common friend, to know whether that could be granted him as a favour from the University of Oxford. But though he had made such a figure in the literary world, it was then thought too great a favour to be asked.</p>
<p class="p24">Hawkins (<span class="t8">Life</span>, p. 61) says that &lsquo;Johnson went to Appleby in Aug. 1738, and offered himself as a candidate for the mastership.&rsquo; The date of 1738 seems to be Hawkins&rsquo;s inference. If Johnson went at all, it was in 1739. Pope, the friend of Swift, would not of course have sought Lord Gower&rsquo;s influence with Swift. He applied to his lordship, no doubt, as a great midland-county landowner, likely to have influence with the trustees. Why, when the difficulty about the degree of M.A. was discovered, Pope was not asked to solicit Swift cannot be known. See <span class="t8">post</span>, beginning of 1780 in BOSWELL&rsquo;S account of the <span class="t8">Life of Swift</span>.]</p>
<p class="p24">Pope, without any knowledge of him but from his <span class="t8">London</span>, recommended him to Earl Gower, who endeavoured to procure for him a degree from Dublin, by the following letter to a friend of Dean Swift:</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Mr. Samuel Johnson (authour of <span class="t8">London</span>, a satire, and some other poetical pieces) is a native of this country, and much respected by some worthy gentlemen in his neighbourhood, who are trustees of a charity school now vacant; the certain salary is sixty pounds a year, of which they are desirous to make him master; but, unfortunately, he is not capable of receiving their bounty, which <span class="t8">would make him happy for life</span>, by not being a <span class="t8">Master of Arts</span>; which, by the statutes of this school, the master of it must be.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Now these gentlemen do me the honour to think that I have interest enough in you, to prevail upon you to write to Dean Swift, to persuade the University of Dublin to send a diploma to me, constituting this poor man Master of Arts in their University. They highly extol the man&rsquo;s learning and probity; and will not be persuaded, that the University will make any difficulty of conferring such a favour upon a stranger, if he is recommended by the Dean. They say he is not afraid of the strictest examination, though he is of so long a journey; and will venture it, if the Dean thinks it necessary; choosing rather to die upon the road, <span class="t8">than be starved to death in translating for booksellers</span>; which has been his only subsistence for some time past.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I fear there is more difficulty in this affair, than those good-natured gentlemen apprehend; especially as their election cannot be delayed longer than the 11th of next month. If you see this matter in the same light that it appears to me, I hope you will burn this, and pardon me for giving you so much trouble about an impracticable thing; but, if you think there is a probability of obtaining the favour asked, I am sure your humanity, and propensity to relieve merit in distress, will incline you to serve the poor man, without my adding any more to the trouble I have already given you, than assuring you that I am, with great truth, Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your faithful servant,</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">&lsquo;GOWER.</span></p>
<p class="p21">&lsquo;Trentham, Aug. 1, 1739.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">It was, perhaps, no small disappointment to Johnson that this respectable application had not the desired effect; yet how much reason has there been, both for himself and his country, to rejoice that it did not succeed, as he might probably have wasted in obscurity those hours in which he afterwards produced his incomparable works.</p>
<p class="p24">About this time he made one other effort to emancipate himself from the drudgery of authourship. He applied to Dr. Adams, to consult Dr. Smalbroke of the Commons, whether a person might be permitted to practice as an advocate there, without a doctor&rsquo;s degree in Civil Law. &lsquo;I am (said he) a total stranger to these studies; but whatever is a profession, and maintains numbers, must be within the reach of common abilities, and some degree of industry.&rsquo; Dr. Adams was much pleased with Johnson&rsquo;s design to employ his talents in that manner, being confident he would have attained to great eminence. And, indeed, I cannot conceive a man better qualified to make a distinguished figure as a lawyer; for, he would have brought to his profession a rich store of various knowledge, an uncommon acuteness, and a command of language, in which few could have equalled, and none have surpassed him. He who could display eloquence and wit in defence of the decision of the House of Commons upon Mr. Wilkes&rsquo;s election for Middlesex, and of the unconstitutional taxation of our fellow-subjects in America, must have been a powerful advocate in any cause. But here, also, the want of a degree was an insurmountable bar.</p>
<p class="p24">He was, therefore, under the necessity of persevering in that course, into which he had been forced; and we find, that his proposal from Greenwich to Mr. Cave, for a translation of Father Paul Sarpi&rsquo;s History, was accepted.</p>
<p class="p24">Some sheets of this translation were printed off, but the design was dropt; for it happened, oddly enough, that another person of the name of Samuel Johnson, Librarian of St. Martin&rsquo;s in the Fields, and Curate of that parish, engaged in the same undertaking, and was patronised by the Clergy, particularly by Dr. Pearce, afterwards Bishop of Rochester. Several light skirmishes passed between the rival translators, in the newspapers of the day; and the consequence was, that they destroyed each other, for neither of them went on with the work. It is much to be regretted, that the able performance of that celebrated genius FRA PAOLO, lost the advantage of being incorporated into British literature by the masterly hand of Johnson.</p>
<p class="p24">I have in my possession, by the favour of Mr. John Nichols, a paper in Johnson&rsquo;s hand-writing, entitled &lsquo;Account between Mr. Edward Cave and Sam. Johnson, in relation to a version of Father Paul, &amp;c. begun August the 2d, 1738; &lsquo;by which it appears, that from that day to the 21st of April, 1739, Johnson received for this work, £49 7<span class="t8">s</span>. in sums of one, two, three, and sometimes four guineas at a time, most frequently two. And it is curious to observe the minute and scrupulous accuracy with which Johnson has pasted upon it a slip of paper, which he has entitled Small Account,&rsquo; and which contains one article, &lsquo;Sept. 9th, Mr. Cave laid down 2s. 6d.&rsquo; There is subjoined to this account, a list of some subscribers to the work, partly in Johnson&rsquo;s handwriting, partly in that of another person; and there follows a leaf or two on which are written a number of characters which have the appearance of a short hand, which, perhaps, Johnson was then trying to learn.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To MR. CAVE.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Wednesday.</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I did not care to detain your servant while I wrote an answer to your letter, in which you seem to insinuate that I had promised more than I am ready to perform. If I have raised your expectations by any thing that may have escaped my memory, I am sorry; and if you remind me of it, shall thank you for the favour. If I made fewer alterations than usual in the Debates, it was only because there appeared, and still appears to be, less need of alteration. The verses to Lady Firebrace may be had when you please, for you know that such a subject neither deserves much thought, nor requires it.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The Chinese Stories may be had folded down when you please to send, in which I do not recollect that you desired any alterations to be made.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;An answer to another query I am very willing to write, and had consulted with you about it last night if there had been time; for I think it the most proper way of inviting such a correspondence as may be an advantage to the paper, not a load upon it.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;As to the Prize Verses, a backwardness to determine their degrees of merit is not peculiar to me. You may, if you please, still have what I can say; but I shall engage with little spirit in an affair, which I shall <span class="t8">hardly</span> end to my own satisfaction, and <span class="t8">certainly</span> not to the satisfaction of the parties concerned.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;As to Father Paul, I have not yet been just to my proposal, but have met with impediments, which, I hope, are now at an end; and if you find the progress hereafter not such as you have a right to expect, you can easily stimulate a negligent translator.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;If any or all of these have contributed to your discontent, I will endeavour to remove it; and desire you to propose the question to which you wish for an answer.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am, Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your humble servant,</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To MR. CAVE.</p>
<p class="p24">[No date.]</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am pretty much of your opinion, that the Commentary cannot be prosecuted with any appearance of success; for as the names of the authours concerned are of more weight in the performance than its own intrinsick merit, the publick will be soon satisfied with it. And I think the Examen should be pushed forward with the utmost expedition. Thus, &ldquo;This day, &amp;c., An Examen of Mr. Pope&rsquo;s Essay, &amp;c., containing a succinct Account of the Philosophy of Mr. Leibnitz on the System of the Fatalists, with a Confutation of their Opinions, and an Illustration of the Doctrine of Free-will;&rdquo; [with what else you think proper.]</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;It will, above all, be necessary to take notice, that it is a thing distinct from the Commentary.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I was so far from imagining they stood still, that I conceived them to have a good deal before-hand, and therefore was less anxious in providing them more. But if ever they stand still on my account, it must doubtless be charged to me; and whatever else shall be reasonable, I shall not oppose; but beg a suspense of judgment till morning, when I must entreat you to send me a dozen proposals, and you shall then have copy to spare.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am, Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your&rsquo;s, <span class="t8">impransus</span>,</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.</span></p>
<p class="p21">&lsquo;Pray muster up the Proposals if you can, or let the boy recall them from the booksellers.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">But although he corresponded with Mr. Cave concerning a translation of Crousaz&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Examen</span> of Pope&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Essay on Man</span>, and gave advice as one anxious for its success, I was long ago convinced by a perusal of the Preface, that this translation was erroneously ascribed to him; and I have found this point ascertained, beyond all doubt, by the following article in Dr. Birch&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Manuscripts in the British Museum</span>:</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">&lsquo;ELISÆ CARTERÆ. S. P. D. THOMAS BIRCH.</span></p>
<p class="p21">&lsquo;Versionem tuam Examinis Crousasiani jam perlegi. Summam styli et elegantiam, et in re difficillimâ proprietatem, admiratus.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;<span class="t8">Dabam Novemb</span>. 27° 1738.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Indeed Mrs. Carter has lately acknowledged to Mr. Seward, that she was the translator of the <span class="t8">Examen</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">It is remarkable, that Johnson&rsquo;s last quoted letter to Mr. Cave concludes with a fair confession that he had not a dinner; and it is no less remarkable, that, though in this state of want himself, his benevolent heart was not insensible to the necessities of an humble labourer in literature, as appears from the very next letter:</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To MR. CAVE.</p>
<p class="p24">[No date.]</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;You may remember I have formerly talked with you about a Military Dictionary. The eldest Mr. Macbean, who was with Mr. Chambers, has very good materials for such a work, which I have seen, and will do it at a very low rate. I think the terms of War and Navigation might be comprised, with good explanations, in one 8vo. Pica, which he is willing to do for twelve shillings a sheet, to be made up a guinea at the second impression. If you think on it, I will wait on you with him.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am, Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your humble servant,</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.</span></p>
<p class="p21">&lsquo;Pray lend me Topsel on Animals.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p26">I must not omit to mention, that this Mr. Macbean was a native of<br/>Scotland.</p>
<p class="p24">In the <span class="t8">Gentleman&rsquo;s Magazine</span> of this year, Johnson gave a Life of Father Paul; and he wrote the Preface to the Volume, [dagger] which, though prefixed to it when bound, is always published with the Appendix, and is therefore the last composition belonging to it. The ability and nice adaptation with which he could draw up a prefatory address, was one of his peculiar excellencies.</p>
<p class="p24">It appears too, that he paid a friendly attention to Mrs. Elizabeth Carter; for in a letter from Mr. Cave to Dr. Birch, November 28, this year, I find &lsquo;Mr. Johnson advises Miss C. to undertake a translation of <span class="t8">Boethius de Cons</span>, because there is prose and verse, and to put her name to it when published.&rsquo; This advice was not followed; probably from an apprehension that the work was not sufficiently popular for an extensive sale. How well Johnson himself could have executed a translation of this philosophical poet, we may judge from the following specimen which he has given in the <span class="t8">Rambler</span>: (<span class="t8">Motto to No. 7</span>.)</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;O qui perpetuâ mundum ratione gubernas,<br/>&nbsp;Terrarum cælique sator!<br/>&nbsp;Disjice terrenæ nebulas et pondera molis,<br/>&nbsp;Atque tuo splendore mica! Tu namque serenum,<br/>&nbsp;Tu requies tranquilla piis. Te cernere finis,<br/>&nbsp;Principium, vector, dux, semita, terminus, idem.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;O thou whose power o&rsquo;er moving worlds presides,<br/>&nbsp;Whose voice created, and whose wisdom guides,<br/>&nbsp;On darkling man in pure effulgence shine,<br/>&nbsp;And cheer the clouded mind with light divine.<br/>&rsquo;Tis thine alone to calm the pious breast,<br/>&nbsp;With silent confidence and holy rest;<br/>&nbsp;From thee, great God! we spring, to thee we tend,<br/>&nbsp;Path, motive, guide, original, and end!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">In 1739, beside the assistance which he gave to the Parliamentary Debates, his writings in the <span class="t8">Gentleman&rsquo;s Magazine</span> were, &lsquo;The Life of Boerhaave,&rsquo;[*] in which it is to be observed, that he discovers that love of chymistry which never forsook him; &lsquo;An Appeal to the publick in behalf of the Editor;&rsquo;[dagger] &lsquo;An Address to the Reader;&rsquo;[dagger] &lsquo;An Epigram both in Greek and Latin to Eliza,&rsquo;[*] and also English verses to her;[*] and, &lsquo;A Greek Epigram to Dr. Birch.&rsquo;[*] It has been erroneously supposed, that an Essay published in that Magazine this year, entitled &lsquo;The Apotheosis of Milton,&rsquo; was written by Johnson; and on that supposition it has been improperly inserted in the edition of his works by the Booksellers, after his decease. Were there no positive testimony as to this point, the style of the performance, and the name of Shakspeare not being mentioned in an Essay professedly reviewing the principal English poets, would ascertain it not to be the production of Johnson. But there is here no occasion to resort to internal evidence; for my Lord Bishop of Salisbury (Dr. Douglas) has assured me, that it was written by Guthrie. His separate publications were, &lsquo;A Complete Vindication of the Licensers of the Stage, from the malicious and scandalous Aspersions of Mr. Brooke, Authour of Gustavus Vasa,&rsquo;[*] being an ironical Attack upon them for their Suppression of that Tragedy; and, &lsquo;Marmor Norfolciense; or an Essay on an ancient prophetical Inscription in monkish Rhyme, lately discovered near Lynne in Norfolk, by PROBUS BRITANNICUS.&rsquo;[*] In this performance, he, in a feigned inscription, supposed to have been found in Norfolk, the county of Sir Robert Walpole, then the obnoxious prime minister of this country, inveighs against the Brunswick succession, and the measures of government consequent upon it. To this supposed prophecy he added a Commentary, making each expression apply to the times, with warm Anti-Hanoverian zeal.</p>
<p class="p24">This anonymous pamphlet, I believe, did not make so much noise as was expected, and, therefore, had not a very extensive circulation. Sir John Hawkins relates, that, &lsquo;warrants were issued, and messengers employed to apprehend the authour; who, though he had forborne to subscribe his name to the pamphlet, the vigilance of those in pursuit of him had discovered;&rsquo; and we are informed, that he lay concealed in Lambeth-marsh till the scent after him grew cold. This, however, is altogether without foundation; for Mr. Steele, one of the Secretaries of the Treasury, who amidst a variety of important business, politely obliged me with his attention to my inquiry, informed me, that &lsquo;he directed every possible search to be made in the records of the Treasury and Secretary of State&rsquo;s Office, but could find no trace whatever of any warrant having been issued to apprehend the authour of this pamphlet.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Marmor Norfolciense</span> became exceedingly scarce, so that I, for many years, endeavoured in vain to procure a copy of it. At last I was indebted to the malice of one of Johnson&rsquo;s numerous petty adversaries, who, in 1775, published a new edition of it, &lsquo;with Notes and a Dedication to SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D. by TRIBUNUS;&rsquo; in which some puny scribbler invidiously attempted to found upon it a charge of inconsistency against its authour, because he had accepted of a pension from his present Majesty, and had written in support of the measures of government. As a mortification to such impotent malice, of which there are so many instances towards men of eminence, I am happy to relate, that this <span class="t8">telum imbelle</span> did not reach its exalted object, till about a year after it thus appeared, when I mentioned it to him, supposing that he knew of the re-publication. To my surprize, he had not yet heard of it. He requested me to go directly and get it for him, which I did. He looked at it and laughed, and seemed to be much diverted with the feeble efforts of his unknown adversary, who, I hope, is alive to read this account. &lsquo;Now (said he) here is somebody who thinks he has vexed me sadly; yet, if it had not been for you, you rogue, I should probably never have seen it.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">As Mr. Pope&rsquo;s note concerning Johnson, alluded to in a former page, refers both to his <span class="t8">London</span>, and his <span class="t8">Marmor Norfolciense</span>, I have deferred inserting it till now. I am indebted for it to Dr. Percy, the Bishop of Dromore, who permitted me to copy it from the original in his possession. It was presented to his Lordship by Sir Joshua Reynolds, to whom it was given by the son of Mr. Richardson the painter, the person to whom it is addressed. I have transcribed it with minute exactness, that the peculiar mode of writing, and imperfect spelling of that celebrated poet, may be exhibited to the curious in literature. It justifies Swift&rsquo;s epithet of &lsquo;paper-sparing Pope&rsquo; for it is written on a slip no larger than a common message-card, and was sent to Mr. Richardson, along with the <span class="t8">Imitation of Juvenal</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;This is imitated by one Johnson who put in for a Publick-school in Shropshire, but was disappointed. He has an infirmity of the convulsive kind, that attacks him sometimes, so as to make him a sad Spectacle. Mr. P. from the Merit of this Work which was all the knowledge he had of him endeavour&rsquo;d to serve him without his own application; &amp; wrote to my Ld gore, but he did not succeed. Mr. Johnson published afterwds another Poem in Latin with Notes the whole very Humerous call&rsquo;d the Norfolk Prophecy.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">&lsquo;P.&rsquo;</span></p>
<p class="p21">Johnson had been told of this note; and Sir Joshua Reynolds informed him of the compliment which it contained, but, from delicacy, avoided shewing him the paper itself. When Sir Joshua observed to Johnson that he seemed very desirous to see Pope&rsquo;s note, he answered, &lsquo;Who would not be proud to have such a man as Pope so solicitous in inquiring about him?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">The infirmity to which Mr. Pope alludes, appeared to me also, as I have elsewhere observed, to be of the convulsive kind, and of the nature of that distemper called St. Vitus&rsquo;s dance; and in this opinion I am confirmed by the description which Sydenham gives of that disease. &lsquo;This disorder is a kind of convulsion. It manifests itself by halting or unsteadiness of one of the legs, which the patient draws after him like an ideot. If the hand of the same side be applied to the breast, or any other part of the body, he cannot keep it a moment in the same posture, but it will be drawn into a different one by a convulsion, notwithstanding all his efforts to the contrary.&rsquo; Sir Joshua Reynolds, however, was of a different opinion, and favoured me with the following paper.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Those motions or tricks of Dr. Johnson are improper&rsquo;y called convulsions. He could sit motionless, when he was told so to do, as well as any other man; my opinion is that it proceeded from a habit which he had indulged himself in, of accompanying his thoughts with certain untoward actions, and those actions always appeared to me as if they were meant to reprobate some part of his past conduct. Whenever he was not engaged in conversation, such thoughts were sure to rush into his mind; and, for this reason, any company, any employment whatever, he preferred to being alone. The great business of his life (he said) was to escape from himself; this disposition he considered as the disease of his mind, which nothing cured but company.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;One instance of his absence and particularity, as it is characteristick of the man, may be worth relating. When he and I took a journey together into the West, we visited the late Mr. Banks, of Dorsetshire; the conversation turning upon pictures, which Johnson could not well see, he retired to a corner of the room, stretching out his right leg as far as he could reach before him, then bringing up his left leg, and stretching his right still further on. The old gentleman observing him, went up to him, and in a very courteous manner assured him, that though it was not a new house, the flooring was perfectly safe. The Doctor started from his reverie, like a person waked out of his sleep, but spoke not a word.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">While we are on this subject, my readers may not be displeased with another anecdote, communicated to me by the same friend, from the relation of Mr. Hogarth.</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson used to be a pretty frequent visitor at the house of Mr. Richardson, authour of <span class="t8">Clarissa</span>, and other novels of extensive reputation. Mr. Hogarth came one day to see Richardson, soon after the execution of Dr. Cameron, for having taken arms for the house of Stuart in 1745-6; and being a warm partisan of George the Second, he observed to Richardson, that certainly there must have been some very unfavourable circumstances lately discovered in this particular case, which had induced the King to approve of an execution for rebellion so long after the time when it was committed, as this had the appearance of putting a man to death in cold blood, and was very unlike his Majesty&rsquo;s usual clemency. While he was talking, he perceived a person standing at a window in the room, shaking his head, and rolling himself about in a strange ridiculous manner. He concluded that he was an ideot, whom his relations had put under the care of Mr. Richardson, as a very good man. To his great surprize, however, this figure stalked forwards to where he and Mr. Richardson were sitting, and all at once took up the argument, and burst out into an invective against George the Second, as one, who, upon all occasions, was unrelenting and barbarous; mentioning many instances, particularly, that when an officer of high rank had been acquitted by a Court Martial, George the Second had with his own hand, struck his name off the list. In short, he displayed such a power of eloquence, that Hogarth looked at him with astonishment, and actually imagined that this ideot had been at the moment inspired. Neither Hogarth nor Johnson were made known to each other at this interview.</p>
<p class="p24">[1740: ÆTAT. 31.] &mdash; In 1740 he wrote for the <span class="t8">Gentleman&rsquo;s Magazine</span> the &lsquo;Preface,&rsquo;[dagger] &lsquo;Life of Sir Francis Drake,&rsquo;[*] and the first parts of those of &lsquo;Admiral Blake,&rsquo;[*] and of &lsquo;Philip Baretier,&rsquo; both which he finished the following year. He also wrote an &lsquo;Essay on Epitaphs,&rsquo; and an &lsquo;Epitaph on Philips, a Musician,&rsquo; which was afterwards published with some other pieces of his, in Mrs. Williams&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Miscellanies</span>. This Epitaph is so exquisitely beautiful, that I remember even Lord Kames, strangely prejudiced as he was against Dr. Johnson, was compelled to allow it very high praise. It has been ascribed to Mr. Garrick, from its appearing at first with the signature G; but I have heard Mr. Garrick declare, that it was written by Dr. Johnson, and give the following account of the manner in which it was composed. Johnson and he were sitting together; when, amongst other things, Garrick repeated an Epitaph upon this Philips by a Dr. Wilkes, in these words:</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;Exalted soul! whose harmony could please<br/>The love-sick virgin, and the gouty ease;<br/>Could jarring discord, like Amphion, move<br/>To beauteous order and harmonious love;<br/>Rest here in peace, till angels bid thee rise,<br/>And meet thy blessed Saviour in the skies.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson shook his head at these common-place funereal lines, and said to Garrick, &lsquo;I think, Davy, I can make a better.&rsquo; Then, stirring about his tea for a little while, in a state of meditation, he almost extempore produced the following verses:</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;Philips, whose touch harmonious could remove<br/>The pangs of guilty power or hapless love;<br/>Rest here, distress&rsquo;d by poverty no more,<br/>Here find that calm thou gav&rsquo;st so oft before;<br/>Sleep, undisturb&rsquo;d, within this peaceful shrine,<br/>Till angels wake thee with a note like thine!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">At the same time that Mr. Garrick favoured me with this anecdote, he repeated a very pointed Epigram by Johnson, on George the Second and Colley Cibber, which has never yet appeared, and of which I know not the exact date. Dr. Johnson afterwards gave it to me himself:</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;Augustus still survives in Maro&rsquo;s strain,<br/>And Spenser&rsquo;s verse prolongs Eliza&rsquo;s reign;<br/>Great George&rsquo;s acts let tuneful Cibber sing;<br/>For Nature form&rsquo;d the Poet for the King.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">In 1741[*] he wrote for the <span class="t8">Gentleman&rsquo;s Magazine</span> &lsquo;the Preface,&rsquo;[*] &lsquo;Conclusion of his lives of Drake and Baretier,&rsquo;[dagger] &lsquo;A free translation of the Jests of Hierocles, with an Introduction;&rsquo;[dagger] and, I think, the following pieces: &lsquo;Debate on the Proposal of Parliament to Cromwell, to assume the Title of King, abridged, modified, and digested;&rsquo;[dagger] &lsquo;Translation of Abbé Guyon&rsquo;s Dissertation on the Amazons;&rsquo;[dagger] &lsquo;Translation of Fontenelle&rsquo;s Panegyrick on Dr. Morin.&rsquo;[dagger] Two notes upon this appear to me undoubtedly his. He this year, and the two following, wrote the <span class="t8">Parliamentary Debates</span>. He told me himself, that he was the sole composer of them for those three years only. He was not, however, precisely exact in his statement, which he mentioned from hasty recollection; for it is sufficiently evident, that his composition of them began November 19, 1740, and ended February 23, 1742-3.</p>
<p class="p24">It appears from some of Cave&rsquo;s letters to Dr. Birch, that Cave had better assistance for that branch of his Magazine, than has been generally supposed; and that he was indefatigable in getting it made as perfect as he could.</p>
<p class="p24">Thus, 21st July, 1735. &lsquo;I trouble you with the inclosed, because you said you could easily correct what is here given for Lord C &mdash;&mdash; ld&rsquo;s speech. I beg you will do so as soon as you can for me, because the month is far advanced.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">And 15th July, 1737. &lsquo;As you remember the debates so far as to perceive the speeches already printed are not exact, I beg the favour that you will peruse the inclosed, and, in the best manner your memory will serve, correct the mistaken passages, or add any thing that is omitted. I should be very glad to have something of the Duke of N &mdash; le&rsquo;s speech, which would be particularly of service.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;A gentleman has Lord Bathurst&rsquo;s speech to add something to.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">And July 3, 1744. &lsquo;You will see what stupid, low, abominable stuff is put upon your noble and learned friend&rsquo;s character, such as I should quite reject, and endeavour to do something better towards doing justice to the character. But as I cannot expect to attain my desires in that respect, it would be a great satisfaction, as well as an honour to our work to have the favour of the genuine speech. It is a method that several have been pleased to take, as I could show, but I think myself under a restraint. I shall say so far, that I have had some by a third hand, which I understood well enough to come from the first; others by penny-post, and others by the speakers themselves, who have been pleased to visit St. John&rsquo;s Gate, and show particular marks of their being pleased.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">There is no reason, I believe, to doubt the veracity of Cave. It is, however, remarkable, that none of these letters are in the years during which Johnson alone furnished the Debates, and one of them is in the very year after he ceased from that labour. Johnson told me that as soon as he found that the speeches were thought genuine, he determined that he would write no more of them; for &lsquo;he would not be accessary to the propagation of falsehood.&rsquo; And such was the tenderness of his conscience, that a short time before his death he expressed his regret for his having been the authour of fictions, which had passed for realities.</p>
<p class="p24">He nevertheless agreed with me in thinking, that the debates which he had framed were to be valued as orations upon questions of publick importance. They have accordingly been collected in volumes, properly arranged, and recommended to the notice of parliamentary speakers by a preface, written by no inferior hand. I must, however, observe, that although there is in those debates a wonderful store of political information, and very powerful eloquence, I cannot agree that they exhibit the manner of each particular speaker, as Sir John Hawkins seems to think. But, indeed, what opinion can we have of his judgement, and taste in publick speaking, who presumes to give, as the characteristicks of two celebrated orators, &lsquo;the deep-mouthed rancour of Pulteney, and the yelping pertinacity of Pitt.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">This year I find that his tragedy of <span class="t8">Irene</span> had been for some time ready for the stage, and that his necessities made him desirous of getting as much as he could for it, without delay; for there is the following letter from Mr. Cave to Dr. Birch, in the same volume of manuscripts in the British Museum, from which I copied those above quoted. They were most obligingly pointed out to me by Sir William Musgrave, one of the Curators of that noble repository.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Sept. 9, 1741.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I have put Mr. Johnson&rsquo;s play into Mr. Gray&rsquo;s hands, in order to sell it to him, if he is inclined to buy it; but I doubt whether he will or not. He would dispose of the copy, and whatever advantage may be made by acting it. Would your society, or any gentleman, or body of men that you know, take such a bargain? He and I are very unfit to deal with theatrical persons. Fleetwood was to have acted it last season, but Johnson&rsquo;s diffidence or &mdash;&mdash; prevented it.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I have already mentioned that <span class="t8">Irene</span> was not brought into publick notice till Garrick was manager of Drury-lane theatre.</p>
<p class="p24">1742: ÆTAT. 33. &mdash; In 1742 he wrote for the <span class="t8">Gentleman&rsquo;s Magazine</span> the &lsquo;Preface,[dagger] the &lsquo;Parliamentary Debates,&rsquo;[*] &lsquo;Essay on the Account of the conduct of the Duchess of Marlborough,&rsquo;[*] then the popular topick of conversation. This &lsquo;Essay&rsquo; is a short but masterly performance. We find him in No. 13 of his <span class="t8">Rambler</span>, censuring a profligate sentiment in that &lsquo;Account;&rsquo; and again insisting upon it strenuously in conversation. &lsquo;An account of the Life of Peter Burman,&rsquo;[*] I believe chiefly taken from a foreign publication; as, indeed, he could not himself know much about Burman; &lsquo;Additions to his Life of Baretier;&rsquo;[*] &lsquo;The Life of Sydenham,&rsquo;[*] afterwards prefixed to Dr. Swan&rsquo;s edition of his works; &lsquo;Proposals for Printing Bibliotheca Harleiana, or a Catalogue of the Library of the Earl of Oxford.&rsquo;[*] His account of that celebrated collection of books, in which he displays the importance to literature of what the French call a <span class="t8">catalogue raisonné</span>, when the subjects of it are extensive and various, and it is executed with ability, cannot fail to impress all his readers with admiration of his philological attainments. It was afterwards prefixed to the first volume of the Catalogue, in which the Latin accounts of books were written by him. He was employed in this business by Mr. Thomas Osborne the bookseller, who purchased the library for 13,000£., a sum which Mr. Oldys says, in one of his manuscripts, was not more than the binding of the books had cost; yet, as Dr. Johnson assured me, the slowness of the sale was such, that there was not much gained by it. It has been confidently related, with many embellishments, that Johnson one day knocked Osborne down in his shop, with a folio, and put his foot upon his neck. The simple truth I had from Johnson himself. &lsquo;Sir, he was impertinent to me, and I beat him. But it was not in his shop: it was in my own chamber.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">A very diligent observer may trace him where we should not easily suppose him to be found. I have no doubt that he wrote the little abridgement entitled &lsquo;Foreign History,&rsquo; in the <span class="t8">Magazine</span> for December. To prove it, I shall quote the Introduction. &lsquo;As this is that season of the year in which Nature may be said to command a suspension of hostilities, and which seems intended, by putting a short stop to violence and slaughter, to afford time for malice to relent, and animosity to subside; we can scarce expect any other accounts than of plans, negotiations and treaties, of proposals for peace, and preparations for war.&rsquo; As also this passage: &lsquo;Let those who despise the capacity of the Swiss, tell us by what wonderful policy, or by what happy conciliation of interests, it is brought to pass, that in a body made up of different communities and different religions, there should be no civil commotions, though the people are so warlike, that to nominate and raise an army is the same.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I am obliged to Mr. Astle for his ready permission to copy the two following letters, of which the originals are in his possession. Their contents shew that they were written about this time, and that Johnson was now engaged in preparing an historical account of the British Parliament.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To MR. CAVE.</p>
<p class="p24">[<span class="t8">No date</span>]</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I believe I am going to write a long letter, and have therefore taken a whole sheet of paper. The first thing to be written about is our historical design.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;You mentioned the proposal of printing in numbers, as an alteration in the scheme, but I believe you mistook, some way or other, my meaning; I had no other view than that you might rather print too many of five sheets, than of five and thirty.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;With regard to what I shall say on the manner of proceeding, I would have it understood as wholly indifferent to me, and my opinion only, not my resolution. <span class="t8">Emptoris sit eligere</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I think the insertion of the exact dates of the most important events in the margin, or of so many events as may enable the reader to regulate the order of facts with sufficient exactness, the proper medium between a journal, which has regard only to time, and a history which ranges facts according to their dependence on each other, and postpones or anticipates according to the convenience of narration. I think the work ought to partake of the spirit of history, which is contrary to minute exactness, and of the regularity of a journal, which is inconsistent with spirit. For this reason, I neither admit numbers or dates, nor reject them.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am of your opinion with regard to placing most of the resolutions &amp;c., in the margin, and think we shall give the most complete account of Parliamentary proceedings that can be contrived. The naked papers, without an historical treatise interwoven, require some other book to make them understood. I will date the succeeding facts with some exactness, but I think in the margin. You told me on Saturday that I had received money on this work, and found set down 13£. 2s. 6d., reckoning the half guinea of last Saturday. As you hinted to me that you had many calls for money, I would not press you too hard, and therefore shall desire only, as I send it in, two guineas for a sheet of copy; the rest you may pay me when it may be more convenient; and even by this sheet-payment I shall, for some time, be very expensive.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The <span class="t8">Life of Savage</span> I am ready to go upon; and in Great Primer, and Pica notes, I reckon on sending in half a sheet a day; but the money for that shall likewise lye by in your hands till it is done. With the debates, shall not I have business enough? if I had but good pens.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Towards Mr. Savage&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Life</span> what more have you got? I would willingly have his trial, &amp;c., and know whether his defence be at Bristol, and would have his collection of poems, on account of the Preface. &mdash; <span class="t8">The Plain Dealer</span>, &mdash; all the magazines that have anything of his, or relating to him.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I thought my letter would be long, but it is now ended; and I am, Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Yours, &amp;c. SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The boy found me writing this almost in the dark, when I could not quite easily read yours.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I have read the Italian &mdash; nothing in it is well.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I had no notion of having any thing for the Inscription. I hope you don&rsquo;t think I kept it to extort a price. I could think of nothing, till to day. If you could spare me another guinea for the history, I should take it very kindly, to night; but if you do not I shall not think it an injury. &mdash; I am almost well again.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To MR. CAVE.</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;You did not tell me your determination about the &lsquo;Soldier&rsquo;s Letter,&rsquo; which I am confident was never printed. I think it will not do by itself, or in any other place, so well as the <span class="t8">Mag. Extraordinary</span>. If you will have it at all, I believe you do not think I set it high, and I will be glad if what you give, you will give quickly.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;You need not be in care about something to print, for I have got the State Trials, and shall extract Layer, Atterbury, and Macclesfield from them, and shall bring them to you in a fortnight; after which I will try to get the South Sea Report.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">[<span class="t8">No date, nor signature</span>]</p>
<p class="p24">I would also ascribe to him an &lsquo;Essay on the Description of China, from the French of Du Halde.[dagger]</p>
<p class="p24">His writings in the <span class="t8">Gentleman&rsquo;s Magazine</span> in 1743, are, the &lsquo;Preface,&rsquo;[dagger] the &lsquo;Parliamentary Debates,&rsquo;[dagger] &lsquo;Considerations on the Dispute between Crousaz and Warburton, on Pope&rsquo;s Essay on Man;&rsquo;[dagger] in which, while he defends Crousaz, he shews an admirable metaphysical acuteness and temperance in controversy; &lsquo;Ad Lauram parituram Epigramma;&rsquo;[*] and, &lsquo;A Latin Translation of Pope&rsquo;s Verses on his Grotto;&rsquo;[*] and, as he could employ his pen with equal success upon a small matter as a great, I suppose him to be the authour of an advertisement for Osborne, concerning the great Harlcian Catalogue.</p>
<p class="p24">But I should think myself much wanting, both to my illustrious friend and my readers, did I not introduce here, with more than ordinary respect, an exquisitely beautiful Ode, which has not been inserted in any of the collections of Johnson&rsquo;s poetry, written by him at a very early period, as Mr. Hector informs me, and inserted in the <span class="t8">Gentleman&rsquo;s Magazine</span> of this year.</p>
<p class="p24">FRIENDSHIP, <span class="t8">an</span> ODE.[*]</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;Friendship, peculiar boon of heav&rsquo;n,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;The noble mind&rsquo;s delight and pride,<br/>To men and angels only giv&rsquo;n,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;To all the lower world deny&rsquo;d.</p>
<p class="p26">While love, unknown among the blest,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Parent of thousand wild desires,<br/>The savage and the human breast<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Torments alike with raging fires;</p>
<p class="p26">With bright, but oft destructive, gleam,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Alike o&rsquo;er all his lightnings fly;<br/>Thy lambent glories only beam<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Around the fav&rsquo;rites of the sky.</p>
<p class="p26">Thy gentle flows of guiltless joys<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;On fools and villains ne&rsquo;er descend;<br/>In vain for thee the tyrant sighs,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;And hugs a flatterer for a friend.</p>
<p class="p26">Directress of the brave and just,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;O guide us through life&rsquo;s darksome way!<br/>And let the tortures of mistrust<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;On selfish bosoms only prey.</p>
<p class="p26">Nor shall thine ardours cease to glow,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;When souls to blissful climes remove;<br/>What rais&rsquo;d our virtue here below,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall aid our happiness above.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson had now an opportunity of obliging his schoolfellow Dr. James, of whom he once observed, &lsquo;no man brings more mind to his profession.&rsquo; James published this year his <span class="t8">Medicinal Dictionary</span>, in three volumes folio. Johnson, as I understood from him, had written, or assisted in writing, the proposals for this work; and being very fond of the study of physick, in which James was his master, he furnished some of the articles. He, however, certainly wrote for it the Dedication to Dr. Mead,[dagger] which is conceived with great address, to conciliate the patronage of that very eminent man.</p>
<p class="p24">It has been circulated, I know not with what authenticity, that Johnson considered Dr. Birch as a dull writer, and said of him, &lsquo;Tom Birch is as brisk as a bee in conversation; but no sooner does he take a pen in his hand, than it becomes a torpedo to him, and benumbs all his faculties.&rsquo; That the literature of this country is much indebted to Birch&rsquo;s activity and diligence must certainly be acknowledged. We have seen that Johnson honoured him with a Greek Epigram; and his correspondence with him, during many years, proves that he had no mean opinion of him.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To DR. BIRCH.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Thursday, Sept. 29, 1743.</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I hope you will excuse me for troubling you on an occasion on which I know not whom else I can apply to; I am at a loss for the Lives and Characters of Earl Stanhope, the two Craggs, and the minister Sunderland; and beg that you will inform [me] where I may find them, and send any pamphlets, &amp;c. relating to them to Mr. Cave, to be perused for a few days by, Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your most humble servant,</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">His circumstances were at this time much embarrassed; yet his affection for his mother was so warm, and so liberal, that he took upon himself a debt of her&rsquo;s, which, though small in itself, was then considerable to him. This appears from the following letter which he wrote to Mr. Levett, of Lichfield, the original of which lies now before me.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To MR. LEVETT; IN LICHFIELD.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;December 1, 1743.</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am extremely sorry that we have encroached so much upon your forbearance with respect to the interest, which a great perplexity of affairs hindered me from thinking of with that attention that I ought, and which I am not immediately able to remit to you, but will pay it (I think twelve pounds,) in two months. I look upon this, and on the future interest of that mortgage, as my own debt; and beg that you will be pleased to give me directions how to pay it, and not mention it to my dear mother. If it be necessary to pay this in less time, I believe I can do it; but I take two months for certainty, and beg an answer whether you can allow me so much time. I think myself very much obliged to your forbearance, and shall esteem it a great happiness to be able to serve you. I have great opportunities of dispersing any thing that you may think it proper to make publick. I will give a note for the money, payable at the time mentioned, to any one here that you shall appoint. I am, Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your most obedient,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;And most humble servant,</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.</span></p>
<p class="p21">&lsquo;At Mr. Osborne&rsquo;s, bookseller, in Gray&rsquo;s Inn.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">1744: ÆTAT. 35. &mdash; It does not appear that he wrote any thing in 1744 for the <span class="t8">Gentleman&rsquo;s Magazine</span>, but the Preface.[Dagger] His <span class="t8">Life of Baretier</span> was now re-published in a pamphlet by itself. But he produced one work this year, fully sufficient to maintain the high reputation which he had acquired. This was <span class="t8">The Life of Richard Savage</span>;[*] a man, of whom it is difficult to speak impartially, without wondering that he was for some time the intimate companion of Johnson; for his character was marked by profligacy, insolence, and ingratitude: yet, as he undoubtedly had a warm and vigorous, though unregulated mind, had seen life in all its varieties, and been much in the company of the statesmen and wits of his time, he could communicate to Johnson an abundant supply of such materials as his philosophical curiosity most eagerly desired; and as Savage&rsquo;s misfortunes and misconduct had reduced him to the lowest state of wretchedness as a writer for bread, his visits to St. John&rsquo;s Gate naturally brought Johnson and him together.</p>
<p class="p24">It is melancholy to reflect, that Johnson and Savage were sometimes in such extreme indigence, that they could not pay for a lodging; so that they have wandered together whole nights in the streets. Yet in these almost incredible scenes of distress, we may suppose that Savage mentioned many of the anecdotes with which Johnson afterwards enriched the life of his unhappy companion, and those of other Poets.</p>
<p class="p24">He told Sir Joshua Reynolds, that one night in particular, when Savage and he walked round St. James&rsquo;s-square for want of a lodging, they were not at all depressed by their situation; but in high spirits and brimful of patriotism, traversed the square for several hours, inveighed against the minister, and &lsquo;resolved they would <span class="t8">stand by their country</span>.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I am afraid, however, that by associating with Savage, who was habituated to the dissipation and licentiousness of the town, Johnson, though his good principles remained steady, did not entirely preserve that conduct, for which, in days of greater simplicity, he was remarked by his friend Mr. Hector; but was imperceptibly led into some indulgencies which occasioned much distress to his virtuous mind.</p>
<p class="p24">That Johnson was anxious that an authentick and favourable account of his extraordinary friend should first get possession of the publick attention, is evident from a letter which he wrote in the <span class="t8">Gentleman&rsquo;s Magazine</span> for August of the year preceding its publication.</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">&lsquo;MR. URBAN,</span></p>
<p class="p21">&lsquo;As your collections show how often you have owed the ornaments of your poetical pages to the correspondence of the unfortunate and ingenious Mr. Savage, I doubt not but you have so much regard to his memory as to encourage any design that may have a tendency to the preservation of it from insults or calumnies; and therefore, with some degree of assurance, intreat you to inform the publick, that his life will speedily be published by a person who was favoured with his confidence, and received from himself an account of most of the transactions which he proposes to mention, to the time of his retirement to Swansea in Wales.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;From that period, to his death in the prison of Bristol, the account will be continued from materials still less liable to objection; his own letters, and those of his friends, some of which will be inserted in the work, and abstracts of others subjoined in the margin.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;It may be reasonably imagined, that others may have the same design; but as it is not credible that they can obtain the same materials, it must be expected they will supply from invention the want of intelligence; and that under the title of &ldquo;The Life of Savage,&rdquo; they will publish only a novel, filled with romantick adventures, and imaginary amours. You may therefore, perhaps, gratify the lovers of truth and wit, by giving me leave to inform them in your Magazine, that my account will be published in 8vo. by Mr. Roberts, in Warwick-lane.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">[<span class="t8">No signature</span>.]</p>
<p class="p24">In February, 1744, it accordingly came forth from the shop of Roberts, between whom and Johnson I have not traced any connection, except the casual one of this publication. In Johnson&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Life of Savage</span>, although it must be allowed that its moral is the reverse of&mdash; &lsquo;<span class="t8">Respicere exemplar vita morumque jubebo</span>,&rsquo; a very useful lesson is inculcated, to guard men of warm passions from a too free indulgence of them; and the various incidents are related in so clear and animated a manner, and illuminated throughout with so much philosophy, that it is one of the most interesting narratives in the English language. Sir Joshua Reynolds told me, that upon his return from Italy he met with it in Devonshire, knowing nothing of its authour, and began to read it while he was standing with his arm leaning against a chimney-piece. It seized his attention so strongly, that, not being able to lay down the book till he had finished it, when he attempted to move, he found his arm totally benumbed. The rapidity with which this work was composed, is a wonderful circumstance. Johnson has been heard to say, &lsquo;I wrote forty-eight of the printed octavo pages of the <span class="t8">Life of Savage</span> at a sitting; but then I sat up all night.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He exhibits the genius of Savage to the best advantage in the specimens of his poetry which he has selected, some of which are of uncommon merit. We, indeed, occasionally find such vigour and such point, as might make us suppose that the generous aid of Johnson had been imparted to his friend. Mr. Thomas Warton made this remark to me; and, in support of it, quoted from the poem entitled <span class="t8">The Bastard</span>, a line, in which the fancied superiority of one &lsquo;stamped in Nature&rsquo;s mint with extasy,&rsquo; is contrasted with a regular lawful descendant of some great and ancient family:</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;No tenth transmitter of a foolish face.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">But the fact is, that this poem was published some years before Johnson and Savage were acquainted.</p>
<p class="p24">It is remarkable, that in this biographical disquisition there appears a very strong symptom of Johnson&rsquo;s prejudice against players; a prejudice which may be attributed to the following causes: first, the imperfection of his organs, which were so defective that he was not susceptible of the fine impressions which theatrical excellence produces upon the generality of mankind; secondly, the cold rejection of his tragedy; and, lastly, the brilliant success of Garrick, who had been his pupil, who had come to London at the same time with him, not in a much more prosperous state than himself, and whose talents he undoubtedly rated low, compared with his own. His being outstripped by his pupil in the race of immediate fame, as well as of fortune, probably made him feel some indignation, as thinking that whatever might be Garrick&rsquo;s merits in his art, the reward was too great when compared with what the most successful efforts of literary labour could attain. At all periods of his life Johnson used to talk contemptuously of players; but in this work he speaks of them with peculiar acrimony; for which, perhaps, there was formerly too much reason from the licentious and dissolute manners of those engaged in that profession. It is but justice to add, that in our own time such a change has taken place, that there is no longer room for such an unfavourable distinction.</p>
<p class="p24">His schoolfellow and friend, Dr. Taylor, told me a pleasant anecdote of Johnson&rsquo;s triumphing over his pupil David Garrick. When that great actor had played some little time at Goodman&rsquo;s fields, Johnson and Taylor went to see him perform, and afterwards passed the evening at a tavern with him and old Giffard. Johnson, who was ever depreciating stage-players, after censuring some mistakes in emphasis which Garrick had committed in the course of that night&rsquo;s acting, said, &lsquo;the players, Sir, have got a kind of rant, with which they run on, without any regard either to accent or emphasis.&rsquo; Both Garrick and Giffard were offended at this sarcasm, and endeavoured to refute it; upon which Johnson rejoined, &lsquo;Well now, I&rsquo;ll give you something to speak, with which you are little acquainted, and then we shall see how just my observation is. That shall be the criterion. Let me hear you repeat the ninth Commandment, &ldquo;Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour.&rdquo;&rsquo; Both tried at it, said Dr. Taylor, and both mistook the emphasis, which should be upon <span class="t8">not</span> and <span class="t8">false witness</span>. Johnson put them right, and enjoyed his victory with great glee.</p>
<p class="p24">His <span class="t8">Life of Savage</span> was no sooner published, than the following liberal praise was given to it, in <span class="t8">The Champion</span>, a periodical paper: &lsquo;This pamphlet is, without flattery to its authour, as just and well written a piece as of its kind I ever saw; so that at the same time that it highly deserves, it certainly stands very little in need of this recommendation. As to the history of the unfortunate person, whose memoirs compose this work, it is certainly penned with equal accuracy and spirit, of which I am so much the better judge, as I know many of the facts mentioned to be strictly true, and very fairly related. Besides, it is not only the story of Mr. Savage, but innumerable incidents relating to other persons, and other affairs, which renders this a very amusing, and, withal, a very instructive and valuable performance. The author&rsquo;s observations are short, significant, and just, as his narrative is remarkably smooth, and well disposed. His reflections open to all the recesses of the human heart; and, in a word, a more just or pleasant, a more engaging or a more improving treatise, on all the excellencies and defects of human nature, is scarce to be found in our own, or, perhaps, any other language.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson&rsquo;s partiality for Savage made him entertain no doubt of his story, however extraordinary and improbable. It never occurred to him to question his being the son of the Countess of Macclesfield, of whose unrelenting barbarity he so loudly complained, and the particulars of which are related in so strong and affecting a manner in Johnson&rsquo;s life of him. Johnson was certainly well warranted in publishing his narrative, however offensive it might be to the lady and her relations, because her alledged unnatural and cruel conduct to her son, and shameful avowal of guilt, were stated in a <span class="t8">Life of Savage</span> now lying before me, which came out so early as 1727, and no attempt had been made to confute it, or to punish the authour or printer as a libeller: but for the honour of human nature, we should be glad to find the shocking tale not true; and, from a respectable gentleman connected with the lady&rsquo;s family, I have received such information and remarks, as joined to my own inquiries, will, I think, render it at least somewhat doubtful, especially when we consider that it must have originated from the person himself who went by the name of Richard Savage.</p>
<p class="p24">If the maxim <span class="t8">falsum in uno, falsum in omnibus</span>, were to be received without qualification, the credit of Savage&rsquo;s narrative, as conveyed to us, would be annihilated; for it contains some assertions which, beyond a question, are not true.</p>
<p class="p24">1. In order to induce a belief that Earl Rivers, on account of a criminal connection with whom, Lady Macclesfield is said to have been divorced from her husband, by Act of Parliament, had a peculiar anxiety about the child which she bore to him, it is alledged, that his Lordship gave him his own name, and had it duly recorded in the register of St. Andrew&rsquo;s, Holborn. I have carefully inspected that register, but no such entry is to be found.</p>
<p class="p24">2. It is stated, that &lsquo;Lady Macclesfield having lived for some time upon very uneasy terms with her husband, thought a publick confession of adultery the most obvious and expeditious method of obtaining her liberty;&rsquo; and Johnson, assuming this to be true, stigmatises her with indignation, as &lsquo;the wretch who had, without scruple, proclaimed herself an adulteress.&rsquo; But I have perused the Journals of both houses of Parliament at the period of her divorce, and there find it authentically ascertained, that so far from voluntarily submitting to the ignominious charge of adultery, she made a strenuous defence by her Counsel; the bill having been first moved 15th January, 1697, in the House of Lords, and proceeded on, (with various applications for time to bring up witnesses at a distance, &amp;c.) at intervals, till the 3d of March, when it passed. It was brought to the Commons, by a message from the Lords, the 5th of March, proceeded on the 7th, 10th, 11th, 14th, and 15th, on which day, after a full examination of witnesses on both sides, and hearing of Counsel, it was reported without amendments, passed, and carried to the Lords.</p>
<p class="p24">That Lady Macclesfield was convicted of the crime of which she was accused, cannot be denied; but the question now is, whether the person calling himself Richard Savage was her son.</p>
<p class="p24">It has been said, that when Earl Rivers was dying, and anxious to provide for all his natural children, he was informed by Lady Macclesfield that her son by him was dead. Whether, then, shall we believe that this was a malignant lie, invented by a mother to prevent her own child from receiving the bounty of his father, which was accordingly the consequence, if the person whose life Johnson wrote, was her son; or shall we not rather believe that the person who then assumed the name of Richard Savage was an impostor, being in reality the son of the shoemaker, under whose wife&rsquo;s care Lady Macclesfield&rsquo;s child was placed; that after the death of the real Richard Savage, he attempted to personate him; and that the fraud being known to Lady Macclesfield, he was therefore repulsed by her with just resentment?</p>
<p class="p24">There is a strong circumstance in support of the last supposition, though it has been mentioned as an aggravation of Lady Macclesfield&rsquo;s unnatural conduct, and that is, her having prevented him from obtaining the benefit of a legacy left to him by Mrs. Lloyd his god-mother. For if there was such a legacy left, his not being able to obtain payment of it, must be imputed to his consciousness that he was not the real person. The just inference should be, that by the death of Lady Macclesfield&rsquo;s child before its god-mother, the legacy became lapsed, and therefore that Johnson&rsquo;s Richard Savage was an impostor. If he had a title to the legacy, he could not have found any difficulty in recovering it; for had the executors resisted his claim, the whole costs, as well as the legacy, must have been paid by them, if he had been the child to whom it was given.</p>
<p class="p24">The talents of Savage, and the mingled fire, rudeness, pride, meanness, and ferocity of his character, concur in making it credible that he was fit to plan and carry on an ambitious and daring scheme of imposture, similar instances of which have not been wanting in higher spheres, in the history of different countries, and have had a considerable degree of success.</p>
<p class="p24">Yet, on the other hand, to the companion of Johnson, (who through whatever medium he was conveyed into this world, &mdash; be it ever so doubtful &lsquo;To whom related, or by whom begot,&rsquo; was, unquestionably, a man of no common endowments,) we must allow the weight of general repute as to his <span class="t8">Status</span> or parentage, though illicit; and supposing him to be an impostor, it seems strange that Lord Tyrconnel, the nephew of Lady Macclesfield, should patronise him, and even admit him as a guest in his family. Lastly, it must ever appear very suspicious, that three different accounts of the Life of Richard Savage, one published in <span class="t8">The Plain Dealer</span>, in 1724, another in 1727, and another by the powerful pen of Johnson, in 1744, and all of them while Lady Macclesfield was alive, should, notwithstanding the severe attacks upon her, have been suffered to pass without any publick and effectual contradiction.</p>
<p class="p24">I have thus endeavoured to sum up the evidence upon the case, as fairly as I can; and the result seems to be, that the world must vibrate in a state of uncertainty as to what was the truth.</p>
<p class="p24">This digression, I trust, will not be censured, as it relates to a matter exceedingly curious, and very intimately connected with Johnson, both as a man and an authour.</p>
<p class="p24">He this year wrote the <span class="t8">Preface to the Harleian Miscellany</span>[*] The selection of the pamphlets of which it was composed was made by Mr. Oldys, a man of eager curiosity and indefatigable diligence, who first exerted that spirit of inquiry into the literature of the old English writers, by which the works of our great dramatick poet have of late been so signally illustrated.</p>
<p class="p24">In 1745 he published a pamphlet entitled <span class="t8">Miscellaneous Observations on the Tragedy of Macbeth, with remarks on Sir T.H.&rsquo;s (Sir Thomas Hammer&rsquo;s) Edition of Shakspeare</span>.[*] To which he affixed, proposals for a new edition of that poet.</p>
<p class="p24">As we do not trace any thing else published by him during the course of this year, we may conjecture that he was occupied entirely with that work. But the little encouragement which was given by the publick to his anonymous proposals for the execution of a task which Warburton was known to have undertaken, probably damped his ardour. His pamphlet, however, was highly esteemed, and was fortunate enough to obtain the approbation even of the supercilious Warburton himself, who, in the Preface to his <span class="t8">Shakspeare</span> published two years afterwards, thus mentioned it: &lsquo;As to all those things which have been published under the titles of <span class="t8">Essays, Remarks, Observations</span>, &amp;c. on Shakspeare, if you except some critical notes on <span class="t8">Macbeth</span>, given as a specimen of a projected edition, and written, as appears, by a man of parts and genius, the rest are absolutely below a serious notice.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Of this flattering distinction shewn to him by Warburton, a very grateful remembrance was ever entertained by Johnson, who said, &lsquo;He praised me at a time when praise was of value to me.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">1746: ÆTAT. 37. &mdash; In 1746 it is probable that he was still employed upon his <span class="t8">Shakspeare</span>, which perhaps he laid aside for a time, upon account of the high expectations which were formed of Warburton&rsquo;s edition of that great poet. It is somewhat curious, that his literary career appears to have been almost totally suspended in the years 1745 and 1746, those years which were marked by a civil war in Great-Britain, when a rash attempt was made to restore the House of Stuart to the throne. That he had a tenderness for that unfortunate House, is well known; and some may fancifully imagine, that a sympathetick anxiety impeded the exertion of his intellectual powers: but I am inclined to think, that he was, during this time, sketching the outlines of his great philological work.</p>
<p class="p24">None of his letters during those years are extant, so far as I can discover. This is much to be regretted. It might afford some entertainment to see how he then expressed himself to his private friends, concerning State affairs. Dr. Adams informs me, that &lsquo;at this time a favourite object which he had in contemplation was <span class="t8">The Life of Alfred</span>; in which, from the warmth with which he spoke about it, he would, I believe, had he been master of his own will, have engaged himself, rather than on any other subject.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">1747: ÆTAT. 38. &mdash; In 1747 it is supposed that the <span class="t8">Gentleman&rsquo;s Magazine</span> for May was enriched by him with five short poetical pieces, distinguished by three asterisks. The first is a translation, or rather a paraphrase, of a Latin Epitaph on Sir Thomas Hanmer. Whether the Latin was his, or not, I have never heard, though I should think it probably was, if it be certain that he wrote the English; as to which my only cause of doubt is, that his slighting character of Hanmer as an editor, in his <span class="t8">Observations on Macbeth</span>, is very different from that in the &lsquo;Epitaph.&rsquo; It may be said, that there is the same contrariety between the character in the <span class="t8">Observations</span>, and that in his own Preface to Shakspeare; but a considerable time elapsed between the one publication and the other, whereas the <span class="t8">Observations</span> and the &lsquo;Epitaph&rsquo; came close together. The others are &lsquo;To Miss &mdash;&mdash; , on her giving the Authour a gold and silk net-work Purse of her own weaving;&rsquo; &lsquo;Stella in Mourning;&rsquo; &lsquo;The Winter&rsquo;s Walk;&rsquo; &lsquo;An Ode;&rsquo; and, &lsquo;To Lyce, an elderly Lady.&rsquo; I am not positive that all these were his productions; but as &lsquo;The Winter&rsquo;s Walk&rsquo; has never been controverted to be his, and all of them have the same mark, it is reasonable to conclude that they are all written by the same hand. Yet to the Ode, in which we find a passage very characteristick of him, being a learned description of the gout,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Unhappy, whom to beds of pain <span class="t8">Arthritick</span> tyranny consigns;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">there is the following note: &lsquo;The authour being ill of the gout:&rsquo; but Johnson was not attacked with that distemper till at a very late period of his life. May not this, however, be a poetical fiction? Why may not a poet suppose himself to have the gout, as well as suppose himself to be in love, of which we have innumerable instances, and which has been admirably ridiculed by Johnson in his <span class="t8">Life of Cowley</span>? I have also some difficulty to believe that he could produce such a group of <span class="t8">conceits</span> as appear in the verses to Lyce, in which he claims for this ancient personage as good a right to be assimilated to <span class="t8">heaven</span>, as nymphs whom other poets have flattered; he therefore ironically ascribes to her the attributes of the <span class="t8">sky</span>, in such stanzas as this:</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;Her teeth the <span class="t8">night</span> with <span class="t8">darkness</span> dies,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She&rsquo;s <span class="t8">starr&rsquo;d</span> with pimples o&rsquo;er;<br/>Her tongue like nimble <span class="t8">lightning</span> plies,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And can with <span class="t8">thunder roar</span>.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">But as at a very advanced age he could condescend to trifle in <span class="t8">namby-pamby</span> rhymes, to please Mrs. Thrale and her daughter, he may have, in his earlier years, composed such a piece as this.</p>
<p class="p24">It is remarkable, that in this first edition of <span class="t8">The Winters Walk</span>, the concluding line is much more Johnsonian than it was afterwards printed; for in subsequent editions, after praying Stella to &lsquo;snatch him to her arms,&rsquo; he says,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;And <span class="t8">shield</span> me from the <span class="t8">ills</span> of life.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Whereas in the first edition it is</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;And hide me from the <span class="t8">sight</span> of life.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">A horrour at life in general is more consonant with Johnson&rsquo;s habitual gloomy cast of thought.</p>
<p class="p24">I have heard him repeat with great energy the following verses, which appeared in the <span class="t8">Gentleman&rsquo;s Magazine</span> for April this year; but I have no authority to say they were his own. Indeed one of the best criticks of our age suggests to me, that &lsquo;the word <span class="t8">indifferently</span> being used in the sense of <span class="t8">without concern</span>&rsquo; and being also very unpoetical, renders it improbable that they should have been his composition.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;On Lord LOVAT&rsquo;S <span class="t8">Execution</span>.</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;Pity&rsquo;d by <span class="t8">gentle minds</span> KILMARNOCK died;<br/>The <span class="t8">brave</span>, BALMERINO, were on thy side;<br/>RADCLIFFE, unhappy in his crimes of youth,<br/>Steady in what he still mistook for truth,<br/>Beheld his death so decently unmov&rsquo;d,<br/>The <span class="t8">soft</span> lamented, and the <span class="t8">brave</span> approv&rsquo;d.<br/>But LOVAT&rsquo;S fate indifferently we view,<br/>True to no King, to no <span class="t8">religion</span> true:<br/>No <span class="t8">fair</span> forgets the <span class="t8">ruin</span> he has done;<br/>No <span class="t8">child</span> laments the <span class="t8">tyrant</span> of his <span class="t8">son</span>;<br/>No <span class="t8">tory</span> pities, thinking what he was;<br/>No <span class="t8">whig</span> compassions, <span class="t8">for he left the cause</span>;<br/>The <span class="t8">brave</span> regret not, for he was not brave;<br/>The <span class="t8">honest</span> mourn not, knowing him a knave!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">This year his old pupil and friend, David Garrick, having become joint patentee and manager of Drury-lane theatre, Johnson honoured his opening of it with a Prologue,[*] which for just and manly dramatick criticism, on the whole range of the English stage, as well as for poetical excellence, is unrivalled. Like the celebrated Epilogue to the <span class="t8">Distressed Mother</span>, it was, during the season, often called for by the audience. The most striking and brilliant passages of it have been so often repeated, and are so well recollected by all the lovers of the drama and of poetry, that it would be superfluous to point them out. In the <span class="t8">Gentleman&rsquo;s Magazine</span> for December this year, he inserted an &lsquo;Ode on Winter,&rsquo; which is, I think, an admirable specimen of his genius for lyrick poetry.</p>
<p class="p24">But the year 1747 is distinguished as the epoch, when Johnson&rsquo;s arduous and important work, his DICTIONARY OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE, was announced to the world, by the publication of its Plan or <span class="t8">Prospectus</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">How long this immense undertaking had been the object of his contemplation, I do not know. I once asked him by what means he had attained to that astonishing knowledge of our language, by which he was enabled to realise a design of such extent, and accumulated difficulty. He told me, that &lsquo;it was not the effect of particular study; but that it had grown up in his mind insensibly.&rsquo; I have been informed by Mr. James Dodsley, that several years before this period, when Johnson was one day sitting in his brother Robert&rsquo;s shop, he heard his brother suggest to him, that a Dictionary of the English Language would be a work that would be well received by the publick; that Johnson seemed at first to catch at the proposition, but, after a pause, said, in his abrupt decisive manner, &lsquo;I believe I shall not undertake it.&rsquo; That he, however, had bestowed much thought upon the subject, before he published his <span class="t8">Plan</span>, is evident from the enlarged, clear, and accurate views which it exhibits; and we find him mentioning in that tract, that many of the writers whose testimonies were to be produced as authorities, were selected by Pope; which proves that he had been furnished, probably by Mr. Robert Dodsley, with whatever hints that eminent poet had contributed towards a great literary project, that had been the subject of important consideration in a former reign.</p>
