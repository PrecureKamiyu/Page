<h2 class="h20"><a id="a906"></a>ULVA</h2>
<p class="p21">While we stood deliberating, we were happily espied from an Irish ship, that lay at anchor in the strait.&nbsp; The master saw that we wanted a passage, and with great civility sent us his boat, which quickly conveyed us to Ulva, where we were very liberally entertained by Mr. Macquarry.</p>
<p class="p24">To Ulva we came in the dark, and left it before noon the next day.&nbsp; A very exact description therefore will not be expected.&nbsp; We were told, that it is an Island of no great extent, rough and barren, inhabited by the Macquarrys; a clan not powerful nor numerous, but of antiquity, which most other families are content to reverence.&nbsp; The name is supposed to be a depravation of some other; for the Earse language does not afford it any etymology.&nbsp; Macquarry is proprietor both of Ulva and some adjacent Islands, among which is Staffa, so lately raised to renown by Mr. Banks.</p>
<p class="p24">When the Islanders were reproached with their ignorance, or insensibility of the wonders of Staffa, they had not much to reply.&nbsp; They had indeed considered it little, because they had always seen it; and none but philosophers, nor they always, are struck with wonder, otherwise than by novelty.&nbsp; How would it surprise an unenlightened ploughman, to hear a company of sober men, inquiring by what power the hand tosses a stone, or why the stone, when it is tossed, falls to the ground!</p>
<p class="p24">Of the ancestors of Macquarry, who thus lies hid in his unfrequented Island, I have found memorials in all places where they could be expected.</p>
<p class="p24">Inquiring after the reliques of former manners, I found that in Ulva, and, I think, no where else, is continued the payment of the Mercheta Mulierum; a fine in old times due to the Laird at the marriage of a virgin.&nbsp; The original of this claim, as of our tenure of Borough English, is variously delivered.&nbsp; It is pleasant to find ancient customs in old families.&nbsp; This payment, like others, was, for want of money, made anciently in the produce of the land.&nbsp; Macquarry was used to demand a sheep, for which he now takes a crown, by that inattention to the uncertain proportion between the value and the denomination of money, which has brought much disorder into Europe.&nbsp; A sheep has always the same power of supplying human wants, but a crown will bring at one time more, at another less.</p>
<p class="p24">Ulva was not neglected by the piety of ardent times: it has still to show what was once a church.</p>
