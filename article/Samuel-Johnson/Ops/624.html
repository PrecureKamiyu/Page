<p class="p21">Has two sounds; long, as <span class="t8">scêne</span>, and short, as <span class="t8">men.</span> <span class="t8">E</span> is the most frequent vowel in the English language; for it not only is used like the rest in the beginning or end of words, but has the peculiar quality of lengthening the foregoing vowel, as <span class="t8">căn, cāne; măn, māne; găp, gāpe; glăd, glāde; brĕd, brēde; chĭn, chīne; whĭp, wīpe; thĭn, thīne; nŏd, nōde; tŭn, tūne; plŭm, plūme.</span> Yet it sometimes occurs final, where yet the foregoing vowel is not lengthened; as <span class="t8">gŏne, knowlĕdge, gĭve</span>. Anciently almost every word ended with <span class="t8">e</span>; as for <span class="t8">can, canne;</span> for <span class="t8">year, yeare</span>; for <span class="t8">great, greate</span>; for <span class="t8">need, neede</span>; for <span class="t8">flock, flocke</span>. It is probable that this <span class="t8">e</span> final had at first a soft sound, like the female <span class="t8">e</span> of the French; and that afterwards it was in poetry either mute or vocal, as the verse required, &lsquo;till at last it became universally silent.</p>
<p class="p32"><span class="t8">Ea</span> has the sound of <span class="t8">e</span> long: the <span class="t8">e</span> is commonly lengthened rather by the immediate addition of <span class="t8">a</span> than by the apposition of <span class="t8">e</span> to the end of the word; as <span class="t8">mĕn, mēan; fĕll, fēal; mĕt, mēat; nĕt, nēat.</span></p>

<p class="p32">1. A bird of prey, which, as it is reported, renews its age when it grows old. But some think that this recovery of youth happens no otherwise in the eagle than in other birds, by casting their feathers every year in the moulting season, and having others in their room. It is also said not to drink at all, like other birds with sharp claws. It is given out, that when an eagle sees its young so well grown as to venture upon flying, it hovers over their nest, flutters with its wings, and excites them to imitate it, and take their flight; and when it sees them weary, or fearful, it takes and carries them upon its back. Eagles are said to be extremely sharp-sighted, and, when they take flight, spring perpendicularly upward, with their eyes steadily fixed upon the sun, mounting &lsquo;till, by their distance, they disappear. <span class="t8">Calmet.</span></p>
