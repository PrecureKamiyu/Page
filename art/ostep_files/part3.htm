As you may have noticed, they are free and available on-line from the following web page:</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.ostep.org/" class="s14">http://www.ostep.org</a></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">You can also purchase a printed copy from <span class="s15">lulu.com</span>. Look for it on the web page above.</p><p class="s5" style="padding-left: 52pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">The (current) proper citation for the book is as follows:</p><p class="s9" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: left;">Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces</p><p class="s5" style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Remzi H. Arpaci-Dusseau and Andrea C. Arpaci-Dusseau Arpaci-Dusseau Books, Inc.</p><p class="s5" style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">May, 2014 (Version 0.8)</p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.ostep.org/" class="s14">http://www.ostep.org</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s5" style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 11pt;text-align: justify;">The course divides fairly well across a 15-week semester, in which you can cover most of the topics within at a reasonable level of depth. Cramming the course into a 10-week quarter probably requires dropping some detail from each of the pieces. There are also a few chapters on virtual machine monitors, which we usually squeeze in sometime during the semester, either right at end of the large section on virtualization, or near the end as an aside.</p><p class="s5" style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 11pt;text-align: justify;">One slightly unusual aspect of the book is that concurrency, a topic at the front of many OS books, is pushed off herein until the student has built an understand- ing of virtualization of the CPU and of memory. In our experience in teaching this course for nearly 15 years, students have a hard time understanding how the concurrency problem arises, or why they are trying to solve it, if they don’t yet un- derstand what an address space is, what a process is, or why context switches can occur at arbitrary points in time. Once they do understand these concepts, how- ever, introducing the notion of threads and the problems that arise due to them becomes rather easy, or at least, easier.</p><p class="s5" style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 11pt;text-align: right;">You may have noticed there are no slides that go hand-in-hand with the book. The major reason for this omission is that we believe in the most old-fashioned of teaching methods: chalk and a blackboard. Thus, when we teach the course, we come to class with a few major ideas and examples in mind and use the board to present them; handouts and live code demos sprinkled are also useful. In our experience, using too many slides encourages students to “check out” of lecture (and log into facebook.com), as they know the material is there for them to digest later; using the blackboard makes lecture a “live” viewing experience and thus (hopefully) more interactive, dynamic, and enjoyable for the students in your class.</p><p class="s5" style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 11pt;text-align: justify;">If you’d like a copy of the notes we use in preparation for class, please drop us an email. We have already shared them with many others around the world.</p><p class="s5" style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 11pt;text-align: justify;">One last request: if you use the free online chapters, please just <b>link </b>to them, instead of making a local copy. This helps us track usage (over 1 million chapters downloaded in the past few years!) and also ensures students get the latest and greatest version.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part2.htm">&lt; 上一个</a><span> | </span><a href="../ostep.html">内容</a><span> | </span><a href="part4.htm">下一个 &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
