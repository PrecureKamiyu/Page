<p id="P70010119520000000000000000098EE" data-uri="M01_KURO4140_07_SE_C01.xhtml#P70010119520000000000000000098EE">The Internet has become mission critical for many institutions today, including large and small companies, universities, and government agencies. Many individuals also rely on the Internet for many of their professional, social, and personal activities. Billions of “things,” including wearables and home devices, are currently being connected to the Internet. But behind all this utility and excitement, there is a dark side, a side where “bad guys” attempt to wreak havoc in our daily lives by damaging our Internet-connected computers, violating our privacy, and rendering inoperable the Internet services on which we depend.</p>
<p id="P70010119520000000000000000098EF" data-uri="M01_KURO4140_07_SE_C01.xhtml#P70010119520000000000000000098EF">The field of network security is about how the bad guys can attack computer networks and about how we, soon-to-be experts in computer networking, can defend networks against those attacks, or better yet, design new architectures that are immune to such attacks in the first place. Given the frequency and variety of existing attacks as well as the threat of new and more destructive future attacks, network security has become a central topic in the field of computer networking. One of the features of this textbook is that it brings network security issues to the forefront.</p>
<p id="P70010119520000000000000000098F0" data-uri="M01_KURO4140_07_SE_C01.xhtml#P70010119520000000000000000098F0">Since we don’t yet have expertise in computer networking and Internet protocols, we’ll begin here by surveying some of today’s more prevalent security-related problems. This will whet our appetite for more substantial discussions in the upcoming chapters. So we begin here by simply asking, what can go wrong? How are computer networks vulnerable? What are some of the more prevalent types of attacks today?</p>

The classic example is an e-mail attachment containing malicious executable code. If a user receives and opens such an attachment, the user inadvertently runs the malware on the device. Typically, such e-mail viruses are self-replicating: once executed, the virus may send an identical message with an identical malicious attachment to, for example, every recipient in the user’s address book. <span class="keyword" id="P700101195200000000000000000072B" data-uri="M01_KURO4140_07_SE_C01.xhtml#P700101195200000000000000000072B"><b>Worms</b></span> are malware that can enter a device without any explicit user interaction. For example, a user may be running a vulnerable network application to which an attacker can send malware. In some cases, without any user intervention, the application may accept the malware from the Internet and run it, creating a worm. The worm in the newly infected device then scans the Internet, searching for other hosts running the same vulnerable network application. When it finds other vulnerable hosts, it sends a copy of itself to those hosts. Today, malware, is pervasive and costly to defend against. As you work through this textbook, we encourage you to think about the following question: What can computer network designers do to defend Internet-attached devices from malware attacks?</p>

Imagine the unsuspecting receiver (say an Internet router) who receives such a packet, takes the (false) source address as being truthful, and then performs some command embedded in the packet’s contents (say modifies its forwarding table). The ability to inject packets into the Internet with a false source address is known as <span class="keyword" id="P700101195200000000000000000074C" data-uri="M01_KURO4140_07_SE_C01.xhtml#P700101195200000000000000000074C"><b>IP spoofing</b></span>, and is but one of many ways in which one user can masquerade as another user.</p>

Once again, we encourage you to think about how this can be done for network applications and protocols as you progress through the chapters of this book.

The answer, in essence, is that the Internet was originally designed to be that way, based on the model of “a group of mutually trusting users attached to a transparent network” <a class="biblioref" href="fileP70010119520000000000000000037E0.xhtml#P7001011952000000000000000003845" data-foobar="7">[Blumenthal 2001]</a>—a model in which (by definition) there is no need for security. Many aspects of the original Internet architecture deeply reflect this notion of mutual trust. For example, the ability for one user to send a packet to any other user is the default rather than a requested/granted capability, and user identity is taken at declared face value, rather than being authenticated by default.</p>
<p id="P700101195200000000000000000990C" data-uri="M01_KURO4140_07_SE_C01.xhtml#P700101195200000000000000000990C">But today’s Internet certainly does not involve “mutually trusting users.” Nonetheless, today’s users still need to communicate when they don’t necessarily trust each other, may wish to communicate anonymously, may communicate indirectly through third parties (e.g., Web caches, which we’ll study in <a class="xref" href="fileP700101195200000000000000000096B.xhtml#P700101195200000000000000000096B" data-foobar="7"><span class="label">Chapter</span> <span class="number">2</span></a>, or mobility-assisting agents, which we’ll study in <a class="xref" href="fileP70010119520000000000000000028C7.xhtml#P70010119520000000000000000028C7" data-foobar="7"><span class="label">Chapter</span> <span class="number">7</span></a>), and may distrust the hardware, software, and even the air through which they communicate. We now have many security-related challenges before us as we progress through this book: We should seek defenses against sniffing, end-point masquerading, man-in-the-middle attacks, DDoS attacks, malware, and more. We should keep in mind that communication among mutually trusted users is the exception rather than the rule. Welcome to the world of modern computer networking!</p>
