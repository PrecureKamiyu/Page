<p class="p21">The original working title of this novella was &lsquo;The Choice of Life&rsquo;, which according to legend Johnson wrote in only one week to help pay the costs of his mother&rsquo;s funeral. The book was first published in April 1759 and it is believed the author received a total of Â£75 for the copyright. The title page of this edition carried a quotation, inserted by the publisher Robert Bell, from La Rochefoucauld: &ldquo;The labour or Exercise of the Body, freeth Man from the Pains of the Mind; and this constitutes the Happiness of the Poor&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="p22">In composing the narrative, Johnson was influenced by the vogue for exotic locations. Previously, he had translated <span class="t8">A Voyage to Abyssinia</span> by Jeronimo Lobo and used it as the basis for what was described as a &ldquo;philosophical romance&rdquo;. Early readers considered the novella to be a work of philosophical and practical importance and critics often remarked on the difficulty of classifying it as a piece of simple narrative fiction. Johnson was a staunch opponent of slavery and greatly revered by abolitionists, and in time Rasselas would become a name adopted by emancipated slaves.</p>
<p class="p22">The story is thematically similar to <span class="t8">Candide</span> by Voltaire which was published earlier the same year, as both novellas concern young men travelling in the company of honoured teachers, encountering and examining human suffering in an attempt to determine the root of happiness.&nbsp; Nevertheless, their root concerns are distinctly different. Voltaire was directly satirising the widely-read philosophical work by Gottfried Leibniz, particularly the <span class="t8">Theodicee</span>, in which Leibniz asserts that the world, no matter how we may perceive it, is necessarily the &ldquo;best of all possible worlds&rdquo;. In contrast the question Rasselas confronts most directly is whether or not humanity is essentially capable of attaining happiness. Writing as a devout Christian, Johnson makes no targeted attack on religion, as Voltaire does, and while the story is in places light and humorous, it is not a piece of satire, as indeed <span class="t8">Candide </span>certainly is.</p>
<p class="p22">In Johnson&rsquo;s narrative, Rasselas, son of the King of Abyssinia, modern-day Ethiopia, is forced to remain in a beautiful valley until the order of succession should make him King. He grows weary of the factitious entertainments of the place and after much brooding, he escapes with his sister Nekayah, her attendant Pekuah and his poet-friend Imlac. They set off to see the world and search for happiness, but after a sojourn in Egypt, where they encounter various classes of society and undergo various adventures, they perceive the futility of their search and abruptly return to Abyssinia.</p>
