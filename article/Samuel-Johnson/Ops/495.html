<h2 class="h20"><a id="a1091"></a><a id="a1092"></a>A GRAMMAR OF THE ENGLISH TONGUE</h2>
<p class="p27"><span class="t4">Grammar</span>, which is the <span class="t8">art of using words properly</span>, comprises four parts: Orthography, Etymology, Syntax, and Prosody.</p>
<p class="p24">In this division and order of the parts of grammar I follow the common grammarians, without inquiring whether a fitter distribution might not be found. Experience has long shown this method to be so distinct as to obviate confusion, and so comprehensive as to prevent any inconvenient omissions. I likewise use the terms already received, and already understood, though perhaps others more proper might sometimes be invented. Sylburgius, and other innovators, whose new terms have sunk their learning into neglect, have left sufficient warning against the trifling ambition of teaching arts in a new language.</p>
<p class="p27"><span class="t4">Orthography</span> is <span class="t8">the art of combining letters into syllables, and syllables into words</span>. It therefore teaches previously the form and sound of letters.</p>
<p class="p30">The letters of the English language are,</p>

<p class="p1">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p24">To these may be added certain combinations of letters universally used in printing; as, <span class="t8">fl</span>, <span class="t8">ff</span>, <span class="t8">fi</span>, <span class="t8">ffi</span>, <span class="t8">ffl</span>, and <span class="t8">&amp;</span>, or <span class="t8">and per se, and</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">Our letters are commonly reckoned twenty-four, because anciently <span class="t8">i</span> and <span class="t8">j</span> as well as <span class="t8">u</span> and <span class="t8">v</span> were expressed by the same character; but as those letters, which had always different powers, have now different forms, our alphabet may be properly said to consist of twenty-six letters</p>
<p class="p24">Vowels are five, <span class="t8">a</span>, <span class="t8">e</span>, <span class="t8">i</span>, <span class="t8">o</span>, <span class="t8">u</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">Such is the number generally received; but for <span class="t8">i</span> it is the practice to write <span class="t8">y</span> in the end of words, as <span class="t8">thy</span>, <span class="t8">holy</span>; before <span class="t8">i</span>, as from <span class="t8">die</span>, <span class="t8">dying</span>; from <span class="t8">beautify</span>, <span class="t8">beautifying</span>; in the words <span class="t8">says</span>, <span class="t8">days</span>, <span class="t8">eyes</span>; and in words derived from the Greek, and written originally with υ, as <span class="t8">sympathy</span>, συμπαθεια, <span class="t8">system</span>, συστημα.</p>
<p class="p24">For <span class="t8">u</span> we often write <span class="t8">w</span> after a vowel, to make a diphthong; as, <span class="t8">raw</span>, <span class="t8">grew</span>, <span class="t8">view</span>, <span class="t8">vow</span>, <span class="t8">flowing</span>; <span class="t8">lowness</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">The sounds of all the letters are various.</p>
<p class="p24">In treating on the letters, I shall not, like some other grammarians, inquire into the original of their form, as an antiquarian; nor into their formation and prolation by the organs of speech, as a mechanick, anatomist, or physiologist; nor into the properties and gradation of sounds, or the elegance or harshness of particular combinations, as a writer of universal and transcendental grammar. I consider the English alphabet only as it is English; and even in this narrow disquisition I follow the example of former grammarians, perhaps with more reverence than judgment, because by writing in English I suppose my reader already acquainted with the English language, and consequently able to pronounce the letters of which I teach the pronunciation; and because of sounds in general it may be observed, that words are unable to describe them. An account, therefore, of the primitive and simple letters, is useless, almost alike to those who know their sound, and those who know it not.</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">OF VOWELS</span></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">A.</span></p>
<p class="p21"><span class="t8">A</span> has three sounds, the slender, open, and broad.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">A</span> slender is found in most words, as <span class="t8">face</span>, <span class="t8">mane</span>, and in words ending in <span class="t8">ation</span>, as <span class="t8">creation</span>, <span class="t8">salvation</span>, <span class="t8">generation</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">The <span class="t8">a</span> slender is the proper English <span class="t8">a</span>, called very justly by Erpenius, in his Arabick Grammar, <span class="t8">a Anglicum cum e mistum</span>, as having a middle sound between the open <span class="t8">a</span> and the <span class="t8">e</span>. The French have a similar sound in the word <span class="t8">pais</span>, and in their <span class="t8">e</span> masculine.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">A</span> open is the <span class="t8">a</span> of the Italian, or nearly resembles it; as <span class="t8">father</span>, <span class="t8">rather</span>, <span class="t8">congratulate</span>, <span class="t8">fancy</span>, <span class="t8">glass</span>.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">A</span> broad resembles the <span class="t8">a</span> of the German; as <span class="t8">all</span>, <span class="t8">wall</span>, <span class="t8">call</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">Many words pronounced with <span class="t8">a</span> broad were anciently written with <span class="t8">au</span>; as <span class="t8">sault</span>, <span class="t8">mault</span>; and we still say, <span class="t8">fault</span>, <span class="t8">vault</span>. This was probably the Saxon sound, for it is yet retained in the northern dialects, and in the rustick pronunciation; as <span class="t8">maun</span> for <span class="t8">man</span>, <span class="t8">haund</span> for <span class="t8">hand</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">The short <span class="t8">a</span> approaches to the <span class="t8">a</span> open, as <span class="t8">grass</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">The long <span class="t8">a</span>, if prolonged by <span class="t8">e</span> at the end of the word, is always slender, as <span class="t8">graze</span>, <span class="t8">fame</span>.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">A</span> forms a diphthong only with <span class="t8">i</span> or <span class="t8">y</span>, and <span class="t8">u</span> or <span class="t8">w</span>. <span class="t8">Ai</span> or <span class="t8">ay</span>, as in <span class="t8">plain</span>, <span class="t8">wain</span>, <span class="t8">gay</span>, <span class="t8">clay</span>, has only the sound of the long and slender <span class="t8">a</span>, and differs not in the pronunciation from <span class="t8">plane</span>, <span class="t8">wane</span>.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Au</span> or <span class="t8">aw</span> has the sound of the German a, as <span class="t8">raw</span>, <span class="t8">naughty</span>.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Ae</span> is sometimes found in Latin words not completely naturalized or assimilated, but is no English diphthong; and is more properly expressed by single <span class="t8">e</span>, as <span class="t8">Cesar</span>, <span class="t8">Eneas</span>.</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">E.</span></p>
<p class="p21"><span class="t8">E</span> is the letter which occurs most frequently in the English language.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">E</span> is long, as in scēne; or short, as in <span class="t8">cĕllar</span>, <span class="t8">sĕparate</span>, <span class="t8">cĕlebrate</span>, <span class="t8">mĕn</span>, <span class="t8">thĕn</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">It is always short before a double consonant, or two consonants, as in <span class="t8">vĕx</span>, <span class="t8">pĕrplexity</span>, <span class="t8">relĕnt</span>, <span class="t8">mĕdlar</span>, <span class="t8">rĕptile</span>, <span class="t8">sĕrpent</span>, <span class="t8">cĕllar</span>, <span class="t8">cĕssation</span>, <span class="t8">blĕssing</span>, <span class="t8">fĕll</span>, <span class="t8">fĕlling</span>, <span class="t8">dĕbt</span>.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">E</span> is always mute at the end of a word, except in monosyllables that have no other vowel, as <span class="t8">the</span>; or proper names, as <span class="t8">Penelope</span>, <span class="t8">Phebe</span>, <span class="t8">Derbe</span>; being used to modify the foregoing consonants, as <span class="t8">since</span>, <span class="t8">once</span>, <span class="t8">hedge</span>, <span class="t8">oblige</span>; or to lengthen the preceding vowel, as <span class="t8">băn</span>, <span class="t8">bāne</span>; <span class="t8">căn</span>, <span class="t8">cāne</span>; <span class="t8">pĭn</span>, <span class="t8">pīne</span>; <span class="t8">tŭn</span>, <span class="t8">tūne</span>; <span class="t8">rŭb</span>, <span class="t8">rūbe</span>; <span class="t8">pŏp</span>, <span class="t8">pōpe</span>; <span class="t8">fĭr</span>, <span class="t8">fīre</span>; <span class="t8">cŭr</span>, <span class="t8">cūre</span>; <span class="t8">tŭb</span>, <span class="t8">tūbe</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">Almost all words which now terminate in consonants ended anciently in <span class="t8">e</span>, as <span class="t8">year</span>, <span class="t8">yeare</span>; <span class="t8">wildness</span>, <span class="t8">wildnesse</span>; which <span class="t8">e</span> probably had the force of the French <span class="t8">e</span> feminine, and constituted a syllable with its associate consonant; for in old editions words are sometimes divided thus, <span class="t8">clea-re</span>, <span class="t8">fel-le</span>, <span class="t8">knowled-ge</span>. This <span class="t8">e</span> was perhaps for a time vocal or silent in poetry as convenience required; but it has been long wholly mute. Camden in his <span class="t8">Remains</span> calls it the silent <span class="t8">e</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">It does not always lengthen the foregoing vowel, as <span class="t8">glŏve</span>, <span class="t8">lĭve</span>, <span class="t8">gĭve</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">It has sometimes in the end of words a sound obscure, and scarcely perceptible, as <span class="t8">open</span>, <span class="t8">shapen</span>, <span class="t8">shotten</span>, <span class="t8">thistle</span>, <span class="t8">participle</span>, <span class="t8">metre</span>, <span class="t8">lucre</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">This faintness of sound is found when <span class="t8">e</span> separates a mute from a liquid, as in <span class="t8">rotten</span>, or follows a mute and liquid, as in <span class="t8">cattle</span>.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">E</span> forms a diphthong with <span class="t8">a</span>, as <span class="t8">near</span>; with <span class="t8">i</span>, as <span class="t8">deign</span>, <span class="t8">receive</span>; and with <span class="t8">u</span> or <span class="t8">w</span>, as <span class="t8">new</span>, <span class="t8">stew</span>.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Ea</span> sounds like <span class="t8">e</span> long, as <span class="t8">mean</span>; or like <span class="t8">ee</span>, as <span class="t8">dear</span>, <span class="t8">clear</span>, <span class="t8">near</span>.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Ei</span> is sounded like <span class="t8">e</span> long, as <span class="t8">seize</span>, <span class="t8">perceiving</span>.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Eu</span> sounds as <span class="t8">u</span> long and soft.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">E</span>, <span class="t8">a</span>, <span class="t8">u</span>, are combined in <span class="t8">beauty</span> and its derivatives, but have only the sound of <span class="t8">u</span>.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">E</span> may be said to form a diphthong by reduplication, as <span class="t8">agree</span>, <span class="t8">sleeping</span>.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Eo</span> is found in <span class="t8">yeoman</span>, where it is sounded as <span class="t8">o</span> short; and in <span class="t8">people</span>, where it is pronounced like <span class="t8">ee</span>.</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">I.</span></p>
<p class="p21"><span class="t8">I</span> has a sound long, as <span class="t8">fīne</span>; and short as <span class="t8">fĭn</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">That is eminently observable in <span class="t8">i</span>, which may be likewise remarkable in other letters, that the short sound is not the long sound contracted, but a sound wholly different.</p>
<p class="p24">The long sound in monosyllables is always marked by the <span class="t8">e</span> final, as <span class="t8">thĭn</span>, <span class="t8">thīne</span>.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">I</span> is often sounded before <span class="t8">r</span>, as a short <span class="t8">u</span>; as <span class="t8">flirt</span>, <span class="t8">first</span>, <span class="t8">shirt</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">It forms a diphthong only with <span class="t8">e</span>, as <span class="t8">field</span>, <span class="t8">shield</span>, which is sounded as the double <span class="t8">ee</span>; except <span class="t8">friend</span>, which is sounded as <span class="t8">frĕnd</span>.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">I</span> is joined with <span class="t8">eu</span> in <span class="t8">lieu</span>, and <span class="t8">ew</span> in <span class="t8">view</span>; which triphthongs are sounded as the open <span class="t8">u</span>.</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">O.</span></p>
<p class="p21"><span class="t8">O</span> is long, as <span class="t8">bōne</span>, <span class="t8">ōbedient</span>, <span class="t8">corrōding</span>; or short, as <span class="t8">blŏck</span>, <span class="t8">knŏck</span>, <span class="t8">ŏblique</span>, <span class="t8">lŏll</span>.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Women</span> is pronounced <span class="t8">wimen</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">The short o has sometimes the sound of close <span class="t8">u</span>, as <span class="t8">son</span>, <span class="t8">come</span>.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">O</span> coalesces into a diphthong with <span class="t8">a</span>, as <span class="t8">moan</span>, <span class="t8">groan</span>, <span class="t8">approach</span>: <span class="t8">oa</span> has the sound of <span class="t8">o</span> long.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">O</span> is united to <span class="t8">e</span> in some words derived from Greek, as <span class="t8">œconomy</span>; but as being not an English diphthong, they are better written as they are sounded, with only <span class="t8">e</span>, <span class="t8">economy</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">With <span class="t8">i</span>, as <span class="t8">oil</span>, <span class="t8">soil</span>, <span class="t8">moil</span>, <span class="t8">noisome</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">This coalition of letters seems to unite the sounds of the two letters, as far as two sounds can be united without being destroyed, and therefore approaches more nearly than any combination in our tongue to the notion of a diphthong.</p>
<p class="p24">With <span class="t8">o</span>, as <span class="t8">boot</span>, <span class="t8">hoot</span>, <span class="t8">cooler</span>; <span class="t8">oo</span> has the sound of the Italian <span class="t8">u</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">With <span class="t8">u</span> or <span class="t8">w</span>, as <span class="t8">our</span>, <span class="t8">power</span>, <span class="t8">flower</span>; but in some words has only the sound of <span class="t8">o</span> long, as in <span class="t8">soul</span>, <span class="t8">bowl</span>, <span class="t8">sow</span>, <span class="t8">grow</span>. These different sounds are used to distinguish different significations: as <span class="t8">bow</span> an instrument for shooting; <span class="t8">bow</span>, a depression of the head; <span class="t8">sow</span>, the she of a boar; <span class="t8">sow</span>, to scatter seed; <span class="t8">bowl</span>, an orbicular body; <span class="t8">bowl</span>, a wooden vessel.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Ou</span> is sometimes pronounced like <span class="t8">o</span> soft, as <span class="t8">court</span>; sometimes like <span class="t8">o</span> short, as <span class="t8">cough</span>; sometimes like <span class="t8">u</span> close, as <span class="t8">could</span>; or <span class="t8">u</span> open, as <span class="t8">rough</span>, <span class="t8">tough</span>, which use only can teach.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Ou</span> is frequently used in the last syllable of words which in Latin end in <span class="t8">or</span> and are made English, as <span class="t8">honour</span>, <span class="t8">labour</span>, <span class="t8">favour</span>, from <span class="t8">honor</span>, <span class="t8">labor</span>, <span class="t8">favor</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">Some late innovators have ejected the <span class="t8">u</span>, without considering that the last syllable gives the sound neither of <span class="t8">or</span> nor <span class="t8">ur</span>, but a sound between them, if not compounded of both; besides that they are probably derived to us from the French nouns in <span class="t8">eur</span>, as <span class="t8">honeur</span>, <span class="t8">faveur</span><a id="a1093"></a>.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">U.</span></p>
<p class="p21">U is long in <span class="t8">ūse</span>, <span class="t8">confūsion</span>; or short, as <span class="t8">ŭs</span>, <span class="t8">concŭssion</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">It coalesces with <span class="t8">a</span>, <span class="t8">e</span>, <span class="t8">i</span>, <span class="t8">o</span>; but has rather in these combinations the force of the <span class="t8">w</span> consonant, as <span class="t8">quaff</span>, <span class="t8">quest</span>, <span class="t8">quit</span>, <span class="t8">quite</span>, <span class="t8">languish</span>; sometimes in <span class="t8">ui</span> the <span class="t8">i</span> loses its sound, as in <span class="t8">juice</span>. It is sometimes mute before <span class="t8">a</span>, <span class="t8">e</span>, <span class="t8">i</span>, <span class="t8">y</span>, as <span class="t8">guard</span>, <span class="t8">guest</span>, <span class="t8">guise</span>, <span class="t8">buy</span>.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">U</span> is followed by <span class="t8">e</span> in <span class="t8">virtue</span>, but the <span class="t8">e</span> has no sound.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Ue</span> is sometimes mute at the end of a word, in imitation of the French, as <span class="t8">prorogue</span>, <span class="t8">synagogue</span>, <span class="t8">plague</span>, <span class="t8">vague</span>, <span class="t8">harangue</span>.</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">Y.</span></p>
<p class="p21"><span class="t8">Y</span> is a vowel, which, as Quintilian observes of one of the Roman letters, we might want without inconvenience, but that we have it. It supplies the place of <span class="t8">i</span> at the end of words, as <span class="t8">thy</span>, before an <span class="t8">i</span>, as <span class="t8">dying</span>; and is commonly retained in derivative words where it was part of a diphthong, in the primitive; as, <span class="t8">destroy</span>, <span class="t8">destroyer</span>; <span class="t8">betray</span>, <span class="t8">betrayed</span>, <span class="t8">betrayer</span>; <span class="t8">pray</span>, <span class="t8">prayer</span>; <span class="t8">say</span>, <span class="t8">sayer</span>; <span class="t8">day</span>, <span class="t8">days</span>.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Y</span> being the Saxon vowel <span class="t8">y</span>, which was commonly used where <span class="t8">i</span> is now put, occurs very frequently in all old books.</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">GENERAL RULES.</span></p>
<p class="p21">A vowel in the beginning or middle syllable, before two consonants, is commonly short, as <span class="t8">ŏppŏrtunity</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">In monosyllables a single vowel before a single consonant is short; as <span class="t8">stag</span>, <span class="t8">frog</span>.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Many</span> is pronounced as if it were written <span class="t8">manny</span>.</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">OF CONSONANTS.</span></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">B.</span></p>
<p class="p21"><span class="t8">B</span> has one unvaried sound, such as it obtains in other languages.</p>
<p class="p24">It is mute in <span class="t8">debt</span>, <span class="t8">debtor</span>, <span class="t8">subtle</span>, <span class="t8">doubt</span>, <span class="t8">lamb</span>, <span class="t8">limb</span>, <span class="t8">dumb</span>, <span class="t8">thumb</span>, <span class="t8">climb</span>, <span class="t8">comb</span>, <span class="t8">womb</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">It is used before <span class="t8">l</span> and <span class="t8">r</span>, as <span class="t8">black</span>, <span class="t8">brown</span>.</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">C.</span></p>
<p class="p21"><span class="t8">C</span> has before <span class="t8">e</span> and <span class="t8">i</span> the sound of <span class="t8">s</span>; as <span class="t8">sincerely</span>, <span class="t8">centrick</span>, <span class="t8">century</span>, <span class="t8">circular</span>, <span class="t8">cistern</span>, <span class="t8">city</span>, <span class="t8">siccity</span>: before <span class="t8">a</span>, <span class="t8">o</span>, and <span class="t8">u</span>, it sounds like <span class="t8">k</span>, as <span class="t8">calm</span>, <span class="t8">concavity</span>, <span class="t8">copper</span>, <span class="t8">incorporate</span>, <span class="t8">curiosity</span>, <span class="t8">concupiscence</span>.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">C</span> might be omitted in the language without loss, since one of its sounds might be supplied by, <span class="t8">s</span>, and the other by <span class="t8">k</span>, but that it preserves to the eye the etymology of words, as <span class="t8">face</span> from <span class="t8">facies</span>, <span class="t8">captive</span> from <span class="t8">captivus</span>.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Ch</span> has a sound which is analyzed into <span class="t8">tsh</span>, as <span class="t8">church</span>, <span class="t8">chin</span>, <span class="t8">crutch</span>. It is the same sound which the Italians give to the <span class="t8">c</span> simple before <span class="t8">i</span> and <span class="t8">e</span>, as <span class="t8">citta</span>, <span class="t8">cerro</span>.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Ch</span> is sounded like <span class="t8">k</span> in words derived from the Greek, as <span class="t8">chymist</span>, <span class="t8">scheme</span>, <span class="t8">choler</span>. <span class="t8">Arch</span> is commonly sounded <span class="t8">ark</span> before a vowel, as <span class="t8">archangel</span>, and with the English sound of <span class="t8">ch</span> before a consonant, as <span class="t8">archbishop</span>.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Ch</span>, in some French words not yet assimilated, sounds like <span class="t8">sh</span>, as <span class="t8">machine</span>, <span class="t8">chaise</span>.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">C</span>, according to English orthography, never ends a word; therefore we write <span class="t8">stick</span>, <span class="t8">block</span>, which were originally, <span class="t8">sticke</span>, <span class="t8">blocke</span>. In such words <span class="t8">c</span> is now mute.</p>
<p class="p24">It is used before <span class="t8">l</span> and <span class="t8">r</span>, as <span class="t8">clock</span>, <span class="t8">cross</span>.</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">D.</span></p>
<p class="p21">Is uniform in its sound, as <span class="t8">death</span>, <span class="t8">diligent</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">It is used before <span class="t8">r</span>, as <span class="t8">draw</span>, <span class="t8">dross</span>; and <span class="t8">w</span> as <span class="t8">dwell</span>.</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">F.</span></p>
<p class="p21"><span class="t8">F</span>, though having a name beginning with a vowel, is numbered by the grammarians among the semivowels, yet has this quality of a mute, that it is commodiously sounded before a liquid, as <span class="t8">flask</span>, <span class="t8">fry</span>, <span class="t8">freckle</span>. It has an unvariable sound, except that <span class="t8">of</span> is sometimes spoken nearly as <span class="t8">ov</span>.</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">G.</span></p>
<p class="p21"><span class="t8">G</span> has two sounds; one hard, as in <span class="t8">gay</span>, <span class="t8">go</span>, <span class="t8">gun</span>; the other soft, as in <span class="t8">gem</span>, <span class="t8">giant</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">At the end of a word it is always hard, as <span class="t8">ring</span>, <span class="t8">snug</span>, <span class="t8">song</span>, <span class="t8">frog</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">Before <span class="t8">e</span> and <span class="t8">i</span> the sound is uncertain.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">G</span> before <span class="t8">e</span> is soft, as <span class="t8">gem</span>, <span class="t8">generation</span>, except in <span class="t8">gear</span>, <span class="t8">geld</span>, <span class="t8">geese</span>, <span class="t8">get</span>, <span class="t8">gewgaw</span>, and derivatives from words ending in <span class="t8">g</span>, as <span class="t8">singing</span>, <span class="t8">stronger</span>, and generally before <span class="t8">er</span> at the ends of words, as <span class="t8">finger</span>.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">G</span> is mute before <span class="t8">n</span>, as <span class="t8">gnash</span>, <span class="t8">sign</span>, <span class="t8">foreign</span>.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">G</span> before <span class="t8">i</span> is hard, as <span class="t8">give</span>, except in <span class="t8">giant</span>, <span class="t8">gigantick</span>, <span class="t8">gibbet</span>, <span class="t8">gibe</span>, <span class="t8">giblets</span>, <span class="t8">Giles</span>, <span class="t8">gill</span>, <span class="t8">gilliflower</span>, <span class="t8">gin</span>, <span class="t8">ginger</span>, <span class="t8">gingle</span>, to which may be added <span class="t8">Egypt</span> and <span class="t8">gypsy</span>.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Gh</span> in the beginning of a word has the sound of the hard <span class="t8">g</span>, as <span class="t8">ghostly</span>; in the middle, and sometimes at the end, it is quite silent, as <span class="t8">though</span>, <span class="t8">right</span>, <span class="t8">sought</span>, spoken <span class="t8">tho&rsquo;</span>, <span class="t8">rite</span>, <span class="t8">soute</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">It has often at the end the sound of <span class="t8">f</span>, as <span class="t8">laugh</span>; whence laughter retains the same sound in the middle; <span class="t8">cough</span>, <span class="t8">trough</span>, <span class="t8">sough</span>, <span class="t8">tough</span>, <span class="t8">enough</span>, <span class="t8">slough</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">It is not to be doubted, but that in the original pronunciation <span class="t8">gh</span> has the force of a consonant deeply guttural, which is still continued among the Scotch.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">G</span> is used before <span class="t8">h</span>, <span class="t8">l</span>, and <span class="t8">r</span>.</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">H.</span></p>
<p class="p21"><span class="t8">H</span><a id="a1094"></a> is a note of aspiration, and shows that the following vowel must be pronounced&nbsp; with a strong emission of breath, as <span class="t8">hat</span>, <span class="t8">horse</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">It seldom begins any but the first syllable, in which it is always sounded with a full breath, except in <span class="t8">heir</span>, <span class="t8">herb</span>, <span class="t8">hostler</span>, <span class="t8">honour</span>, <span class="t8">humble</span>, <span class="t8">honest</span>, <span class="t8">humour</span> and their derivatives.</p>
<p class="p24">It sometimes begins middle or final syllables in words compounded, as <span class="t8">blockhead</span>; or derived from the Latin, as <span class="t8">comprehend</span>.</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">J.</span></p>
<p class="p21"><span class="t8">J</span> consonant sounds uniformly like the soft <span class="t8">g</span>, and is therefore a letter useless, except in etymology, as <span class="t8">ejaculation</span>, <span class="t8">jester</span>, <span class="t8">jocund</span>, <span class="t8">juice</span>.</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">K.</span></p>
<p class="p21"><span class="t8">K</span> has the sound of hard <span class="t8">c</span>, and is used before <span class="t8">e</span> and <span class="t8">i</span>, where, according to English analogy, <span class="t8">c</span> would be soft, as <span class="t8">kept</span>, <span class="t8">king</span>, <span class="t8">skirt</span>, <span class="t8">skeptick</span>, for so it should be written, not <span class="t8">sceptick</span>, because <span class="t8">sc</span> is sounded like <span class="t8">s</span>, as in <span class="t8">scene</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">It is used before <span class="t8">n</span>, as <span class="t8">knell</span>, <span class="t8">knot</span>, but totally loses its sound in modern pronunciation.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">K</span> is never doubled; but <span class="t8">c</span> is used before it to shorten the vowel by a double consonant, as <span class="t8">cockle</span>, <span class="t8">pickle</span>.</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">L.</span></p>
<p class="p21"><span class="t8">L</span> has in English the same liquid sound as in other languages.</p>
<p class="p24">The custom is to double the <span class="t8">l</span> at the end of monosyllables, as <span class="t8">kill</span>, <span class="t8">will</span>, <span class="t8">full</span>. These words were originally written <span class="t8">kille</span>, <span class="t8">wille</span>, <span class="t8">fulle</span>; and when the <span class="t8">e</span> first grew silent, and was afterward omitted, the <span class="t8">ll</span> was retained, to give force, according to the analogy of our language, to the foregoing vowel.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">L</span>, is sometimes mute, as in <span class="t8">calf</span>, <span class="t8">half</span>, <span class="t8">halves</span>, <span class="t8">calves</span>, <span class="t8">could</span>, <span class="t8">would</span>, <span class="t8">should</span>, <span class="t8">psalm</span>, <span class="t8">talk</span>, <span class="t8">salmon</span>, <span class="t8">falcon</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">The Saxons, who delighted in guttural sounds, sometimes aspirated the <span class="t8">l</span> at the beginning of words, as <span class="t8">hlaf</span>, <span class="t8">a loaf</span>, or <span class="t8">bread</span>; <span class="t8">hlaford</span>, <span class="t8">a lord</span>; but this pronunciation is now disused.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Le</span> at the end of words is pronounced like a weak <span class="t8">el</span>, in which the <span class="t8">e</span> is almost mute, as <span class="t8">table</span>, <span class="t8">shuttle</span>.</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">M.</span></p>
<p class="p21"><span class="t8">M</span> has always the same sound, as <span class="t8">murmur</span>, <span class="t8">monumental</span>.</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">N.</span></p>
<p class="p21"><span class="t8">N</span> has always, the same sound, as <span class="t8">noble</span>, <span class="t8">manners</span>.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">N</span> is sometimes mute after <span class="t8">m</span>, as <span class="t8">damn</span>, <span class="t8">condemn</span>, <span class="t8">hymn</span>.</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">P.</span></p>
<p class="p21"><span class="t8">P</span> has always the same sound which the Welsh and Germans confound with <span class="t8">b</span>.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">P</span> is sometimes mute, as in <span class="t8">psalm</span>, and between <span class="t8">m</span> and <span class="t8">t</span>, as <span class="t8">tempt</span>.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Ph</span> is used for <span class="t8">f</span> in words derived from the Greek, as <span class="t8">philosopher</span>, <span class="t8">philanthropy</span>, <span class="t8">Philip</span>.</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">Q.</span></p>
<p class="p21"><span class="t8">Q</span>, as in other languages, is always followed by <span class="t8">u</span>, and has a sound which our Saxon ancestors well expressed by <span class="t8">cw</span>, as <span class="t8">quadrant</span>, <span class="t8">queen</span>, <span class="t8">equestrian</span>, <span class="t8">quilt</span>, <span class="t8">inquiry</span>, <span class="t8">quire</span>, <span class="t8">quotidian</span>. <span class="t8">Qu</span> is never followed by <span class="t8">u</span>.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Qu</span> is sometimes sounded, in words derived from the French, like <span class="t8">k</span>, as <span class="t8">conquer</span>, <span class="t8">liquor</span>, <span class="t8">risque</span>, <span class="t8">chequer</span>.</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">R.</span></p>
<p class="p21"><span class="t8">R</span> has the same rough snarling sound as in the other tongues.</p>
<p class="p24">The Saxons used often to put <span class="t8">h</span> before it, as before <span class="t8">l</span> at the beginning of words.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Rh</span> is used in words derived from the Greek, as <span class="t8">myrrh</span>, <span class="t8">myrrhine</span>, <span class="t8">catarrhous</span>, <span class="t8">rheum</span>, <span class="t8">rheumatick</span>, <span class="t8">rhyme</span>.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Re</span>, at the end of some words derived from the Latin or French, is pronounced like a weak <span class="t8">er</span>, as <span class="t8">theatre</span>, <span class="t8">sepulchre</span>.</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">S.</span></p>
<p class="p21"><span class="t8">S</span> has a hissing sound, as <span class="t8">sibilation</span>, <span class="t8">sister</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">A single <span class="t8">s</span> seldom ends any word, except in the third person of verbs, as <span class="t8">loves</span>, <span class="t8">grows</span>; and the plurals of nouns, as <span class="t8">trees</span>, <span class="t8">bushes</span>, <span class="t8">distresses</span>; the pronouns <span class="t8">this</span>, <span class="t8">his</span>, <span class="t8">ours</span>, <span class="t8">yours</span>, <span class="t8">us</span>; the adverb <span class="t8">thus</span>; and words derived from Latin, as <span class="t8">rebus</span>, <span class="t8">surplus</span>; the close being always either in <span class="t8">se</span>, as <span class="t8">house</span>, <span class="t8">horse</span>, or in <span class="t8">ss</span>, as <span class="t8">grass</span>, <span class="t8">dress</span>, <span class="t8">bliss</span>, <span class="t8">less</span>, anciently <span class="t8">grasse</span>, <span class="t8">dresse</span>.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">S</span>, single at the end of words, has a grosser sound, like that of <span class="t8">z</span>, as <span class="t8">trees</span>, <span class="t8">eyes</span>, except <span class="t8">this</span>, <span class="t8">thus</span>, <span class="t8">us</span>, <span class="t8">rebus</span>, <span class="t8">surplus</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">It sounds like <span class="t8">z</span> before <span class="t8">ion</span>, if a vowel goes before it, as <span class="t8">intrusion</span>; and like <span class="t8">s</span>, if it follows a consonant, as <span class="t8">conversion</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">It sounds like <span class="t8">z</span> before <span class="t8">e</span> mute, as <span class="t8">refuse</span>, and before <span class="t8">y</span> final, as <span class="t8">rosy</span>; and in those words, <span class="t8">bosom</span>, <span class="t8">desire</span>, <span class="t8">wisdom</span>, <span class="t8">prison</span>, <span class="t8">prisoner</span>, <span class="t8">present</span>, <span class="t8">present</span>, <span class="t8">damsel</span>, <span class="t8">casement</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">It is the peculiar quality of <span class="t8">s</span>, that it may be sounded before all consonants, except <span class="t8">x</span> and <span class="t8">z</span>, in which <span class="t8">s</span> is comprised, <span class="t8">x</span> being only <span class="t8">ks</span>, and <span class="t8">z</span> a hard or gross <span class="t8">s</span>. This <span class="t8">s</span> is therefore termed by grammarians <span class="t8">suæ potestatis litera</span>; the reason of which the learned Dr. Clarke erroneously supposed to be, that in some words it might be doubled at pleasure. Thus we find in several languages.</p>
<p class="p24">Σβεννυμι, <span class="t8">scatter</span>, <span class="t8">sdegno</span>, <span class="t8">sdrucciolo</span>, <span class="t8">sfavellare</span>, σφιγξ, <span class="t8">sgombrare</span>, <span class="t8">sgranare</span>, <span class="t8">shake</span>, <span class="t8">slumber</span>, <span class="t8">smell</span>, <span class="t8">snipe</span>, <span class="t8">space</span>, <span class="t8">splendour</span>, <span class="t8">spring</span>, <span class="t8">squeeze</span>, <span class="t8">shrew</span>, <span class="t8">step</span>, <span class="t8">strength</span>, <span class="t8">stramen</span>, <span class="t8">stripe</span>, <span class="t8">sventura</span>, <span class="t8">swell</span>.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">S</span> is mute in <span class="t8">isle</span>, <span class="t8">island</span>, <span class="t8">demesne</span>, <span class="t8">viscount</span>.</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">T.</span></p>
<p class="p21"><span class="t8">T</span> has its customary sound; as <span class="t8">take</span>, <span class="t8">temptation</span>.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Ti</span> before a vowel has the sound of <span class="t8">si</span> as <span class="t8">salvation</span>, except an <span class="t8">s</span> goes before, as <span class="t8">question</span>; excepting likewise derivatives from words ending in <span class="t8">ty</span>, as <span class="t8">mighty</span>, <span class="t8">mightier</span>.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Th</span> has two sounds; the one soft, as <span class="t8">thus</span>, <span class="t8">whether</span>; the other hard, as <span class="t8">thing</span>, <span class="t8">think</span>. The sound is soft in these words, <span class="t8">then</span>, <span class="t8">thence</span>, and <span class="t8">there</span>, with their derivatives and compounds, and in <span class="t8">that</span>, <span class="t8">these</span>, <span class="t8">thou</span>, <span class="t8">thee</span>, <span class="t8">thy</span>, <span class="t8">thine</span>, <span class="t8">their</span>, <span class="t8">they</span>, <span class="t8">this</span>, <span class="t8">those</span>, <span class="t8">them</span>, <span class="t8">though</span>, <span class="t8">thus</span>; and in all words between two vowels, as, <span class="t8">father</span>, <span class="t8">whether</span>; and between <span class="t8">r</span> and a vowel, as <span class="t8">burthen</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">In other words it is hard, as <span class="t8">thick</span>, <span class="t8">thunder</span>, <span class="t8">faith</span>, <span class="t8">faithful</span>. Where it is softened at the end of a word, an <span class="t8">e</span> silent must be added, as <span class="t8">breath</span>, <span class="t8">breathe</span>; <span class="t8">cloth</span>, <span class="t8">clothe</span>.</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">V.</span></p>
<p class="p21"><span class="t8">V</span> has a sound of near affinity to that of <span class="t8">f</span>, as <span class="t8">vain</span>, <span class="t8">vanity</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">From <span class="t8">f</span> in the Islandick alphabet, <span class="t8">v</span> is only distinguished by a diacritical point.</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">W.</span></p>
<p class="p21">Of <span class="t8">w</span>, which in diphthongs is often an undoubted vowel, some grammarians have doubted whether it ever be a consonant; and not rather as it is called a double <span class="t8">u</span>, or <span class="t8">ou</span>, as <span class="t8">water</span> may be resolved into <span class="t8">ouater</span>; but letters of the same sound are always reckoned consonants in other alphabets: and it may be observed, that <span class="t8">w</span> follows a vowel without any hiatus or difficulty of utterance, as <span class="t8">frosty winter</span>.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Wh</span> has a sound accounted peculiar to the English, which the Saxons better expressed by <span class="t8">hw</span>, as, <span class="t8">what</span>, <span class="t8">whence</span>, <span class="t8">whiting</span>; in <span class="t8">whore</span> only, and sometimes in <span class="t8">wholesome</span>, <span class="t8">wh</span> is sounded like a simple <span class="t8">h</span>.</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">X.</span></p>
<p class="p21"><span class="t8">X</span> begins no English word: it has the sound of <span class="t8">ks</span>, as <span class="t8">axle</span>, <span class="t8">extraneous</span>.</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">Y.</span></p>
<p class="p21"><span class="t8">Y</span>, when it follows a consonant, is a vowel; when it precedes either a vowel or a diphthong, is a consonant, as <span class="t8">ye</span>, <span class="t8">young</span>. It is thought by some to be in all cases a vowel. But it may be observed of <span class="t8">y</span> as of <span class="t8">w</span>, that it follows a vowel without any hiatus, as <span class="t8">rosy youth</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">The chief argument by which <span class="t8">w</span> and <span class="t8">y</span> appear to be always vowels is, that the sounds which they are supposed to have as consonants, cannot be uttered after a vowel, like that of all other consonants; thus we say <span class="t8">tu</span>, <span class="t8">ut</span>; <span class="t8">do</span>, <span class="t8">odd</span>; but in <span class="t8">wed</span>, <span class="t8">dew</span>; the two sounds of <span class="t8">w</span> have no resemblance to each other.</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">Z.</span></p>
<p class="p21"><span class="t8">Z</span> begins no word originally English; it has the sound, as its name <span class="t8">izzard</span> or <span class="t8">s hard</span> expresses, of an <span class="t8">s</span> uttered with a closer compression of the palate by the tongue, as <span class="t8">freeze</span>, <span class="t8">froze</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">In orthography I have supposed <span class="t8">orthoepy</span>, or <span class="t8">just utterance of words</span>, to be included; orthography being only the art of expressing certain sounds by proper characters. I have therefore observed in what words any of the letters are mute.</p>
<p class="p24">Most of the writers of English grammar have given long tables of words pronounced otherwise than they are written, and seem not sufficiently to have considered, that of English, as of all living tongues, there is a double pronunciation, one cursory and colloquial, the other regular and solemn. The cursory pronunciation is always vague and uncertain, being made different in different mouths by negligence, unskilfulness, or affectation. The solemn pronunciation, though by no means immutable and permanent, is yet always less remote from the orthography, and less liable to capricious innovation. They have however generally formed their tables according to the cursory speech of those with whom they happened to converse; and concluding that the whole nation combines to vitiate language in one manner, have often established the jargon of the lowest of the people as the model of speech.</p>
<p class="p24">For pronunciation the best general rule is, to consider those as the most elegant speakers who deviate least from the written words.</p>
<p class="p24">There have been many schemes offered for the emendation and settlement of our orthography, which, like that of other nations, being formed by chance, or according to the fancy of the earliest writers in rude ages, was at first very various and uncertain, and is yet sufficiently irregular. Of these reformers some have endeavoured to accommodate orthography better to the pronunciation, without considering that this is to measure by a shadow, to take that for a model or standard which is changing while they apply it. Others, less absurdly indeed, but with equal unlikelihood of success, have endeavoured to proportion the number of letters to that of sounds, that every sound may have its own character, and every character a single sound. Such would be the orthography of a new language, to be formed by a synod of grammarians upon principles of science. But who can hope to prevail on nations to change their practice, and make all their old books useless? or what advantage would a new orthography procure equivalent to the confusion and perplexity of such an alteration?</p>
<p class="p24">Some ingenious men, indeed, have endeavoured to deserve well of their country, by writing <span class="t8">honor</span> and <span class="t8">labor</span> for <span class="t8">honour</span> and <span class="t8">labour</span>, <span class="t8">red</span> for <span class="t8">read</span> in the preter-tense, <span class="t8">sais</span> for <span class="t8">says</span>, <span class="t8">repete</span> tor <span class="t8">repeat</span>, <span class="t8">explane</span> for <span class="t8">explain</span>, or <span class="t8">declame</span> for <span class="t8">declaim</span>. Of these it may be said, that as they have done no good they have done little harm; both because they have innovated little, and because few have followed them.</p>
<p class="p24">The English language has properly no dialects; the style of writers has no professed diversity in the use of words, or of their flexions and terminations, nor differs but by different degrees of skill or care. The oral diction is uniform in no spacious country, but has less variation in England than in most other nations of equal extent. The language of the northern counties retains many words now out of use, but which are commonly of the genuine Teutonick race, and is uttered with a pronunciation which now seems harsh and rough, but was probably used by our ancestors. The northern speech is therefore not barbarous, but obsolete. The speech in the western provinces seems to differ from the general diction rather by a depraved pronunciation, than by any real difference which letters would express.</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">ETYMOLOGY.</span></p>
<p class="p21">Etymology teaches the deduction of one word from another, and the various modifications by which the sense of the same word is diversified; as <span class="t8">horse</span>, <span class="t8">horses</span>; I <span class="t8">love</span>, I <span class="t8">loved</span>.</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t3">Of the</span><span class="t4"> ARTICLE.</span></p>
<p class="p21">The English have two articles, <span class="t8">an</span> or <span class="t8">a</span>, and <span class="t8">the</span>.</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">AN, A.</span></p>
<p class="p21"><span class="t8">A</span> has an indefinite signification, and means <span class="t8">one</span>, with some reference to more; as <span class="t8">This is a good book</span>; that is, <span class="t8">one among the books that are good</span>; <span class="t8">He was killed by a sword</span>; that is, <span class="t8">some sword</span>; <span class="t8">This is a better book for a man than a boy</span>; that is, <span class="t8">for one of those that are men than one of those that are boys</span>; <span class="t8">An army might enter without resistance</span>; that is, <span class="t8">any army</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">In the senses in which we use <span class="t8">a</span> or <span class="t8">an</span> in the singular, we speak in the plural without an article; as <span class="t8">these are good books</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">I have made <span class="t8">an</span> the original article, because it is only the Saxon <span class="t8">an</span>, or <span class="t8">æn</span>, one, applied to a new use, as the German <span class="t8">ein</span>, and the French <span class="t8">un</span>; the <span class="t8">n</span> being cut off before a consonant in the speed of utterance.</p>
<p class="p24">Grammarians of the last age direct, that <span class="t8">an</span> should be used before <span class="t8">h</span>; whence it appears that the English anciently asperated less. <span class="t8">An</span> is still used before the silent <span class="t8">h</span>; as <span class="t8">an herb</span>, <span class="t8">an honest man</span>; but otherwise <span class="t8">a</span>; as</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">A</span> horse, <span class="t8">a</span> horse, my kingdom for <span class="t8">a</span> horse. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="t8">Shakespeare.</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">An</span> or <span class="t8">a</span> can only be joined with a singular: the correspondent plural is the noun without an article, as, <span class="t8">I want a pen</span>, <span class="t8">I want pens</span>; or with the pronominal adjective <span class="t8">some</span>, as, <span class="t8">I want</span> some <span class="t8">pens</span>.</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">THE.</span></p>
<p class="p21"><span class="t8">The</span> has a particular and definite signification.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">The</span> fruit</p>
<p class="p24">Of that forbidden tree, whose mortal taste</p>
<p class="p24">Brought death into <span class="t8">the</span> world. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="t8">Milton.</span></p>
<p class="p24">That is, <span class="t8">that particular fruit</span>, and <span class="t8">this world in which we live</span>. So, <span class="t8">He giveth fodder for</span> the <span class="t8">cattle, and green herbs for</span> the <span class="t8">use of man</span>; that is, for <span class="t8">those beings that are cattle</span>, and <span class="t8">his use that is man</span>.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">The</span> is used in both numbers.</p>
<p class="p24">I am as free as Nature first made man,</p>
<p class="p24">Ere <span class="t8">the</span> base laws of servitude began,</p>
<p class="p24">When wild in woods <span class="t8">the</span> noble savage ran. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="t8">Dryden.</span></p>
<p class="p24">Many words are used without articles; as</p>
<p class="p24">1. Proper names, as <span class="t8">John</span>, <span class="t8">Alexander</span>, <span class="t8">Longinus</span>, <span class="t8">Aristarchus</span>, <span class="t8">Jerusalem</span>, <span class="t8">Athens</span>, <span class="t8">Rome</span>, <span class="t8">London</span>. GOD is used as a proper name.</p>
<p class="p24">2. Abstract names, as <span class="t8">blackness</span>, <span class="t8">witch-craft</span>, <span class="t8">virtue</span>, <span class="t8">vice</span>, <span class="t8">beauty</span>, <span class="t8">ugliness</span>, <span class="t8">love</span>, <span class="t8">hatred</span>, <span class="t8">anger</span>, <span class="t8">good-nature</span>, <span class="t8">kindness</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">3. Words in which nothing but the mere being of any thing is implied: This is not <span class="t8">beer</span>, but <span class="t8">water</span>; this is not <span class="t8">brass</span>, but <span class="t8">steel</span>.</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t3">Of</span><span class="t4"> NOUNS SUBSTANTIVE.</span></p>
<p class="p21">The relations of English nouns to words going before or following are not expressed by <span class="t8">cases</span>, or changes of termination, but, as in most of the other European languages, by prepositions, unless we may be said to have a genitive case.</p>

<p class="p30"><span class="t8">from</span> Masters, <span class="t8">from the</span> Masters.</p>
<p class="p1">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p30">Our nouns are therefore only declined thus:</p>
<p class="p30">Master,</p>
<p class="p30"><span class="t8">Gen.</span> Master&rsquo;s.</p>
<p class="p30"><span class="t8">Plur.</span> Masters.</p>
<p class="p1">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p30">Scholar,</p>
<p class="p30"><span class="t8">Gen.</span> Scholar&rsquo;s.</p>
<p class="p30"><span class="t8">Plur.</span> Scholars.</p>
<p class="p1">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p24">These genitives are always written with a mark of elision, <span class="t8">master&rsquo;s</span>, <span class="t8">scholar&rsquo;s</span>, according to an opinion long received, that the <span class="t8">&lsquo;s</span> is a contraction of <span class="t8">his</span>, as the <span class="t8">soldier&rsquo;s valour</span>, for <span class="t8">the soldier</span> his <span class="t8">valour</span>: but this cannot be the true original, because <span class="t8">&lsquo;s</span> is put to female nouns, <span class="t8">Woman&rsquo;s beauty</span>; the <span class="t8">Virgin&rsquo;s delicacy</span>; <span class="t8">Haughty Juno&rsquo;s unrelenting hate</span>; and collective nouns, as <span class="t8">Women&rsquo;s passions</span>; <span class="t8">the rabble&rsquo;s insolence</span>; <span class="t8">the multitude&rsquo;s folly</span>: in all these cases it is apparent that <span class="t8">his</span> cannot be understood. We say likewise <span class="t8">the foundation&rsquo;s strength</span>; <span class="t8">the diamond&rsquo;s lustre</span>; <span class="t8">the winter&rsquo;s severity</span>: but in these cases <span class="t8">his</span> may be understood, <span class="t8">he</span> and <span class="t8">his</span> having formerly been applied to neuters in the place now supplied by <span class="t8">it</span> and <span class="t8">its</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">The learned and sagacious <span class="t8">Wallis</span>, to whom every English grammarian owes a tribute of reverence, calls this modification of the noun an <span class="t8">adjective possessive</span>; I think with no more propriety than he might have applied the same to the genitive in <span class="t8">equitum decus</span>, <span class="t8">Trojæ oris</span>, or any other Latin genitive. Dr. Lowth, on the other part, supposes the possessive pronouns <span class="t8">mine</span> and <span class="t8">thine</span> to be genitive cases.</p>
<p class="p24">This termination of the noun seems to constitute a real genitive indicating possession. It is derived to us from the Saxon&rsquo;s who declined <span class="t8">smith</span>, a smith; Gen. <span class="t8">smither</span>, of a smith; Plur. <span class="t8">smither</span> or <span class="t8">smithar</span>, smiths; and so in two other of their seven declensions.</p>
<p class="p24">It is a further confirmation of this opinion, that in the old poets both the genitive and plural were longer by a syllable than the original word: <span class="t8">knitis</span> for <span class="t8">knight&rsquo;s</span>, in Chaucer; <span class="t8">leavis</span> for <span class="t8">leaves</span><a id="a1095"></a>, in Spenser.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p24">When a word ends in <span class="t8">s</span>, the genitive may be the same with the nominative, as <span class="t8">Venus temple</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">The plural is formed by adding <span class="t8">s</span>, as <span class="t8">table</span>, <span class="t8">tables</span>; <span class="t8">fly</span>, <span class="t8">flies</span>; <span class="t8">sister</span>, <span class="t8">sisters</span>; <span class="t8">wood</span>, <span class="t8">woods</span>; or <span class="t8">es</span> where <span class="t8">s</span> could not otherwise be sounded, as after <span class="t8">ch</span>, <span class="t8">s</span>, <span class="t8">sh</span>, <span class="t8">x</span>, <span class="t8">z</span>; after <span class="t8">c</span> sounded like <span class="t8">s</span>, and <span class="t8">g</span> like <span class="t8">j</span>; the mute <span class="t8">e</span> is vocal before <span class="t8">s</span>, as <span class="t8">lance</span>, <span class="t8">lances</span>; <span class="t8">outrage</span>, <span class="t8">outrages</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">The formation of the plural and genitive singular is the same.</p>
<p class="p24">A few words still make the plural in <span class="t8">n</span>, as <span class="t8">men</span>, <span class="t8">women</span>, <span class="t8">oxen</span>, <span class="t8">swine</span>, and more anciently <span class="t8">eyen, shoon</span>. This formation is that which generally prevails in the Teutonick dialects.</p>
<p class="p24">Words that end in <span class="t8">f</span> commonly form their plural by <span class="t8">ves</span>, as <span class="t8">loaf</span>, <span class="t8">loaves</span>; <span class="t8">calf</span>, <span class="t8">calves</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">Except a few, <span class="t8">muff</span>, <span class="t8">muffs</span>; <span class="t8">chief</span>, <span class="t8">chiefs</span>. So <span class="t8">hoof</span>, <span class="t8">roof</span>, <span class="t8">proof</span>, <span class="t8">relief</span>, <span class="t8">mischief</span>, <span class="t8">puff</span>, <span class="t8">cuff</span>, <span class="t8">dwarf</span>, <span class="t8">handkerchief</span>, <span class="t8">grief</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">Irregular plurals are <span class="t8">teeth</span> from <span class="t8">tooth</span>, <span class="t8">lice</span> from <span class="t8">louse</span>, <span class="t8">mice</span> from <span class="t8">mouse</span>, <span class="t8">geese</span> from <span class="t8">goose</span>, <span class="t8">feet</span> from <span class="t8">foot</span>, <span class="t8">dice</span> from <span class="t8">die</span>, <span class="t8">pence</span> from <span class="t8">penny</span>, <span class="t8">brethren</span> from <span class="t8">brother</span>, <span class="t8">children</span> from <span class="t8">child</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">Plurals ending in <span class="t8">s</span> have no genitives; but we say, Womens <span class="t8">excellencies</span>, and <span class="t8">Weigh the</span> mens <span class="t8">wits against the</span> ladies <span class="t8">hairs</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">Dr. Willis thinks <span class="t8">the Lords&rsquo; house</span> may he said for <span class="t8">the house of Lords</span>; but such phrases are not now in use; and surely an English ear rebels against them. They would commonly produce a troublesome ambiguity, as <span class="t8">the Lord&rsquo;s house</span> may be the <span class="t8">house of Lords</span>, or the <span class="t8">house of a Lord</span>. Besides that the mark of elision is improper, for in the <span class="t8">Lords&rsquo; house</span> nothing is cut off.</p>
<p class="p24">Some English substantives, like those of many other languages, change their termination as they express different sexes; as <span class="t8">prince</span>, <span class="t8">princess</span>; <span class="t8">actor</span>, <span class="t8">actress</span>; <span class="t8">lion</span>, <span class="t8">lioness</span>; <span class="t8">hero</span>, <span class="t8">heroine</span>. To these mentioned by Dr. Lowth may be added <span class="t8">arbitress</span>, <span class="t8">poetess</span>, <span class="t8">chauntress</span>, <span class="t8">duchess</span>, <span class="t8">tigress</span>, <span class="t8">governess</span>, <span class="t8">tutress</span>, <span class="t8">peeress</span>, <span class="t8">authoress</span>, <span class="t8">traytress</span>, and perhaps othets. Of these variable terminations we have only a sufficient number to make us feel our want; for when we say of a woman that she is a <span class="t8">philosopher</span>, an <span class="t8">astronomer</span>, a <span class="t8">builder</span>, a <span class="t8">weaver</span>, a <span class="t8">dancer</span>, we perceive an impropriety in the termination which we cannot avoid; but we can say that she is an <span class="t8">architect</span>, a <span class="t8">botanist</span>, a <span class="t8">student</span>. because these terminations have not annexed to them the notion of sex. In words which the necessities of life are often requiring, the sex is distinguished not by different terminations but by different names, as a <span class="t8">bull</span>, a <span class="t8">cow</span>; a <span class="t8">horse</span>, a <span class="t8">mare</span>; <span class="t8">equus</span>, <span class="t8">equa</span>; a <span class="t8">cock</span>, a <span class="t8">hen</span>; and sometimes by pronouns prefixed, as <span class="t8">a</span> he-<span class="t8">goat</span>, <span class="t8">a</span>, she-<span class="t8">goat</span>.</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t3">Of</span><span class="t4"> ADJECTIVES.</span></p>
<p class="p21">Adjectives in the English language are wholly indeclinable; having neither case, gender, nor number, and being added to substantives in all relations without any change; as, <span class="t8">a good woman</span>, <span class="t8">good women</span>, <span class="t8">of a good woman</span>; <span class="t8">a good man</span>, <span class="t8">good men</span>, <span class="t8">of good men</span>.</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t3">The Comparison of Adjectives.</span></p>
<p class="p21">The comparative degree of adjectives is formed by adding <span class="t8">er</span>, the superlative by adding <span class="t8">est</span>, to the positive; as, <span class="t8">fair</span>, fair<span class="t8">er</span>, fair<span class="t8">est</span>; <span class="t8">lovely</span>, loveli<span class="t8">er</span>, loveli<span class="t8">est</span>; <span class="t8">sweet</span>, sweet<span class="t8">er</span>, sweet<span class="t8">est</span>; <span class="t8">low</span>, low<span class="t8">er</span>, low<span class="t8">est</span>; <span class="t8">high</span>, high<span class="t8">er</span>, high<span class="t8">est</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">Some words are irregularly compared; as, <span class="t8">good</span>, <span class="t8">better</span>, <span class="t8">best</span>; <span class="t8">bad</span>, <span class="t8">worse</span>, <span class="t8">worst</span>; <span class="t8">little</span>, <span class="t8">less</span>, <span class="t8">least</span>; <span class="t8">near</span>, <span class="t8">nearer</span>, <span class="t8">next</span>; <span class="t8">much</span>, <span class="t8">more</span>, <span class="t8">most</span>; <span class="t8">many</span> (for <span class="t8">moe</span>), <span class="t8">more</span> (for <span class="t8">moer</span>) <span class="t8">most</span> (for <span class="t8">moest</span>); <span class="t8">late</span>, <span class="t8">later</span>, <span class="t8">latest</span> or <span class="t8">last</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">Some comparatives form a superlative by adding, <span class="t8">most</span>, as <span class="t8">nether</span>, <span class="t8">nethermost</span>; <span class="t8">outer</span>, <span class="t8">outermost</span>; <span class="t8">under</span>, <span class="t8">undermost</span>; <span class="t8">up</span>, <span class="t8">upper</span>, <span class="t8">uppermost</span>; <span class="t8">fore</span>, <span class="t8">former</span>, <span class="t8">foremost</span>.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Most</span> is sometimes added to a substantive, as, <span class="t8">topmost</span>, <span class="t8">southmost</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">Many adjectives do not admit of comparison by terminations, and are only compared by <span class="t8">more</span> and <span class="t8">most</span>, as, <span class="t8">benevolent</span>, <span class="t8">more benevolent</span>, <span class="t8">most benevolent</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">All adjectives may be compared by <span class="t8">more</span> and <span class="t8">most</span>, even when they have comparatives and superlatives regularly formed; as, <span class="t8">fair</span>, <span class="t8">fairer</span>, or <span class="t8">more fair</span>; <span class="t8">fairest</span>, or <span class="t8">most fair</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">In adjectives that admit a regular comparison, the comparative <span class="t8">more</span> is oftener used than the superlative <span class="t8">most</span>, as <span class="t8">more fair</span> is oftener written for <span class="t8">fairer</span>, than <span class="t8">most fair</span> for <span class="t8">fairest</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">The comparison of adjectives is very uncertain; and being much regulated by commodiousness of utterance, or agreeableness of sound, is not easily reduced to rules.</p>
<p class="p24">Monosyllables are commonly compared.</p>
<p class="p24">Polysyllables, or words of more than two syllables, are seldom compared otherwise than by <span class="t8">more</span> and <span class="t8">most</span>, as, <span class="t8">deplorable</span>, <span class="t8">more deplorable</span>, <span class="t8">most deplorable</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">Dissyllables are seldom compared if they terminate in <span class="t8">some</span>, as <span class="t8">fulsome</span>, <span class="t8">toilsome</span>; in <span class="t8">ful</span>, as, <span class="t8">careful</span>, <span class="t8">spleenful</span>, <span class="t8">dreadful</span>; in <span class="t8">ing</span>, as <span class="t8">trifling</span>, <span class="t8">charming</span>; in <span class="t8">ous</span>, as <span class="t8">porous</span>; in <span class="t8">less</span>, as, <span class="t8">careless</span>, <span class="t8">harmless</span>; in <span class="t8">ed</span>, as <span class="t8">wretched</span>; in <span class="t8">id</span>, as <span class="t8">candid</span>; in <span class="t8">al</span>, as <span class="t8">mortal</span>; in <span class="t8">ent</span>, as <span class="t8">recent</span>, <span class="t8">fervent</span>; in <span class="t8">ain</span>, as <span class="t8">certain</span>; in <span class="t8">ive</span>, as <span class="t8">missive</span>; in <span class="t8">dy</span>, as <span class="t8">woody</span>; in <span class="t8">fy</span>, as <span class="t8">puffy</span>; in <span class="t8">ky</span>, as <span class="t8">rocky</span>, except <span class="t8">lucky</span>; in <span class="t8">my</span>, as <span class="t8">roomy</span>; in <span class="t8">ny</span>, as <span class="t8">skinny</span>; in <span class="t8">py</span>, as <span class="t8">ropy</span>, except <span class="t8">happy</span>; in <span class="t8">ry</span>, as <span class="t8">hoary</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">Some comparatives and superlatives are yet found in good writers formed without regard to the foregoing rules; but in a language subjected so little and so lately to grammar, such anomalies must frequently occur.</p>
<p class="p24">So <span class="t8">shady</span> is compared by <span class="t8">Milton</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">She in <span class="t8">shadiest</span> covert hid,</p>

<p class="p24">I will now deliver a few of the properest and <span class="t8">naturalest</span> considerations that belong to this piece. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="t8">Wotton&rsquo;s Architecture.</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Wretched</span>, by <span class="t8">Jonson</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">The <span class="t8">wretcheder</span> are the contemners of all helps; such as presuming on their own naturals, deride diligence, and mock at terms when they understand not things. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="t8">Ben Jonson.</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Powerful</span>, by <span class="t8">Milton</span>.</p>

<p class="p24">The termination in <span class="t8">ish</span> may be accounted in some sort a degree of comparison, by which the signification is diminished below the positive, as <span class="t8">black</span>, <span class="t8">blackish</span>, or tending to blackness; <span class="t8">salt</span>, <span class="t8">saltish</span>, or having a little taste of salt; they therefore admit no comparison. This termination is seldom added but to words expressing sensible qualities, nor often to words of above one syllable, and is scarcely used in the solemn or sublime style.</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t3">Of</span><span class="t4"> PRONOUNS.</span></p>
<p class="p21">Pronouns, in the English language, are, <span class="t8">I</span>, <span class="t8">thou</span>, <span class="t8">he</span>, with their plurals, <span class="t8">we</span>, <span class="t8">ye</span>, <span class="t8">they</span>; <span class="t8">it</span>, <span class="t8">who</span>, <span class="t8">which</span>, <span class="t8">what</span>, <span class="t8">whether</span>, <span class="t8">whosoever</span>, <span class="t8">whatsoever</span>, <span class="t8">my</span>, <span class="t8">mine</span>, <span class="t8">our</span>, <span class="t8">ours</span>, <span class="t8">thy</span>, <span class="t8">thine</span>, <span class="t8">your</span>, <span class="t8">yours</span>, <span class="t8">his</span>, <span class="t8">her</span>, <span class="t8">hers</span>, <span class="t8">theirs</span>, <span class="t8">this</span>, <span class="t8">that</span>, <span class="t8">other</span>, <span class="t8">another</span>, the <span class="t8">same</span>, <span class="t8">some</span>.</p>

<p class="p1">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p30"><span class="t8">You</span> is commonly used in modern writers for <span class="t8">ye</span>, particularly in the language of ceremony, where the second person plural is used for the second person singular, <span class="t8">You are my friend</span>.</p>

<p class="p24">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p24">For <span class="t8">it</span> the practice of ancient writers was to use <span class="t8">he</span>, and for <span class="t8">its</span>, <span class="t8">his</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">The possessive pronouns, like other adjectives, are without cases or change of termination.</p>
<p class="p24">The possessive of the first person is <span class="t8">my</span>, <span class="t8">mine</span>, <span class="t8">our</span>, <span class="t8">ours</span>; of the second, <span class="t8">thy</span>, <span class="t8">thine</span>, <span class="t8">your</span>, <span class="t8">yours</span>; of the third, from <span class="t8">he</span>, <span class="t8">his</span>; from <span class="t8">she</span>, <span class="t8">her</span>, and <span class="t8">hers</span>; and in the plural, <span class="t8">their</span>, <span class="t8">theirs</span>, for both sexes.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Ours</span>, <span class="t8">yours</span>, <span class="t8">hers</span>, <span class="t8">theirs</span>, are used when the substantive preceding is separated by a verb, as <span class="t8">These are</span> our <span class="t8">books</span>. <span class="t8">These books</span> are <span class="t8">ours</span>. <span class="t8">Your children excel</span> ours <span class="t8">in stature, but</span> ours <span class="t8">surpass</span> yours <span class="t8">in learning</span>.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Ours</span>, <span class="t8">yours</span>, <span class="t8">hers</span>, <span class="t8">theirs</span>, notwithstanding their seeming plural termination, are applied equally to singular and plural substantives, as, <span class="t8">This book is</span> ours. <span class="t8">These books are</span> ours.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Mine</span> and <span class="t8">thine</span> were formerly used before a vowel, as <span class="t8">mine amiable lady</span>: which though now disused in prose, might be still properly continued in poetry: they are used as <span class="t8">ours</span> and <span class="t8">yours</span>, when they are referred to a substantive preceding, as <span class="t8">thy</span> house is larger than <span class="t8">mine</span>, but <span class="t8">my</span> garden is more spacious than <span class="t8">thine</span>.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Their</span> and <span class="t8">theirs</span> are the possessives likewise of <span class="t8">they</span>, when <span class="t8">they</span> is the plural of <span class="t8">it</span>, and are therefore applied to things.</p>
<p class="p30">Pronouns relative are, <span class="t8">who</span>, <span class="t8">which</span>, <span class="t8">what</span>, <span class="t8">whether</span>, <span class="t8">whosoever</span>, <span class="t8">whatsoever</span>.</p>

<p class="p1">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Who</span> is now used in relation to persons, and <span class="t8">which</span> in relation to things; but they were anciently confounded. At least it was common to say, the man <span class="t8">which</span>, though I remember no example of the thing <span class="t8">who</span>.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Whose</span> is rather the poetical than regular genitive of <span class="t8">which</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">The fruit</p>

<p class="p24">Brought death into the world. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="t8">Milton.</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Whether</span> is only used in the nominative and accusative cases; and has no plural, being applied only to <span class="t8">one</span> of a number, commonly to one of two, as Whether <span class="t8">of these is left I know not</span>. Whether <span class="t8">shall I choose?</span> It is now almost obsolete.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">What</span>, whether relative or interrogative, is without variation.</p>
<p class="p30"><span class="t8">Whosoever</span>, <span class="t8">whatsoever</span>, being compounded of <span class="t8">who</span> or <span class="t8">what</span>, and <span class="t8">soever</span>, follow the rule of their primitives.</p>

<p class="p24">The plural <span class="t8">others</span> is not used but when it is referred to a substantive preceding, as <span class="t8">I have sent </span>other<span class="t8"> horses</span>. <span class="t8">I have not sent the same </span>horses<span class="t8">, but </span>others.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Another</span>, being only <span class="t8">an other</span>, has no plural.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Here</span>, <span class="t8">there</span>, and <span class="t8">where</span>, joined with certain particles, have a relative and pronominal use. <span class="t8">Hereof</span>, <span class="t8">herein</span>, <span class="t8">hereby</span>, <span class="t8">hereafter</span>, <span class="t8">herewith</span>, <span class="t8">thereof</span>, <span class="t8">therein</span>, <span class="t8">thereby</span>, <span class="t8">thereupon</span>, <span class="t8">therewith</span>, <span class="t8">whereof</span>, <span class="t8">wherein</span>, <span class="t8">whereby</span>, <span class="t8">whereupon</span>, <span class="t8">wherewith</span>, which signify, <span class="t8">of this</span>, <span class="t8">in this</span>, &amp;c. <span class="t8">of that</span>, <span class="t8">in that</span>, &amp;c. <span class="t8">of which</span>, <span class="t8">in which</span>, &amp;c.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Therefore</span> and <span class="t8">wherefore</span>, which are properly <span class="t8">there for</span> and <span class="t8">where for</span>, <span class="t8">for that</span>, <span class="t8">for which</span>, are now reckoned conjunctions, and continued in use. The rest seem to be passing by degrees into neglect, though proper, useful, and analogous. They are referred both to singular and plural antecedents.</p>
<p class="p24">There are two more words used only in conjunction with pronouns, <span class="t8">own</span> and <span class="t8">self</span>.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Own</span> is added to possessives, both singular and plural, as my <span class="t8">own</span> hand, our <span class="t8">own</span> house. It is emphatical, and implies a silent contrariety, or opposition; as, <span class="t8">I live in my own house</span>, that is, <span class="t8">not in a hired house</span>. <span class="t8">This I did with my own hand</span>, that is, <span class="t8">without help</span> or <span class="t8">not by proxy</span>.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Self</span> is added to possessives, as <span class="t8">myself</span>, <span class="t8">yourselves</span>; and sometimes to personal pronouns, as <span class="t8">himself</span>, <span class="t8">itself</span>, <span class="t8">themselves</span>. It then, like <span class="t8">own</span>, expresses emphasis and opposition, as <span class="t8">I did this myself</span>, that is, <span class="t8">not another</span>; or it forms a reciprocal pronoun, as <span class="t8">We hurt ourselves by vain rage</span>.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Himself</span>, <span class="t8">itself</span>, <span class="t8">themselves</span>, are supposed by Wallis to be put by corruption, for <span class="t8">his self</span>, <span class="t8">it self</span>, <span class="t8">their selves</span>; so that <span class="t8">self</span> is always a substantive. This seems justly observed, for we say, <span class="t8">He came himself</span>; <span class="t8">Himself shall do this</span>; where <span class="t8">himself</span> cannot be an accusative.</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t3">Of the</span><span class="t4"> VERB.</span></p>
<p class="p21">English verbs are active, as <span class="t8">I love</span>; or neuter, as <span class="t8">I languish</span>. The neuters are formed like the actives.</p>
<p class="p24">Most verbs signifying <span class="t8">action</span> may likewise signify <span class="t8">condition</span> or <span class="t8">habit</span>, and become <span class="t8">neuters</span>; as <span class="t8">I love</span>, I am in love; <span class="t8">I strike</span>, I am now striking.</p>
<p class="p24">Verbs have only two tenses inflected in their terminations, the present, and simple preterit; the other tenses are compounded of the auxiliary verbs, <span class="t8">have</span>, <span class="t8">shall</span>, <span class="t8">will</span>, <span class="t8">let</span>, <span class="t8">may</span>, <span class="t8">can</span>, and the infinitive of the active or neuter verb.</p>
<p class="p24">The passive voice is formed by joining the participle preterit to the substantive verb, as <span class="t8">I am loved</span>.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">To have</span>. Indicative Mood.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Present Tense.</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Sing.</span> <span class="t8">I</span> have, <span class="t8">thou</span> hast, <span class="t8">he</span> hath <span class="t8">or</span> has,</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Plur.</span> <span class="t8">We</span> have, <span class="t8">ye</span> have, <span class="t8">they</span> have.</p>

<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Participle preterit.</span><a id="a1098"></a> Done.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p24">Do is sometimes used superfluously, as <span class="t8">I</span> do <span class="t8">love, I</span> did <span class="t8">love</span>; simply for <span class="t8">I love</span>, or <span class="t8">I loved</span>; but this is considered as a vitious mode of speech.</p>
<p class="p24">It is sometimes used emphatically; as,</p>
<p class="p24">I do love thee, and when I love thee not,</p>
<p class="p24">Chaos is come again. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="t8">Shakespeare.</span></p>
<p class="p24">It is frequently joined with a negative; as, <span class="t8">I like her, but I</span> do <span class="t8">not love her; I wished him success, but</span> did <span class="t8">not help him</span>. This, by custom at least, appears more easy than the other form of expressing the same sense by a negative adverb after the verb, <span class="t8">I like her, but</span> love <span class="t8">her</span> not.</p>
<p class="p24">The imperative prohibitory is seldom applied in the second person, at least in prose, without the word <span class="t8">do</span>; as, <span class="t8">Stop him, but do not hurt him</span>; <span class="t8">Praise beauty, but do not dote on it</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">Its chief use is in interrogative forms of speech, in which it is used through all the persons; as, Do <span class="t8">I live</span>? Dost <span class="t8">thou strike me</span>? Do <span class="t8">they rebel</span>? Did <span class="t8">I complain</span>? Didst <span class="t8">thou love her</span>? Did <span class="t8">she die</span>? So likewise in negative interrogations; Do <span class="t8">I not yet grieve</span>? Did <span class="t8">she not die</span>?</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Do</span> and <span class="t8">did</span> are thus used only for the present and simple preterit.</p>
<p class="p24">There is another manner of conjugating neuter verbs, which, when it is used, may not improperly denominate them <span class="t8">neuter passives</span>, as they are inflected according to the passive form by the help of the verb substantive <span class="t8">to be</span>. They answer nearly to the reciprocal verbs in French; as, <span class="t8">I am risen</span>, surrexi, <span class="t8">Latin</span>; Je me suis levé, <span class="t8">French</span>. <span class="t8">I was walked out</span>, exieram: Je m&rsquo;étois promené.</p>
<p class="p24">In like manner we commonly express the present tense; as, I am going, <span class="t8">eo</span>. I am grieving, <span class="t8">doleo</span>, She is dying, <span class="t8">illa moritur</span>. The tempest is raging, <span class="t8">furit procella</span>. I am pursuing an enemy, <span class="t8">hostem insequor</span>. So the other tenses, as, <span class="t8">We were walking</span>, ετυγχανομεν περιπατουντες, <span class="t8">I have been walking</span>, <span class="t8">I had been walking</span>, <span class="t8">I shall</span> or <span class="t8">will be walking.</span></p>
<p class="p24">There is another manner of using the active participle, which gives it a passive signification: as, The grammar is now printing, <span class="t8">grammatica jam nunc chartis imprimitur</span>. The brass is forging, <span class="t8">ara excuduntur</span>. This is, in my opinion, a vitious expression, probably corrupted from a phrase more pure, but now somewhat obsolete: <span class="t8">The book is</span> a <span class="t8">printing</span>, <span class="t8">The brass is</span> a <span class="t8">forging</span>; a being properly at, and <span class="t8">printing</span> and <span class="t8">forging</span> verbal nouns signifying action, according to the analogy of this language.</p>
<p class="p24">The indicative and conjunctive moods are by modern writers frequently confounded, or rather the conjunctive is wholly neglected, when some convenience of versification docs not invite its revival. It is used among the purer writers of former times after <span class="t8">if</span>, <span class="t8">though</span>, <span class="t8">ere</span>, <span class="t8">before</span>, <span class="t8">till</span> or <span class="t8">until</span>, <span class="t8">whether</span>, <span class="t8">except</span>, <span class="t8">unless</span>, <span class="t8">whatsoever</span>, <span class="t8">whomsoever</span>, and words of wishing; as, <span class="t8">Doubtless thou art our father</span>, though <span class="t8">Abraham</span> be <span class="t8">ignorant of us, and Israel</span> acknowledge <span class="t8">us not</span>.</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t3">Of</span><span class="t4"> IRREGULAR VERBS.</span></p>
<p class="p21">The English verbs were divided by Ben Jonson into four conjugations, without any reason arising from the nature of the language, which has properly but one conjugation, such as has been exemplified: from which all deviations are to be considered as anomalies, which are indeed, in our monosyllable Saxon verbs, and the verbs derived from them, very frequent; but almost all the verbs which have been adopted from other languages, follow the regular form.</p>
<p class="p24">Our verbs are observed by Dr. Wallis to be irregular only in the formation of the preterit, and its participle. Indeed, in the scantiness of our conjugations, there is scarcely any other place for irregularity.</p>
<p class="p24">The first irregularity is a slight deviation from the regular form, by rapid utterance or poetical contraction: the last syllable <span class="t8">ed</span> is often joined with the former by suppression of <span class="t8">e</span>; as <span class="t8">lov&rsquo;d</span> for <span class="t8">loved</span>; after <span class="t8">c</span>, <span class="t8">ch</span>, <span class="t8">sh</span>, <span class="t8">f</span>, <span class="t8">k</span>, <span class="t8">x</span>, and after the consonants <span class="t8">s</span>, <span class="t8">th</span>, when more strongly pronounced, and sometimes after <span class="t8">m</span>, <span class="t8">n</span>, <span class="t8">r</span>, if preceded by a short vowel, <span class="t8">t</span> is used in pronunciation, but very seldom in writing rather than d; as <span class="t8">plac&rsquo;t</span>, <span class="t8">snatch&rsquo;t</span>, <span class="t8">fish&rsquo;t</span>, <span class="t8">wak&rsquo;t</span>, <span class="t8">dwel&rsquo;t</span>, <span class="t8">smel&rsquo;t</span> for <span class="t8">plac&rsquo;d</span>, <span class="t8">snatch&rsquo;d</span>, <span class="t8">fish&rsquo;d</span>, <span class="t8">wak&rsquo;d</span>, <span class="t8">dwel&rsquo;d</span>, <span class="t8">smel&rsquo;d</span>; or <span class="t8">placed</span>, <span class="t8">snatched</span>, <span class="t8">fished</span>, <span class="t8">waked</span>, <span class="t8">dwelled</span>, <span class="t8">smelled</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">Those words which terminate in <span class="t8">l</span> or <span class="t8">ll</span>, or <span class="t8">p</span>, make their preterit in <span class="t8">t</span>, even in solemn language; as <span class="t8">crept</span>, <span class="t8">felt</span>, <span class="t8">dwelt</span>; Sometimes after <span class="t8">x</span>, <span class="t8">ed</span> is changed into <span class="t8">t</span>; as <span class="t8">vext</span>: this is not constant.</p>
<p class="p24">A long vowel is often changed into a short one; thus <span class="t8">kept</span>, <span class="t8">slept</span>, <span class="t8">wept</span>, <span class="t8">crept</span>, <span class="t8">swept</span>; from the verbs to <span class="t8">keep</span>, to <span class="t8">sleep</span>, to <span class="t8">weep</span>, to <span class="t8">creep</span>, to <span class="t8">sweep</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">Where <span class="t8">d</span> or <span class="t8">t</span> go before, the additional letter <span class="t8">d</span> or <span class="t8">t</span>, in this contracted form, coalesce into one letter with the radical <span class="t8">d</span> or <span class="t8">t</span>: if <span class="t8">t</span> were the radical, they coalesce into <span class="t8">t</span>; but if <span class="t8">d</span> were the radical, then into <span class="t8">d</span> or <span class="t8">t</span>, as the one or the other letter may be more easily pronounced; as <span class="t8">read</span>, <span class="t8">led</span>, <span class="t8">spread</span>, <span class="t8">shed</span>, <span class="t8">shred</span>, <span class="t8">bid</span>, <span class="t8">hid</span>, <span class="t8">chid</span>, <span class="t8">fed</span>, <span class="t8">bled</span>, <span class="t8">bred</span>, <span class="t8">sped</span>, <span class="t8">strid</span>, <span class="t8">slid</span>, <span class="t8">rid</span>; from the verbs to <span class="t8">read</span>, to <span class="t8">lead</span>, to <span class="t8">spread</span>, to <span class="t8">shed</span>, to <span class="t8">shread</span>, to <span class="t8">bid</span>, to <span class="t8">hide</span>, to <span class="t8">chide</span>, to <span class="t8">feed</span>, to <span class="t8">bleed</span>, to <span class="t8">breed</span>, to <span class="t8">speed</span>, to <span class="t8">stride</span>, to <span class="t8">slide</span>, to <span class="t8">ride</span>. And thus <span class="t8">cast</span>, <span class="t8">hurt</span>, <span class="t8">cost</span>, <span class="t8">burst</span>, <span class="t8">eat</span>, <span class="t8">beat</span>, <span class="t8">sweat</span>, <span class="t8">sit</span>, <span class="t8">quit</span>, <span class="t8">smit</span>, <span class="t8">writ</span>, <span class="t8">bit</span>, <span class="t8">hit</span>, <span class="t8">met</span>, <span class="t8">shot</span>; from the verbs to <span class="t8">cast</span>, to <span class="t8">hurt</span>, to <span class="t8">cost</span>, to <span class="t8">burst</span>, to <span class="t8">eat</span>, to <span class="t8">beat</span>, to <span class="t8">sweat</span>, to <span class="t8">sit</span>, to <span class="t8">quit</span>, to <span class="t8">smite</span>, to <span class="t8">write</span>, to <span class="t8">bite</span>, to <span class="t8">hit</span>, to <span class="t8">meet</span>, to <span class="t8">shoot</span>. And in like manner, <span class="t8">lent</span>, <span class="t8">sent</span>, <span class="t8">rent</span>, <span class="t8">girt</span>; from the verbs to <span class="t8">lend</span>, to <span class="t8">send</span>, to <span class="t8">rend</span>, to <span class="t8">gird</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">The participle preterit or passive is often formed in <span class="t8">en</span> instead of <span class="t8">ed</span>; as, <span class="t8">been</span>, <span class="t8">taken</span>, <span class="t8">given</span>, <span class="t8">slain</span>, <span class="t8">known</span>, from the verbs to <span class="t8">be</span>, to <span class="t8">take</span>, to <span class="t8">give</span>, to <span class="t8">slay</span>, to <span class="t8">know</span>.</p>
<p class="p24"><a id="a1099"></a>Many words have two or more participles,&nbsp; as not only <span class="t8">written</span>, <span class="t8">bitten</span>, <span class="t8">eaten</span>, <span class="t8">beaten</span>, <span class="t8">hidden</span>, <span class="t8">chidden</span>, <span class="t8">shotten</span>, <span class="t8">chosen</span>, <span class="t8">broken</span>; but likewise <span class="t8">writ</span>, <span class="t8">bit</span>, <span class="t8">eat</span>, <span class="t8">beat</span>, <span class="t8">hid</span>, <span class="t8">chid</span>, <span class="t8">shot</span>, <span class="t8">chose</span>, <span class="t8">broke</span>, are promiscuously used in the participle, from the verbs to <span class="t8">write</span>, to <span class="t8">bite</span>, to <span class="t8">eat</span>, to <span class="t8">beat</span>, to <span class="t8">hide</span>, to <span class="t8">chide</span>, to <span class="t8">shoot</span>, to <span class="t8">choose</span>, to <span class="t8">break</span>, and many such like.</p>
<p class="p24">In the same manner, <span class="t8">sown</span>, <span class="t8">shewn</span>, <span class="t8">hewn</span>, <span class="t8">mown</span>, <span class="t8">loaden</span>, <span class="t8">laden</span>, as well as <span class="t8">sow&rsquo;d</span>, <span class="t8">show&rsquo;d</span>, <span class="t8">hew&rsquo;d</span>, <span class="t8">mow&rsquo;d</span>, <span class="t8">loaded</span>, <span class="t8">laded</span>, from the verbs to <span class="t8">sow</span>, to <span class="t8">show</span>, to <span class="t8">hew</span>, to <span class="t8">mow</span>, to <span class="t8">load</span>, to <span class="t8">lade</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">Concerning these double participles it is difficult to give any rule; but he shall seldom err who remembers, that when a verb has a participle distinct from its preterit, as <span class="t8">write</span>, <span class="t8">wrote</span>, <span class="t8">written</span>, that distinct participle is more proper and elegant, as <span class="t8">The book is written</span>, is better than <span class="t8">The book is wrote</span>. <span class="t8">Wrote</span> however may be used in poetry; at least, if we allow any authority to poets, who, in the exultation of genius, think themselves perhaps entitled to trample on grammarians.</p>
<p class="p24">There are other anomalies in the preterit.</p>
<p class="p24">1. <span class="t8">Win</span>, <span class="t8">spin</span>, <span class="t8">begin</span>, <span class="t8">swim</span>, <span class="t8">strike</span>, <span class="t8">stick</span>, <span class="t8">sing</span>, <span class="t8">sting</span>, <span class="t8">fling</span>, <span class="t8">ring</span>, <span class="t8">wring</span>, <span class="t8">spring</span>, <span class="t8">swing</span>, <span class="t8">drink</span>, <span class="t8">sink</span>, <span class="t8">shrink</span>, <span class="t8">stink</span>, <span class="t8">come</span>, <span class="t8">run</span>, <span class="t8">find</span>, <span class="t8">bind</span>, <span class="t8">grind</span>, <span class="t8">wind</span>, both in the preterit imperfect and participle passive, give <span class="t8">won</span>, <span class="t8">spun</span>, <span class="t8">begun</span>, <span class="t8">swum</span>, <span class="t8">struck</span>, <span class="t8">stuck</span>, <span class="t8">sung</span>, <span class="t8">stung</span>, <span class="t8">flung</span>, <span class="t8">rung</span>, <span class="t8">wrung</span>, <span class="t8">sprung</span>, <span class="t8">swung</span>, <span class="t8">drunk</span>, <span class="t8">sunk</span>, <span class="t8">shrunk</span>, <span class="t8">stunk</span>, <span class="t8">come</span>, <span class="t8">run</span>, <span class="t8">found</span>, <span class="t8">bound</span>, <span class="t8">ground</span>, <span class="t8">wound</span>.

Some in the participle passive likewise take <span class="t8">en</span>, as <span class="t8">stricken</span>, <span class="t8">strucken</span>, <span class="t8">drunken</span>, <span class="t8">bounden</span>.</p>

<p class="p10"><span class="t3">Of</span><span class="t4"> DERIVATION.</span></p>
<p class="p21">That the English language may be more easily understood, it is necessary to inquire how its derivative words are deduced from their primitives, and how the primitives are borrowed from other languages. In this inquiry I shall sometimes copy Dr. Wallis, and sometimes endeavour to supply his detects, and rectify his errours.</p>
<p class="p24">Nouns are derived from verbs.</p>
<p class="p24">The thing implied in the verb, as done or produced, is commonly either the present of the verb; as to love, <span class="t8">love</span>; to fright, a <span class="t8">fright</span>; to fight, a <span class="t8">fight</span>; or the preterit of the verb, as to strike, I strick <span class="t8">or</span> strook, a <span class="t8">stroke</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">The action is the same with the participle present, as <span class="t8">loving</span>, <span class="t8">frighting</span>, <span class="t8">fighting</span>, <span class="t8">striking</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">The agent, or person acting, is denoted by the syllable <span class="t8">er</span> added to the verb, as <span class="t8">lover</span>, <span class="t8">frighter</span>, <span class="t8">striker</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">Substantives, adjectives, and sometimes other parts of speech, are changed into verbs: in which case the vowel is often lengthened, or the consonant softened; as, a house, <span class="t8">to house</span>; brass, <span class="t8">to braze</span>; glass, <span class="t8">to glaze</span>; grass, <span class="t8">to graze</span>; price, <span class="t8">to prize</span>; breath, <span class="t8">to breathe</span>; a fish, <span class="t8">to fish</span>; oil, <span class="t8">to oil</span>; further, <span class="t8">to further</span>; forward, <span class="t8">to forward</span>; hinder, <span class="t8">to hinder</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">Sometimes the termination <span class="t8">en</span> is added, especially to adjectives; as, haste, <span class="t8">to hasten</span>; length, <span class="t8">to lengthen</span>; strength, <span class="t8">to strengthen</span>; short, <span class="t8">to shorten</span>; fast, <span class="t8">to fasten</span>; white, <span class="t8">to whiten</span>; black, <span class="t8">to blacken</span>; hard, <span class="t8">to harden</span>; soft, <span class="t8">to soften</span>.</p>
<p class="p24"><a id="a1100"></a>From substantives are formed adjectives&nbsp; of plenty, by adding the termination <span class="t8">y</span>: as a louse, <span class="t8">lousy</span>; wealth, <span class="t8">wealthy</span>; health, <span class="t8">healthy</span>; might, <span class="t8">mighty</span>; worth, <span class="t8">worthy</span>; wit, <span class="t8">witty</span>; lust, <span class="t8">lusty</span>; water, <span class="t8">watery</span>, earth, <span class="t8">earthy</span>; wood, (a wood) <span class="t8">woody</span>; air, <span class="t8">airy</span>; a heart, <span class="t8">hearty</span>; a hand, <span class="t8">handy</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">From substantives are formed adjectives of plenty, by adding the termination <span class="t8">ful</span>, denoting abundance; as, joy, <span class="t8">joyful</span>; fruit, <span class="t8">fruitful</span>; youth, <span class="t8">youthful</span>; care, <span class="t8">careful</span>; use, <span class="t8">useful</span>; delight, <span class="t8">delightful</span>; plenty, <span class="t8">plentiful</span>; help, <span class="t8">helpful</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">Sometimes in almost the same sense, but with some kind of diminution thereof, the termination <span class="t8">some</span> is added, denoting something, or in some degree; as delight, <span class="t8">delightsome</span>; game, <span class="t8">gamesome</span>; irk, <span class="t8">irksome</span>; burden, <span class="t8">burdensome</span>; trouble, <span class="t8">troublesome</span>; light, <span class="t8">lightsome</span>; hand, <span class="t8">handsome</span>; alone, <span class="t8">lonesome</span>; toil, <span class="t8">toilsome</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">On the contrary, the termination less added to substantives, makes adjectives signifying want; as, <span class="t8">worthless</span>, <span class="t8">witless</span>, <span class="t8">heartless</span>, <span class="t8">joyless</span>, <span class="t8">careless</span>, <span class="t8">helpless</span>. Thus comfort, <span class="t8">comfortless</span>; sap, <span class="t8">sapless</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">Privation or contrariety is very often denoted by the participle <span class="t8">un</span> prefixed to many adjectives, or <span class="t8">in</span> before words derived from the Latin; as pleasant, <span class="t8">unpleasant</span>; wise, <span class="t8">unwise</span>; profitable, <span class="t8">unprofitable</span>, patient, <span class="t8">impatient</span>. Thus <span class="t8">unworthy</span>, <span class="t8">unhealthy</span>, <span class="t8">unfruitful</span>, <span class="t8">unuseful</span>, and many more.</p>
<p class="p24">The original English privative is <span class="t8">un</span>; but as we often borrow trom the Latin, or its descendants, words already signifying privation, as <span class="t8">inefficacious</span>, <span class="t8">impious</span>, <span class="t8">indiscreet</span>, the inseparable particles <span class="t8">un</span> and <span class="t8">in</span> have fallen into confusion, from which it is not easy to disentangle them.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Un</span> is prefixed to all words originally English, as <span class="t8">untrue</span>, <span class="t8">untruth</span>, <span class="t8">untaught</span>, <span class="t8">unhandsome</span>.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Un</span> is prefixed to all participles made privative adjectives, as <span class="t8">unfeeling</span>, <span class="t8">unassisting</span>, <span class="t8">unaided</span>, <span class="t8">undelighted</span>, <span class="t8">unendeared</span>.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Un</span> ought never to be prefixed to a participle present to mark a forbearance of action, as <span class="t8">unsighing</span>, but a privation of habit, as <span class="t8">unpitying</span>.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Un</span> is prefixed to most substantives which have an English termination, as <span class="t8">unfertileness</span>, <span class="t8">unperfectness</span>, which, if they have borrowed terminations, take <span class="t8">in</span> or <span class="t8">im</span>, as <span class="t8">infertility</span>, <span class="t8">imperfection</span>; <span class="t8">uncivil</span>, <span class="t8">incivility</span>; <span class="t8">unactive</span>, <span class="t8">inactivity</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">In borrowing adjectives, if we receive them already compounded, it is usual to retain the particle prefixed, as <span class="t8">indecent</span>, <span class="t8">inelegant</span>, <span class="t8">improper</span>; but if we borrow the adjective, and add the privative particle, we commonly prefix <span class="t8">un</span>, as <span class="t8">unpolite</span>, <span class="t8">ungallant</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">The prepositive particles <span class="t8">dis</span> and <span class="t8">mis</span>, derived from the <span class="t8">des</span> and <span class="t8">mes</span> of the French, signify almost the same as <span class="t8">un</span>; yet <span class="t8">dis</span> rather imports contrariety than privation, since it answers to the Latin preposition <span class="t8">de</span>. <span class="t8">Mis</span> insinuates some errour, and for the most part may be rendered by the Latin words <span class="t8">male</span> or <span class="t8">perperam</span>. To like, <span class="t8">to dislike</span>; honour, <span class="t8">dishonour</span>; to honour, to grace, <span class="t8">to dishonour</span>, <span class="t8">to disgrace</span>; to deign, <span class="t8">to disdeign</span>; chance, hap, <span class="t8">mischance</span>, <span class="t8">mishap</span>; to take, <span class="t8">to mistake</span>; deed, <span class="t8">misdeed</span>; to use, <span class="t8">to misuse</span>; to employ, <span class="t8">to misemploy</span>, to apply, <span class="t8">to misapply</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">Words derived from Latin written with <span class="t8">de</span> or <span class="t8">dis</span> retain the same signification; as <span class="t8">distinguish</span>, distinguo; <span class="t8">detract</span>, detraho; <span class="t8">defame</span>, defamo; <span class="t8">detain</span>, detineo.</p>
<p class="p24">The termination <span class="t8">ly</span> added to substantives, and sometimes to adjectives, forms adjectives that import some kind of similitude or agreement, being formed by contraction of <span class="t8">lick</span> or <span class="t8">like</span>. A giant, <span class="t8">giantly</span>, <span class="t8">giantlike</span>; earth, <span class="t8">earthly</span>; heaven, <span class="t8">heavenly</span>; world, <span class="t8">worldly</span>; God, <span class="t8">godly</span>; good, <span class="t8">goodly</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">The same termination <span class="t8">ly</span>, added to adjectives, forms adverbs of like signification; as, beautiful, <span class="t8">beautifully</span>; sweet, <span class="t8">sweetly</span>; that is, <span class="t8">in a beautiful manner</span>; <span class="t8">with some degree of sweetness</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">The termination <span class="t8">ish</span> added to adjectives, imports diminution; and added to substantives, imports similitude or tendency to a character; as green, <span class="t8">greenish</span>; white, <span class="t8">whitish</span>; soft, <span class="t8">softish</span>; a thief, <span class="t8">thievish</span>; a wolf, <span class="t8">wolfish</span>; a child, <span class="t8">childish</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">We have forms of diminutives in substantives, though not frequent; as a hill, <span class="t8">a hillock</span>; a cock, <span class="t8">a cockrel</span>; a pike, <span class="t8">a pickrel</span>; this is a French termination: a goose, <span class="t8">a gosling</span>; this is a German termination: a lamb, <span class="t8">a lambkin</span>; a chick, <span class="t8">a chicken</span>; a man, <span class="t8">a manikin</span>; a pipe, <span class="t8">a pipkin</span>; and thus <span class="t8">Halkin</span>, whence the patronymick, <span class="t8">Hawkins</span>; <span class="t8">Wilkin</span>, <span class="t8">Thomkin</span>, and others.</p>
<p class="p24">Yet still there is another form of diminution among the English, by lessening the sound itself, especially of vowels, as there is a form of augmenting them by enlarging or even lengthening it; and that sometimes not so much by change of the letters, as of their pronunciation; as, <span class="t8">sup</span>, <span class="t8">sip</span>, <span class="t8">soop</span>, <span class="t8">sop</span>, <span class="t8">sippet</span>, where, besides the extenuation of the vowel, there is added the French termination <span class="t8">et</span>; <span class="t8">top</span>, <span class="t8">tip</span>; <span class="t8">spit</span>, <span class="t8">spout</span>; <span class="t8">babe</span>, <span class="t8">baby</span>; <span class="t8">booby</span>, Βουπαις; <span class="t8">great</span> pronounced long, especially if with a stronger sound, <span class="t8">grea-t</span>; little, pronounced long <span class="t8">lee-tle</span>; <span class="t8">ting</span>, <span class="t8">tang</span>, <span class="t8">tong</span>, imports a succession of smaller and then greater sounds; and so in <span class="t8">jingle</span>, <span class="t8">jangle</span>, <span class="t8">tingle</span>, <span class="t8">tangle</span>, and many other made words.</p>
<p class="p24">Much however of this is arbitrary and fanciful, depending wholly on oral utterance, and therefore scarcely worthy the notice of Wallis.</p>
<p class="p24">Of concrete adjectives are made abstract substantives, by adding the termination <span class="t8">ness</span>; and a few in <span class="t8">hood</span> or <span class="t8">head</span>, noting character or qualities: as white, <span class="t8">whiteness</span>; hard, <span class="t8">hardness</span>; great, <span class="t8">greatness</span>; skilful, <span class="t8">skilfulness</span>, <span class="t8">unskilfulness</span>; <span class="t8">godhead</span>, <span class="t8">manhood</span>, <span class="t8">maidenhead</span>, <span class="t8">widowhood</span>, <span class="t8">knighthood</span>, <span class="t8">priesthood</span>, <span class="t8">likelihood</span>, <span class="t8">falsehood</span>.</p>
<p class="p24"><a id="a1101"></a>There are other abstracts, partly derived from adjectives, and partly from&nbsp; verbs, which are formed by the addition of the termination <span class="t8">th</span>, a small change being sometimes made; as long, <span class="t8">length</span>; strong, <span class="t8">strength</span>; broad, <span class="t8">breadth</span>; wide, <span class="t8">width</span>, deep, <span class="t8">depth</span>; true, <span class="t8">truth</span>; warm, <span class="t8">warmth</span>; dear, <span class="t8">dearth</span>; slow, <span class="t8">slowth</span>; merry, <span class="t8">mirth</span>; heal, <span class="t8">health</span>; well, weal, <span class="t8">wealth</span>; dry, <span class="t8">drought</span>; young, <span class="t8">youth</span>; and so moon, <span class="t8">month</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">Like these are some words derived from verbs; die, <span class="t8">death</span>; till, <span class="t8">tilth</span>; grow, <span class="t8">growth</span>; mow, later <span class="t8">mowth</span>, after <span class="t8">mowth</span>; commonly spoken and written later <span class="t8">math</span>, after <span class="t8">math</span>; steal, <span class="t8">stealth</span>; bear, <span class="t8">birth</span>, rue, <span class="t8">ruth</span>; and probably earth, from <span class="t8">to ear</span> or <span class="t8">plow</span>; fly, <span class="t8">flight</span>; weigh, <span class="t8">weight</span>; fray, <span class="t8">fright</span>; draw, <span class="t8">draught</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">These should rather be written <span class="t8">flighth</span>, <span class="t8">frighth</span>, only that custom will not suffer <span class="t8">h</span> to be twice repeated.</p>
<p class="p24">The same form retain <span class="t8">faith</span>, <span class="t8">spight</span>, <span class="t8">wreathe</span>, <span class="t8">wrath</span>, <span class="t8">broth</span>, <span class="t8">froth</span>, <span class="t8">breath</span>, <span class="t8">sooth</span>, <span class="t8">worth</span>, <span class="t8">light</span>, <span class="t8">wight</span>, and the like, whose primitives are either entirely obsolete, or seldom occur. Perhaps they are derived from <span class="t8">fey</span> or <span class="t8">foy</span>, <span class="t8">spry</span>, <span class="t8">wry</span>, <span class="t8">wreak</span>, <span class="t8">brew</span>, <span class="t8">mow</span>, <span class="t8">fry</span>, <span class="t8">bray</span>, <span class="t8">say</span>, <span class="t8">work</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">Some ending in <span class="t8">ship</span>, imply an office, employment, or condition; as, <span class="t8">kingship</span>, <span class="t8">wardship</span>, <span class="t8">guardianship</span>, <span class="t8">partnership</span>, <span class="t8">stewardship</span>, <span class="t8">headship</span>, <span class="t8">lordship</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">Thus <span class="t8">worship</span>, that is, <span class="t8">worthship</span>; whence <span class="t8">worshipful</span>, and <span class="t8">to worship</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">Some few ending in <span class="t8">dom</span>, <span class="t8">rick</span>, <span class="t8">wick</span>, do especially denote dominion, at least state or condition; as, <span class="t8">kingdom</span>, <span class="t8">dukedom</span>, <span class="t8">earldom</span>, <span class="t8">princedom</span>, <span class="t8">popedom</span>, <span class="t8">Christendom</span>, <span class="t8">freedom</span>, <span class="t8">wisdom</span>, <span class="t8">whoredom</span>, <span class="t8">bishoprick</span>, <span class="t8">bailiwick</span>.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Ment</span> and <span class="t8">age</span> are plainly French terminations and are of the same import with us as among them, scarcely ever occurring, except in words derived from the French, as <span class="t8">commandment</span>, <span class="t8">usage</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">There are in English often long trains of words allied by their meaning and derivation; as, <span class="t8">to beat</span>, <span class="t8">a bat</span>, <span class="t8">batoon</span>, <span class="t8">a battle</span>, <span class="t8">a beetle</span>, <span class="t8">a battledore</span>, <span class="t8">to batter</span>, <span class="t8">batter</span>, a kind of glutinous composition for food, made by <span class="t8">beating</span> different bodies into one mass. All these are of similar signification, and perhaps derived from the Latin <span class="t8">batuo</span>. Thus <span class="t8">take</span>, <span class="t8">touch</span>, <span class="t8">tickle</span>, <span class="t8">tack</span>, <span class="t8">tackle</span>; all imply a local conjunction from the Latin <span class="t8">tango</span>, <span class="t8">tetigi</span>, <span class="t8">tactum</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">From <span class="t8">two</span> are formed <span class="t8">twain</span>, <span class="t8">twice</span>, <span class="t8">twenty</span>, <span class="t8">twelve</span>, <span class="t8">twins</span>, <span class="t8">twine</span>, <span class="t8">twist</span>, <span class="t8">twirl</span>, <span class="t8">twig</span>, <span class="t8">twitch</span>, <span class="t8">twinge</span>, <span class="t8">between</span>, <span class="t8">betwixt</span>, <span class="t8">twilight</span>, <span class="t8">twibil</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">The following remarks, extracted from Wallis, are ingenious but of more subtlety than solidity, and such as perhaps might in every language be enlarged without end.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Sn</span> usually imply the <span class="t8">nose</span>, and what relates to it. From the Latin <span class="t8">nasus</span> are derived the French <span class="t8">nez</span> and the English <span class="t8">nose</span>; and <span class="t8">nesse</span>, a promontory, as projecting like a nose. But as if from the consonants <span class="t8">ns</span> taken from <span class="t8">nasus</span>, and transposed that they may the better correspond, <span class="t8">sn</span> denote <span class="t8">nasus</span>; and thence are derived many words that relate to the nose, as <span class="t8">snout</span>, <span class="t8">sneeze</span>, <span class="t8">snore</span>, <span class="t8">snort</span>,<span class="t8">snear</span>, <span class="t8">snicker</span>, <span class="t8">snot</span>, <span class="t8">snivel</span>, <span class="t8">snite</span>, <span class="t8">snuff</span>, <span class="t8">snuffle</span>, <span class="t8">snaffle</span>, <span class="t8">snarl</span>, <span class="t8">snudge</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">There is another <span class="t8">sn</span> which may perhaps be derived from the Latin <span class="t8">sinuo</span>, as <span class="t8">snake</span>, <span class="t8">sneak</span>, <span class="t8">snail</span>, <span class="t8">snare</span>; so likewise <span class="t8">snap</span> and <span class="t8">snatch</span>, <span class="t8">snib</span>, <span class="t8">snub</span>. <span class="t8">Bl</span> imply a <span class="t8">blast</span>; as <span class="t8">blow</span>, <span class="t8">blast</span>, <span class="t8">to blast</span>, <span class="t8">to blight</span>, and, metaphorically, <span class="t8">to blast</span> one&rsquo;s reputation; <span class="t8">bleat</span>, <span class="t8">bleak</span>, a <span class="t8">bleak</span> place, to look <span class="t8">bleak</span>, or weather-beaten, <span class="t8">black</span>, <span class="t8">blay</span>, <span class="t8">bleach</span>, <span class="t8">bluster</span>, <span class="t8">blurt</span>, <span class="t8">blister</span>, <span class="t8">blab</span>, <span class="t8">bladder</span>, <span class="t8">blew</span>, <span class="t8">blabber lip&rsquo;t</span>, <span class="t8">blubber-cheek&rsquo;t</span>, <span class="t8">bloted</span>, <span class="t8">blote-herrings</span>, <span class="t8">blast</span>, <span class="t8">blaze</span>, <span class="t8">to blow</span>, that is, <span class="t8">blossom</span>, <span class="t8">bloom</span>; and perhaps <span class="t8">blood</span> and <span class="t8">blush</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">In the native words of our tongue is to be found a great agreement between the letters and the thing signified; and therefore the sounds of the letters smaller, sharper, louder, closer, softer, stronger, clearer, more obscure, and more stridulous, do very often intimate the like effects in the things signified.</p>
<p class="p24">Thus words that begin with <span class="t8">str</span> intimate the force and effect of the thing signified, as if probably derived from στρωννυμι, or <span class="t8">strenuous</span>; as <span class="t8">strong</span>, <span class="t8">strength</span>, <span class="t8">strew</span>, <span class="t8">strike</span>, <span class="t8">streak</span>, <span class="t8">stroke</span>, <span class="t8">stripe</span>, <span class="t8">strive</span>, <span class="t8">strife</span>, <span class="t8">struggle</span>, <span class="t8">strout</span>, <span class="t8">strut</span>, <span class="t8">stretch</span>, <span class="t8">strait</span>, <span class="t8">strict</span>, <span class="t8">streight</span>, that is, narrow, <span class="t8">distrain</span>, <span class="t8">stress</span>, <span class="t8">distress</span>, <span class="t8">string</span>, <span class="t8">strap</span>, <span class="t8">stream</span>, <span class="t8">streamer</span>, <span class="t8">strand</span>, <span class="t8">strip</span>, <span class="t8">stray</span>, <span class="t8">struggle</span>, <span class="t8">strange</span>, <span class="t8">stride</span>, <span class="t8">stradale</span>.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">St</span> in like manner imply strength, but in a less degree, so much only as is sufficient to preserve what has been already communicated, rather than acquire any new degree; as if it were derived from the Latin <span class="t8">sto</span>; for example, <span class="t8">stand</span>, <span class="t8">stay</span>, that is, to remain, or to prop; <span class="t8">staff</span>, <span class="t8">stay</span>, that is, to oppose; <span class="t8">stop</span>, <span class="t8">to stuff</span>, <span class="t8">stifle</span>, <span class="t8">to stay</span>, that is, to stop; a <span class="t8">stay</span>, that is, an obstacle; <span class="t8">stick</span>, <span class="t8">stut</span>, <span class="t8">stutter</span>, <span class="t8">stammer</span>, <span class="t8">stagger</span>, <span class="t8">stickle</span>, <span class="t8">stick</span>, <span class="t8">stake</span>, a sharp, pale, and any thing deposited at play; <span class="t8">stock</span>, <span class="t8">stem</span>, <span class="t8">sting</span>, <span class="t8">to sting</span>, <span class="t8">stink</span>, <span class="t8">stitch</span>, <span class="t8">stud</span>, <span class="t8">stuncheon</span>, <span class="t8">stub</span>, <span class="t8">stubble</span>, to <span class="t8">stub</span> up, <span class="t8">stump</span>, whence <span class="t8">stumble</span>, <span class="t8">stalk</span>, <span class="t8">to stalk</span>, <span class="t8">step</span>, <span class="t8">to stamp</span> with the feet, whence to <span class="t8">stamp</span>, that is, to make an impression and a stamp; <span class="t8">stow</span>, <span class="t8">to stow</span>, <span class="t8">to bestow</span>, <span class="t8">steward</span>, or <span class="t8">stoward</span>; <span class="t8">stead</span>, <span class="t8">steady</span>, <span class="t8">stedfast</span>, <span class="t8">stable</span>, <span class="t8">a stable</span>, <span class="t8">a stall</span>, <span class="t8">to stall</span>, <span class="t8">stool</span>, <span class="t8">stall</span>, <span class="t8">still</span>, <span class="t8">stall</span>, <span class="t8">stallage</span>, <span class="t8">stage</span>, <span class="t8">still</span>, adjective, and <span class="t8">still</span>, adverb: <span class="t8">stale</span>, <span class="t8">stout</span>, <span class="t8">sturdy</span>, <span class="t8">stead</span>, <span class="t8">stoat</span>, <span class="t8">stallion</span>, <span class="t8">stiff</span>, <span class="t8">stark-dead</span>, <span class="t8">to starve</span> with hunger or cold; <span class="t8">stone</span>, <span class="t8">steel</span>, <span class="t8">stern</span>, <span class="t8">stanch</span>, <span class="t8">to stanch</span> blood, <span class="t8">to stare</span>, <span class="t8">steep</span>, <span class="t8">steeple</span>, <span class="t8">stair</span>, <span class="t8">standard</span>, a stated measure, <span class="t8">stately</span>. In all these, and perhaps some others, <span class="t8">st</span> denote something firm and fixed.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Thr</span> imply a more violent degree of motion, as <span class="t8">throw</span>, <span class="t8">thrust</span>, <span class="t8">throng</span>, <span class="t8">throb</span>, <span class="t8">through</span>, <span class="t8">threat</span>, <span class="t8">threaten</span>, <span class="t8">thrall</span>, <span class="t8">throws</span>.</p>

<p class="p24">And so likewise <span class="t8">ash</span>, in <span class="t8">crash</span>, <span class="t8">rash</span>, <span class="t8">gash</span>, <span class="t8">flash</span>, <span class="t8">clash</span>, <span class="t8">lash</span>, <span class="t8">slash</span>, <span class="t8">plash</span>, <span class="t8">trash</span>, indicate something acting more nimbly and sharply.

Yet in both there is indicated a swift and sudden motion not instantaneous, but gradual, by the continued sound, <span class="t8">sh</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">Thus in <span class="t8">fling</span>, <span class="t8">sling</span>, <span class="t8">ding</span>, <span class="t8">swing</span>, <span class="t8">cling</span>, <span class="t8">sing</span>, <span class="t8">wring</span>, <span class="t8">sting</span>, the tingling of the termination <span class="t8">ng</span>, and the sharpness of the vowel <span class="t8">i</span><a id="a1102"></a>, imply the continuation of a very slender motion or tremor, at length indeed vanishing, but not suddenly interrupted.&nbsp; But in <span class="t8">tink</span>, <span class="t8">wink</span>, <span class="t8">sink</span>, <span class="t8">clink</span>, <span class="t8">chink</span>, <span class="t8">think</span>, that end in a mute consonant, there is also indicated a sudden ending.</p>

And the same frequency of acts, but less subtile by reason of the clearer vowel <span class="t8">a</span>, is indicated in <span class="t8">jangle</span>, <span class="t8">tangle</span>, <span class="t8">spangle</span>, <span class="t8">mangle</span>, <span class="t8">wrangle</span>, <span class="t8">brangle</span>, <span class="t8">dangle</span>; as also in <span class="t8">mumble</span>, <span class="t8">grumble</span>, <span class="t8">jumble</span>. But at the same time the close <span class="t8">u</span> implies something obscure or obtunded; and a congeries of consonants <span class="t8">mbl</span>, denotes a confused kind of rolling or tumbling, as in <span class="t8">ramble</span>, <span class="t8">scamble</span>, <span class="t8">scramble</span>, <span class="t8">wamble</span>, <span class="t8">amble</span>; but in these there is something acute.</p>
<p class="p24">In <span class="t8">nimble</span>, the acuteness of the vowel denotes celerity. In <span class="t8">sparkle</span>, <span class="t8">sp</span> denotes dissipation, <span class="t8">ar</span> an acute crackling, <span class="t8">k</span> a sudden interruption, <span class="t8">l</span> a frequent iteration; and in like manner in <span class="t8">sprinkle</span>, unless <span class="t8">in</span> may imply the subtilty of the dissipated guttules. <span class="t8">Thick</span> and <span class="t8">thin</span> differ in that the former ends with an obtuse consonant, and the latter with an acute.</p>
<p class="p24">In like manner, in <span class="t8">squeek</span>, <span class="t8">squeak</span>, <span class="t8">squeal</span>, <span class="t8">squall</span>, <span class="t8">brawl</span>, <span class="t8">wraul</span>, <span class="t8">yaul</span>, <span class="t8">spaul</span>, <span class="t8">screek</span>, <span class="t8">shriek</span>, <span class="t8">shrill</span>, <span class="t8">sharp</span>, <span class="t8">shrivel</span>, <span class="t8">wrinkle</span>, <span class="t8">crack</span>, <span class="t8">crash</span>, <span class="t8">clash</span>, <span class="t8">gnash</span>, <span class="t8">plash</span>, <span class="t8">crush</span>, <span class="t8">hush</span>, <span class="t8">hisse</span>, <span class="t8">fisse</span>, <span class="t8">whist</span>, <span class="t8">soft</span>, <span class="t8">jar</span>, <span class="t8">hurl</span>, <span class="t8">curl</span>, <span class="t8">whirl</span>, <span class="t8">buz</span>, <span class="t8">bustle</span>, <span class="t8">spindle</span>, <span class="t8">dwindle</span>, <span class="t8">twine</span>, <span class="t8">twist</span>, and in many more, we may observe the agreement of such sort of sounds with the things signified; and this so frequently happens, that scarce any language which I know can be compared with ours. So that one monosyllable word, of which kind are almost all ours, emphatically expresses what in other languages can scarce be explained but by compounds, or decompounds, or sometimes a tedious circumlocution.</p>
<p class="p24">We have many words borrowed from the Latin; but the greatest part of them were communicated by the intervention of the French; as, <span class="t8">grace</span>, <span class="t8">face</span>, <span class="t8">elegant</span>, <span class="t8">elegance</span>, <span class="t8">resemble</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">Some verbs which seem borrowed from the Latin, are formed from the present tense, and some from the supines.</p>
<p class="p24">From the present are formed <span class="t8">spend</span>, <span class="t8">expend</span>, expendo; <span class="t8">conduce</span>, conduco; <span class="t8">despise</span>, despicio; <span class="t8">approve</span>, approbo; <span class="t8">conceive</span>, concipio.</p>
<p class="p24">From the supines, <span class="t8">supplicate</span>, supplico; <span class="t8">demonstrate</span>, demonstro; <span class="t8">dispose</span>, dispono; <span class="t8">expatiate</span>, expatior; <span class="t8">suppress</span>, supprimo; <span class="t8">exempt</span>, eximo.</p>
<p class="p24">Nothing is more apparent than that Wallis goes too far in quest of originals. Many of these which seem selected as immediate descendants from the Latin, are apparently French, as, <span class="t8">conceive</span>, <span class="t8">approve</span>, <span class="t8">expose</span>, <span class="t8">exempt</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">Some words purely French, not derived from the Latin, we have transferred into our language; as, <span class="t8">garden</span>, <span class="t8">garter</span>, <span class="t8">buckler</span>, <span class="t8">to advance</span>, <span class="t8">to cry</span>, <span class="t8">to plead</span>, from the French <span class="t8">jardin</span>, <span class="t8">jartier</span>, <span class="t8">bouclier</span>, <span class="t8">avancer</span>, <span class="t8">crier</span>, <span class="t8">plaider</span>; though, indeed, even of these part is of Latin original.</p>
<p class="p24">As to many words which we have in common with the Germans, it is doubtful whether the old Teutons borrowed them from the Latins, or the Latins from the Teutons, or both had them from some common original; as <span class="t8">wine</span>, vinum; <span class="t8">wind</span>, ventus; <span class="t8">went</span>, veni; <span class="t8">way</span>, via, <span class="t8">wall</span>, vallum; <span class="t8">wallow</span>, volvo; <span class="t8">wool</span>, vellus; <span class="t8">will</span>, volo; <span class="t8">worm</span>, vermis; <span class="t8">worth</span>, virtus; <span class="t8">wasp</span>, vespa; <span class="t8">day</span>, dies; <span class="t8">draw</span>, traho; <span class="t8">tame</span>, domo, δαμαω; <span class="t8">yoke</span>, jugum, ζευγος; <span class="t8">over</span>, <span class="t8">upper</span>, super, ‛υπερ; <span class="t8">am</span>, sum, ειμι; <span class="t8">break</span>, frango; <span class="t8">fly</span>, volo; <span class="t8">blow</span>, flo. I make no doubt but the Teutonick is more ancient than the Latin: and it is no less certain, that the Latin, which borrowed a great number of words not only from the Greek, especially the Æolick, but from other neighbouring languages, as the Oscan and others, which have long become obsolete, received not a few from the Teutonick. It is certain, that the English, German, and other Teutonick languages, retained some derived from the Greek, which the Latin has not; as, <span class="t8">ax</span>, <span class="t8">achs</span>, <span class="t8">mit</span>, <span class="t8">ford</span>, <span class="t8">pfurd</span>, <span class="t8">daughter</span>, <span class="t8">tochter</span>, <span class="t8">mickle</span>, <span class="t8">mingle</span>, <span class="t8">moon</span>, <span class="t8">sear</span>, <span class="t8">oar</span>, <span class="t8">grave</span>, <span class="t8">graff</span>, <span class="t8">to grave</span>, <span class="t8">to scrape</span>, <span class="t8">whole</span>, from αξινη, μετα, πορθμος, θυγατηρ, μεγαλος, μιγνυω, μηνη, ξηρος, γραφω, ‛ολος. Since they received these immediately from the Greeks, without the intervention of the Latin language, why may not other words be derived immediately from the same fountain, though they be likewise found among the Latins?</p>
<p class="p24">Our ancestors were studious to form borrowed words, however long, into monosyllables; and not only cut off the formative terminations, but cropped the first syllable, especially in words beginning with a vowel; and rejected not only vowels in the middle, but likewise consonants of a weaker sound, retaining the stronger, which seem the bones of words, or changing them for others of the same organ, in order that the sound might become the softer; but especially transposing their order, that they might the more readily be pronounced without the intermediate vowels. For example in expendo, <span class="t8">spend</span>; exemplum, <span class="t8">sample</span>; excipio, <span class="t8">scape</span>; extraneus, <span class="t8">strange</span>; extractum, <span class="t8">stretch&rsquo;d</span>; excrucio, <span class="t8">to screw</span>; exscorio, <span class="t8">to scour</span>; excorio, <span class="t8">to scourge</span>; excortico, <span class="t8">to scratch</span>; and others beginning with <span class="t8">ex</span>: as also, emendo, <span class="t8">to mend</span>; episcopus, <span class="t8">bishop</span>, in Danish <span class="t8">bisp</span>; epistola, <span class="t8">epistle</span>; hospitale, <span class="t8">spittle</span>; Hispania, <span class="t8">Spain</span>; historia, <span class="t8">story</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">Many of these etymologies are doubtful, and some evidently mistaken.</p>

<p class="p24">Some may seem harsher, yet may not be rejected, for it at least appears, that some of them are derived from proper names, and there are others whose etymology is acknowledged by every body; as, Alexander, <span class="t8">Elick</span>, <span class="t8">Scander</span>, <span class="t8">Sander</span>, <span class="t8">Sandy</span>, <span class="t8">Sanny</span>; Elizabetha, <span class="t8">Elizabeth</span>, <span class="t8">Elisabeth</span>, <span class="t8">Betty</span>, <span class="t8">Bess</span>; Margareta, <span class="t8">Margaret</span>, <span class="t8">Marget</span>, <span class="t8">Meg</span>, <span class="t8">Peg</span>; Maria, <span class="t8">Mary</span>, <span class="t8">Mal</span>, <span class="t8">Pal</span>, <span class="t8">Malkin</span>, <span class="t8">Mawkin</span>, <span class="t8">Mawkes</span>; Mathæus, <span class="t8">Mattha</span>, <span class="t8">Matthew</span>; Martha, <span class="t8">Mat</span>, <span class="t8">Pat</span>; Gulielmus, <span class="t8">Wilhelmus</span>, <span class="t8">Girolamo</span>, <span class="t8">Guillaume</span>, <span class="t8">William</span>, <span class="t8">Will</span>, <span class="t8">Bill</span>, <span class="t8">Wilkin</span>, <span class="t8">Wicken</span>, <span class="t8">Wicks</span>, <span class="t8">Weeks</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">Thus cariophyllus, flos; gerofilo, Italian, giriflee, gilofer, French, <span class="t8">gilliflower</span>, which the vulgar call <span class="t8">julyflower</span>, as if derived from the month <span class="t8">July</span>; petroselinum, <span class="t8">parsley</span>; portulaca, <span class="t8">purslain</span>; cydonium, <span class="t8">quince</span>; cydoniatum, <span class="t8">quiddeny</span>; persicum, <span class="t8">peach</span>; eruca, <span class="t8">eruke</span>, which they corrupt to <span class="t8">earwig</span>, as if it took its name from the ear; annulus geminus, <span class="t8">a gimmal</span>, or <span class="t8">gimbal-ring</span>; and thus the word <span class="t8">gimbal</span> or <span class="t8">jumbal</span> is transferred to other things thus interwoven; quelques choses, <span class="t8">kickshaws</span>. Since the origin of these, and many others, however forced, is evident, it ought to appear no wonder to any one if the ancients have thus disfigured many, especially as they so much affected monosyllables; and, to make the sound the softer, took this liberty of maiming, taking away, changing, transposing, and softening them.</p>
<p class="p24">But while we derive these from the Latin, I do not mean to say, that many of them did not immediately come to us from the Saxon, Danish, Dutch, and Teutonick languages, and other dialects; and some taken more lately from the French or Italians, or Spaniards.</p>
<p class="p24">The same word, according to its different significations, often has a different origin; as, <span class="t8">to bear a burden</span>, from <span class="t8">fero</span>; but <span class="t8">to bear</span>, whence <span class="t8">birth</span>, <span class="t8">born</span>, <span class="t8">bairn</span>, comes from <span class="t8">pario</span>; and <span class="t8">a bear</span>, at least if it be of Latin original, from <span class="t8">fera</span>. Thus <span class="t8">perch</span>, a fish, from <span class="t8">perca</span>; but <span class="t8">perch</span>, a measure, from <span class="t8">pertica</span>, and likewise <span class="t8">to perch</span>. To <span class="t8">spell</span> is from <span class="t8">syllaba</span>; but <span class="t8">spell</span>, an inchantment, by which it is believed that the boundaries are so fixed in lands that none can pass them against the master&rsquo;s will, from <span class="t8">expello</span>; and <span class="t8">spell</span>, a messenger, from <span class="t8">epistola</span>; whence <span class="t8">gospel</span>, <span class="t8">good-spell</span>, or <span class="t8">god-spell</span>. Thus <span class="t8">freese</span>, or <span class="t8">freeze</span>, from <span class="t8">frigesco</span>; but <span class="t8">freeze</span>, an architectonick word, from <span class="t8">zophorus</span>; but <span class="t8">freeze</span>, for <span class="t8">cloth</span>, from <span class="t8">Frisia</span>, or perhaps from <span class="t8">frigesco</span>, as being more fit than any other for keeping out the cold.</p>
<p class="p24">There are many words among us, even monosyllables, compounded of two or more words, at least serving instead of compounds, and comprising the signification of more words that one; as, from <span class="t8">scrip</span> and <span class="t8">roll</span> comes <span class="t8">scroll</span>; from <span class="t8">proud</span> and <span class="t8">dance</span>, <span class="t8">prance</span>; from <span class="t8">st</span> of the verb <span class="t8">stay</span> or <span class="t8">stand</span> and <span class="t8">out</span>, is made <span class="t8">stout</span>; from <span class="t8">stout</span> and <span class="t8">hardy</span>, <span class="t8">sturdy</span>; from <span class="t8">sp</span> of <span class="t8">spit</span> or <span class="t8">spew</span>, and <span class="t8">out</span>, comes <span class="t8">spout</span>; from the same <span class="t8">sp</span> with the termination <span class="t8">in</span>, is <span class="t8">spin</span>; and adding <span class="t8">out</span>, <span class="t8">spin out</span>: and from the same <span class="t8">sp</span>, with it, is <span class="t8">spit</span>, which only differs from <span class="t8">spout</span> in that it is smaller, and with less noise and force; but <span class="t8">sputter</span> is, because of the obscure <span class="t8">u</span>, something between <span class="t8">spit</span> and <span class="t8">spout</span>: and by reason of adding <span class="t8">r</span>, it intimates a frequent iteration and noise, but obscurely confused; whereas <span class="t8">spatter</span>, on account of the sharper and clearer vowel <span class="t8">a</span>, intimates a more distinct poise, in which it chiefly differs from <span class="t8">sputter</span>. From the same <span class="t8">sp</span> and the termination <span class="t8">ark</span>, comes <span class="t8">spark</span>, signifying a single emission of fire with a noise; namely <span class="t8">sp</span>, the emission, <span class="t8">ar</span>, the more acute noise, and <span class="t8">k</span>, the mute consonant, intimates its being suddenly terminated; but adding <span class="t8">l</span>, is made the frequentative <span class="t8">sparkle</span>. The same <span class="t8">sp</span>, by adding <span class="t8">r</span>, that is <span class="t8">spr</span>, implies a more lively impetus of diffusing or expanding itself; to which adding the termination <span class="t8">ing</span>, it becomes <span class="t8">spring</span>: its vigour <span class="t8">spr</span> imports; its sharpness the termination <span class="t8">ing</span>; and lastly <span class="t8">in</span> acute and tremulous, ending in the mute consonant <span class="t8">g</span>, denotes the sudden ending of any motion, that it is meant in its primary signification, of a single, not a complicated exilition. Hence we call <span class="t8">spring</span> whatever has an elastick force; as also a fountain of water, and thence the origin of any thing: and to <span class="t8">spring</span>, to germinate, and <span class="t8">spring</span>, one of the four seasons. From the same <span class="t8">spr</span> and <span class="t8">out</span>, is formed sprout, and wit the termination <span class="t8">ig</span>, <span class="t8">sprig</span>; of which the following, for the most part, is the difference: <span class="t8">sprout</span>, of a grosser sound, imports a fatter or grosser bud; <span class="t8">sprig</span>, of a slenderer sound, denotes a smaller shoot. In like manner, from <span class="t8">str</span> of the verb <span class="t8">strive</span>, and <span class="t8">out</span>, comes <span class="t8">strout</span>, and <span class="t8">strut</span>. From the same <span class="t8">str</span>, and the termination <span class="t8">uggle</span>, is made <span class="t8">struggle</span>; and this <span class="t8">gl</span> imports, but without any great noise, by reason of the obscure sound of the vowel <span class="t8">u</span>. In like manner, from <span class="t8">throw</span> and <span class="t8">roll</span> is made <span class="t8">troll</span>, and almost in the same sense is <span class="t8">trundle</span>, from <span class="t8">throw</span> or <span class="t8">thrust</span>, and <span class="t8">rundle</span>. Thus <span class="t8">graff</span> or <span class="t8">grough</span> is compounded of <span class="t8">grave</span> and <span class="t8">rough</span>; and <span class="t8">trudge</span> from <span class="t8">tread</span> or <span class="t8">trot</span>, and <span class="t8">drudge</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">In these observations it is easy to discover great sagacity and great extravagance, an ability to do much defeated by the desire of doing more than enough. It may be remarked,</p>
<p class="p24">1. That Wallis&rsquo;s derivations are often so made, that by the same license any language may be deduced from any other.</p>
<p class="p24"><a id="a1104"></a>2. That he makes no distinction between words immediately derived by us from the Latin, and those which being copied from other languages, can therefore afford no example of the genius of&nbsp; the English language, or its laws of derivation.</p>
<p class="p24">3. That he derives from the Latin, often with great harshness and violence, words apparently Teutonick; and therefore, according to his own declaration, probably older than the tongue to which he refers them.</p>
<p class="p24">4. That some of his derivations are apparently erroneous.</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">SYNTAX.</span></p>
<p class="p21">The established practice of grammarians requires that I should here treat of the Syntax; but our language has so little inflection, or variety of terminations, that its construction neither requires nor admits many rules. Wallis, therefore, has totally neglected it; and Jonson, whose desire of following the writers upon the learned languages made him think a syntax indispensably necessary, has published such petty observations as were better omitted.</p>
<p class="p24">The verb, as in other languages, agrees with the nominative in number and person; as, <span class="t8">Thou fliest from good</span>; <span class="t8">He runs to death</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">Our adjectives and pronouns are invariable.</p>
<p class="p24">Of two substantives the noun possessive is in the genitive; as, <span class="t8">His father&rsquo;s glory</span>; <span class="t8">The sun&rsquo;s heat</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">Verbs transitive require an oblique case; as, <span class="t8">He loves me</span>; <span class="t8">You fear him</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">All prepositions require an oblique case: as, <span class="t8">He gave this</span> to <span class="t8">me</span>; <span class="t8">He took this</span> from <span class="t8">me</span>; <span class="t8">He says this</span> of <span class="t8">me</span>; <span class="t8">He came</span> with <span class="t8">me</span>.</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">PROSODY.</span></p>
<p class="p21">It is common for those that deliver the grammar of modern languages, to omit the Prosody. So that of the Italians is neglected by Buomattei; that of the French by Desmarais; aad that of the English by Wallis, Cooper, and even by Jonson, though a poet. But as the laws of metre are included in the idea of grammar, I have thought proper to insert them.</p>
<p class="p24">PROSODY comprises <span class="t8">orthoepy</span>, or the rules of pronunciation; and <span class="t8">orthometry</span>, or the laws of versification.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Pronunciation</span> is just, when every letter has its proper sound, and every syllable has its proper accent, or, which in English versification is the same, its proper quantity.</p>
<p class="p24">The sounds of the letters have been already explained; and rules for the accent or quantity are not easily to be given, being subject to innumerable exceptions. Such, however, as I have read or formed, I shall here propose.</p>
<p class="p24">1. Of dissyllables, formed by affixing a termination, the former syllable is commonly accented, as <span class="t8">chíldish</span>, <span class="t8">kíngdom</span>, <span class="t8">áctest</span>, <span class="t8">ácted</span>, <span class="t8">tóilsome</span>, <span class="t8">lóver</span>, <span class="t8">scóffer</span>, <span class="t8">faírer</span>, <span class="t8">fóremost</span>, <span class="t8">zéalous</span>, <span class="t8">fúlness</span>, <span class="t8">gódly</span>, <span class="t8">meékly</span>, <span class="t8">ártist</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">2. Dissyllables formed by prefixing a syllable to the radical word, have commonly the accent on the latter; as to <span class="t8">begét</span>, to <span class="t8">beseém</span>, to <span class="t8">bestów</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">3. Of dissyllables, which are at once nouns and verbs, the verb has commonly the accent on the latter, and the noun on the former syllable; as, <span class="t8">to descánt</span>, <span class="t8">a déscant</span>; <span class="t8">to cemént</span>, <span class="t8">a cément</span>; <span class="t8">to contráct</span>, <span class="t8">a cóntract</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">This rule has many exceptions. Though verbs seldom have their accent on the former, yet nouns often have it on the latter syllable; as <span class="t8">delíght</span>, <span class="t8">perfúme</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">4. All dissyllables ending in <span class="t8">y</span>, as <span class="t8">cránny</span>; in <span class="t8">our</span>, as <span class="t8">lábour</span>, <span class="t8">fávour</span>; in <span class="t8">ow</span>, as <span class="t8">wíllow</span>, <span class="t8">wállow</span>, except <span class="t8">allów</span>; in <span class="t8">le</span>, as <span class="t8">báttle</span>, <span class="t8">bíble</span>; in <span class="t8">ish</span>, as <span class="t8">bánish</span>; in <span class="t8">ck</span>, as <span class="t8">cámbrick</span>, <span class="t8">cássock</span>; in <span class="t8">ter</span>, as <span class="t8">to bátter</span>; in <span class="t8">age</span>, as <span class="t8">coúrage</span>, in <span class="t8">en</span>, as <span class="t8">fásten</span>; in <span class="t8">et</span>, as <span class="t8">quíet</span>; accent the former syllable.</p>
<p class="p24">5. Dissyllable nouns in <span class="t8">er</span>, as <span class="t8">cánker</span>, <span class="t8">bútter</span>, have the accent on the former syllable.</p>
<p class="p24">6. Dissyllable verbs terminating in a consonant and <span class="t8">e</span> final, as <span class="t8">compríse</span>, <span class="t8">escápe</span>; or having a diphthong in the last syllable, as <span class="t8">appéase</span>, <span class="t8">revéal</span>; or ending in two consonants, as <span class="t8">atténd</span>; have the accent on the latter syllable.</p>
<p class="p24">7. Dissyllable nouns having a diphthong in the latter syllable, have commonly their accent on the latter syllable, as <span class="t8">appláuse</span>; except words in <span class="t8">ain</span>, <span class="t8">cértain</span>, <span class="t8">moúntain</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">8. Trissyllables formed by adding a termination, or prefixing a syllable, retain the accent of the radical word; as, <span class="t8">lóveliness</span>, <span class="t8">ténderness</span>, <span class="t8">contémner</span>, <span class="t8">wágonner</span>, <span class="t8">phýsical</span>, <span class="t8">bespátter</span>, <span class="t8">cómmenting</span>, <span class="t8">comménding</span>, <span class="t8">assúrance</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">9. Trissyllables ending in <span class="t8">ous</span>, as <span class="t8">grácious</span>, <span class="t8">árduous</span>; in <span class="t8">al</span>, as <span class="t8">cápital</span>; in <span class="t8">ion</span>, as <span class="t8">méntion</span>; accent the first.</p>
<p class="p24">10. Trissyllables ending in <span class="t8">ce</span>, <span class="t8">ent</span>, and <span class="t8">ate</span>, accent the first syllable, as <span class="t8">cóuntenance</span>, <span class="t8">cóntinence</span>, <span class="t8">ármament</span>, <span class="t8">ímminent</span>, <span class="t8">élegant</span>, <span class="t8">própagate</span>, except they be derived from words having the accent on the last, as <span class="t8">connívance</span>, <span class="t8">acquáintance</span>; or the middle syllable hath a vowel before two consonants, as <span class="t8">promúlgate</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">11. Trissyllables ending in <span class="t8">y</span>, as <span class="t8">éntity</span>, <span class="t8">spécify</span>, <span class="t8">líberty</span>, <span class="t8">víctory</span>, <span class="t8">súbsidy</span>, commonly accent the first syllable.</p>
<p class="p24">12. Trissyllables in <span class="t8">re</span> or <span class="t8">le</span><a id="a1105"></a> accent the&nbsp; first syllable, as <span class="t8">légible</span>, <span class="t8">théatre</span>, except <span class="t8">discíple</span>, and some words which have a position, as <span class="t8">exámple</span>, <span class="t8">epístle</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">13. Trissyllables in <span class="t8">ude</span> commonly accent the first syllable, as <span class="t8">plénitude</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">14. Trissyllables ending in <span class="t8">ator</span> or <span class="t8">atour</span>, as <span class="t8">creátour</span>; or having in the middle syllable a diphthong, as <span class="t8">endeávour</span>; or a vowel before two consonants, as <span class="t8">doméstick</span>; accent the middle syllable.</p>
<p class="p24">15. Trissyllables that have their accent on the last syllable are commonly French, as <span class="t8">acquiésce</span>, <span class="t8">repartée</span>, <span class="t8">magazíne</span>, or words formed by prefixing one or two syllables to an acute syllable, as <span class="t8">immatúre</span>, <span class="t8">overchárge</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">16. Polysyllables, or words of more than three syllables, follow the accent of the words from which they are derived, as <span class="t8">árrogating</span>, <span class="t8">cóntinency</span>, <span class="t8">incóntinently</span>, <span class="t8">comméndable</span>, <span class="t8">commúnicableness</span>. We should therefore say <span class="t8">dispútable</span>, <span class="t8">indispútable</span>; rather than <span class="t8">dísputable</span>, <span class="t8">indísputable</span>; and <span class="t8">advertísement</span>, rather than <span class="t8">advértisement</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">17. Words in <span class="t8">ion</span> have the accent upon the antepenult, as <span class="t8">salvátion</span>, <span class="t8">perturbátion</span>, <span class="t8">concóction</span>; words in <span class="t8">atour</span> or <span class="t8">ator</span> on the penult, as <span class="t8">dedicátor</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">18. Words ending in <span class="t8">le</span> commonly have the accent on the first syllable, as <span class="t8">ámicable</span>, unless the second syllable have a vowel before two consonants, as <span class="t8">combústible</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">19. Words ending in <span class="t8">ous</span> have the accents on the antepenult, as <span class="t8">uxórious</span>, <span class="t8">volúptuous</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">20. Words ending in <span class="t8">ty</span> have their accent on the antepenult, as <span class="t8">pusillanímity</span>, <span class="t8">actívity</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">These rules are not advanced as complete or infallible, but proposed as useful. Almost every rule of every language has its exceptions; and in English, as in other tongues, much must be learned by example and authority. Perhaps more and better rules may be given that have escaped my observation.</p>
<p class="p24">VERSIFICATION is the arrangement of a certain number of syllables according to certain laws.</p>
<p class="p24">The feet of our verses are either iambick, as <span class="t8">alóft</span>, <span class="t8">creáte</span>; or trochaick, as <span class="t8">hóly</span>, <span class="t8">lófty</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">Our iambick measure comprises verses</p>
<p class="p24">Of four syllables,</p>
<p class="p24">Most good, most fair,</p>
<p class="p24">Or things as rare,</p>
<p class="p24">To call you&rsquo;s lost;</p>
<p class="p24">For all the cost</p>
<p class="p24">Words can bestow,</p>
<p class="p24">So poorly show</p>
<p class="p24">Upon your praise,</p>
<p class="p24">That all the ways</p>
<p class="p24">Sense hath, come short. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="t8">Drayton.</span></p>
<p class="p24">With ravish&rsquo;d ears</p>
<p class="p24">The monarch hears. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="t8">Dryden.</span></p>
<p class="p24">Of six,</p>
<p class="p24">This while we are abroad,</p>
<p class="p24">Shall we not touch our lyre?</p>
<p class="p24">Shall we not sing an ode?</p>
<p class="p24">Or shall that holy fire,</p>
<p class="p24">In us that strongly glow&rsquo;d,</p>
<p class="p24">In this cold air expire?</p>
<p class="p24">Though in the utmost peak,</p>
<p class="p24">A while we do remain,</p>
<p class="p24">Amongst the mountains bleak,</p>
<p class="p24">Expos&rsquo;d to sleet and rain,</p>
<p class="p24">No sport our hours shall break,</p>
<p class="p24">To exercise our vein.</p>
<p class="p24">What though bright Phœbus&rsquo; beams</p>
<p class="p24">Refresh the southern ground,</p>
<p class="p24">And though the princely Thames</p>
<p class="p24">With beauteous nymphs abound,</p>
<p class="p24">And by old Camber&rsquo;s streams</p>
<p class="p24">Be many wonders found:</p>
<p class="p24">Yet many rivers clear</p>
<p class="p24">Here glide in silver swathes,</p>
<p class="p24">And what of all most dear,</p>
<p class="p24">Buxton&rsquo;s delicious baths,</p>
<p class="p24">Strong ale and noble chear,</p>
<p class="p24">T&rsquo; asswage breem winters scathes.</p>
<p class="p24">In places far or near,</p>
<p class="p24">Or famous, or obscure,</p>
<p class="p24">Where wholsom is the air,</p>
<p class="p24">Or where the most impure,</p>
<p class="p24">All times, and every where,</p>
<p class="p24">The muse is still in ure. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="t8">Drayton.</span></p>
<p class="p24">Of eight, which is the usual measure for short poems,</p>
<p class="p24">And may at last my weary age</p>
<p class="p24">Find out the peaceful hermitage,</p>
<p class="p24">The hairy gown, and mossy cell,</p>
<p class="p24">Where I may sit, and nightly spell</p>
<p class="p24">Of ev&rsquo;ry star the sky doth shew,</p>
<p class="p24">And ev&rsquo;ry herb that sips the dew. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="t8">Milton.</span></p>
<p class="p24">Of ten, which is the common measure of heroick and tragick poetry,</p>
<p class="p24">Full in the midst of this created space,</p>
<p class="p24">Betwixt heav&rsquo;n, earth, and skies, there stands a place</p>
<p class="p24">Confining on all three; with triple bound;</p>
<p class="p24">Whence all things, though remote, are view&rsquo;d around,</p>
<p class="p24">And thither bring their undulating sound.</p>
<p class="p24">The palace of loud Fame, her seat of pow&rsquo;r,</p>
<p class="p24">Plac&rsquo;d on the summit of a lofty tow&rsquo;r;</p>
<p class="p24">A thousand winding entries long and wide</p>
<p class="p24">Receive of fresh reports a flowing tide.</p>
<p class="p24">A thousand crannies in the walls are made;</p>
<p class="p24">Nor gate nor bars exclude the busy trade.</p>
<p class="p24">Tis built of brass, the better to diffuse</p>
<p class="p24">The spreading sounds, and multiply the news;</p>
<p class="p24">Where echoes in repeated echoes play:</p>
<p class="p24">A mart for ever full; and open night and day.</p>
<p class="p24">Nor silence is within, nor voice express,</p>
<p class="p24">But a deaf noise of sounds that never cease;</p>
<p class="p24">Confus&rsquo;d and chiding, like the hollow roar</p>
<p class="p24">Of tides, receding from th&rsquo; insulted shore;</p>
<p class="p24">Or like the broken thunder heard from far,</p>
<p class="p24">When Jove to distance drives the rolling war.</p>
<p class="p24">The courts are fill&rsquo;d with a tumultuous din,</p>
<p class="p24">Of crouds, or issuing forth, or ent&rsquo;ring in:</p>
<p class="p24">A thorough-fare of news; where some devise</p>
<p class="p24">Things never heard, some mingle truth with lies:</p>
<p class="p24">The troubled air with empty sounds they beat,</p>
<p class="p24">Intent to hear, and eager to repeat. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="t8">Dryden.</span></p>
<p class="p24">In all these measures the accents are to be placed on even syllables; and every line considered by itself is more harmonious, as this rule is more strictly observed. The variations necessary to pleasure belong to the art of poetry, not the rules of grammar.</p>
<p class="p24">Our trochaick measures are Of three syllables,</p>
<p class="p24">Here we may</p>
<p class="p24">Think and pray,</p>
<p class="p24">Before death</p>
<p class="p24">Stops our breath:</p>
<p class="p24">Other joys</p>
<p class="p24">Are but toys. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="t8">Walton&rsquo;s Angler.</span></p>
<p class="p24">Of five,</p>
<p class="p24">In the days of old,</p>
<p class="p24">Stories plainly told,</p>
<p class="p24">Lovers felt annoy. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="t8">Old Ballad.</span></p>
<p class="p24">Of seven,</p>
<p class="p24">Fairest piece of well form&rsquo;d earth,</p>
<p class="p24">Urge not thus your haughty birth. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="t8">Waller.</span></p>
<p class="p24">In these measures the accent is to be placed on the odd syllables.</p>
<p class="p24">These are the measures which are now in use, and above the rest those of seven, eight, and ten syllables. Our ancient poets wrote verses sometimes of twelve syllables, as Drayton&rsquo;s Polyolbion.</p>
<p class="p24">Of all the Cambrian shires their heads that bear so high,</p>
<p class="p24">And farth&rsquo;st survey their soils with an ambitious eye,</p>
<p class="p24">Mervinia for her hills, as for their matchless crouds,</p>
<p class="p24">The nearest that are said to kiss the wand&rsquo;ring clouds,</p>
<p class="p24">Especial audience craves, offended with the throng,</p>
<p class="p24">That she of all the rest neglected was so long;</p>
<p class="p24">Alledging for herself, when, through the Saxons&rsquo; pride,</p>
<p class="p24">The godlike race of Brute to Severn&rsquo;s setting side</p>
<p class="p24">Were cruelly inforc&rsquo;d, her mountains did relieve</p>
<p class="p24">Those whom devouring war else every where did grieve.</p>
<p class="p24">And when all Wales beside (by fortune or by might)</p>
<p class="p24">Unto her ancient foe resign&rsquo;d her ancient right,</p>
<p class="p24">A constant maiden still she only did remain,</p>
<p class="p24">The last her genuine laws which stoutly did retain.</p>
<p class="p24">And as each one is prais&rsquo;d for her peculiar things;</p>
<p class="p24">So only she is rich, in mountains, meres and springs,</p>
<p class="p24">And holds herself as great in her superfluous waste,</p>
<p class="p24">As others by their towns, and fruitful tillage grac&rsquo;d.</p>
<p class="p24">And of fourteen, as Chapman&rsquo;s Homer.</p>
<p class="p24">And as the mind of such a man, that hath a long way gone,</p>
<p class="p24">And either knoweth not his way, or else would let alone,</p>
<p class="p24">His purpos&rsquo;d journey, is distract.</p>
<p class="p24">The measures of twelve and fourteen syllables were often mingled by our old poets, sometimes in alternate lines, and sometimes in alternate couplets.</p>
<p class="p24">The verse of twelve syllables, called an <span class="t8">Alexandrine</span>, is now only used to diversify heroick lines.</p>
<p class="p24">Waller was smooth, but Dryden taught to join</p>
<p class="p24">The varying verse, the full resounding line,</p>
<p class="p24">The long majestick march, and energy divine. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="t8">Pope.</span></p>
<p class="p24">The pause in the Alexandrine must be at the sixth syllable.</p>
<p class="p24">The verse of fourteen syllables is now broken into a soft lyrick measure of verses, consisting alternately of eight syllables and six.</p>
<p class="p24">She to receive thy radiant name,</p>
<p class="p24">Selects a whiter space. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="t8">Fenton.</span></p>
<p class="p24">When all shall praise, and ev&rsquo;ry lay</p>
<p class="p24">Devote a wreath to thee,</p>
<p class="p24">That day, for come it will, that day</p>
<p class="p24">Shall I lament to see. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="t8">Lewis to Pope.</span></p>
<p class="p24">Beneath this tomb an infant lies</p>
<p class="p24">To earth whose body lent,</p>
<p class="p24">Hereafter shall more glorious rise,</p>
<p class="p24">But not more innocent.</p>
<p class="p24">When the Archangel&rsquo;s trump shall blow,</p>
<p class="p24">And souls to bodies join,</p>
<p class="p24">What crowds shall wish their lives below</p>
<p class="p24">Had been as short as thine! &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="t8">Wesley.</span></p>
<p class="p24">We have another measure very quick and lively, and therefore much used in songs, which may be called the <span class="t8">anapestick</span>, in which the accent rests upon every third syllable.</p>
<p class="p24">May I góvern my pássions with ábsolute swáy,</p>
<p class="p24">And grow wíser and bétter as lífe wears awáy. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="t8">Dr. Pope.</span></p>
<p class="p24">In this measure a syllable is often retrenched from the first foot, as</p>
<p class="p24">Diógenes súrly and próud. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="t8">Dr. Pope.</span></p>
<p class="p24">When présent, we lóve, and when ábsent agrée,</p>
<p class="p24">I thínk not of Íris, nor Íris of me. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="t8">Dryden.</span></p>
<p class="p24">These measures are varied by many combinations, and sometimes by double endings, either with or without rhyme, as in the heroick measure.</p>
<p class="p24">&rsquo;Tis the divinity that stirs <span class="t8">within us</span>,</p>
<p class="p24">&rsquo;Tis heaven itself that points out <span class="t8">an hereafter</span>,</p>
<p class="p24">And intimates eternity to man. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="t8">Addison.</span></p>
<p class="p24">So in that of eight syllables,</p>
<p class="p24">They neither added nor confounded,</p>
<p class="p24">They neither wanted nor abounded. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="t8">Prior.</span></p>
<p class="p24">In that of seven,</p>
<p class="p24">For resistance I could fear none,</p>
<p class="p24">But with twenty ships had done,</p>
<p class="p24">What thou, brave and happy Vernon,</p>
<p class="p24">Hast atchiev&rsquo;d with six alone. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="t8">Glover.</span></p>
<p class="p24">In that of six,</p>
<p class="p24">&rsquo;Twas when the seas were roaring,</p>
<p class="p24">With hollow blasts of wind,</p>
<p class="p24">A damsel lay deploring,</p>
<p class="p24">All on a rock reclin&rsquo;d. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="t8">Gay.</span></p>
<p class="p24">In the anapestick,</p>
<p class="p24">When terrible tempests assail us.</p>
<p class="p24">And mountainous billows affright,</p>
<p class="p24">Nor power nor wealth can avail us,</p>
<p class="p24">But skilful industry steers right. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="t8">Ballad.</span></p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p24">To these measures and their laws, may be reduced every species of English verse.</p>
<p class="p24">Our versification admits of few licences, except a <span class="t8">synalœpha</span>, or elision of <span class="t8">e</span> in <span class="t8">the</span> before a vowel, as <span class="t8">th&rsquo; eternal</span>; and more rarely of <span class="t8">o</span> in <span class="t8">to</span>, as <span class="t8">t&rsquo; accept</span>; and a <span class="t8">synaresis</span>, by which two short vowels coalesce into one syllable, as <span class="t8">question</span>, <span class="t8">special</span>; or a word is contracted by the expulsion of a short vowel before a liquid, as <span class="t8">av&rsquo;rice</span>, <span class="t8">temp&rsquo;rance</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">Thus have I collected rules and examples, by which the English language may be learned, if the reader be already acquainted with grammatical terms, or taught by a master to those that are more ignorant. To have written a grammar for such as are not yet initiated in the schools, would have been tedious, and perhaps at last ineffectual.</p>
