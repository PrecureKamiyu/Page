       <h2>Learning Japanese</h2>
       <p>One should realize that the way of learning is arbitrary. Others' advice may be a piece of shit to you.</p>
       <h2>Japanese in \(\bf\TeX\)</h2>
       <p>
       pTeX is invented for typesetting Japanese. And UpTeX is the extended version of pTeX. Both of them may have been viewed 
       as Legacy for typesetting Japanese for LuaTeX is doing a pretty good job. 
       </p>
       <p>
       Before you try to formatting some Japanese yourself, you may want to check out for this article about <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/jlreq/?lang=en">jlreq</a> (and <a href="https://github.com/abenori/jlreq" target="_blank">this one</a> for further information). Basically, it tells about the standard when formatting Japanese. You may skip it since it is too long. Anyway, you need to know that there is such thing as jlreq. 
       </p>
       <p>You may begin with a simple <code>.tex</code> file</p>
       <pre><code><!--
-->         \documentclass{jlreq}
	\begin{document}
	こんにちは。
	\end{document}</code></pre>
       <p>And compile the <code>.tex</code> file with <code>uplatex</code>. And you will get a <code>.dvi</code> file, whose name stands for "device independent", which is one of the feature of <code>.pdf</code> file, since it is designed that the same thing is displayed even on different devices and you may guess that <code>.dvi</code> plays the similar role before <code>.pdf</code> is born. Stupid Japanese use it because they can, for their devices haven't been renewed for decades. Your device already have been installed with <code>.dvi</code> reader if you have installed TeX Live. 
       A tool <code>dvipdfmx</code> is also installed which is used to, as its name has shown, to convert <code>.dvi</code> file into a <code>.pdf</code> file. You may run <code>dvipdfmx foo.dvi</code> to get a <code>.pdf</code> file.</p>
       <p>However, things get interesting when you try to open the output file, viz., the <code>.dvi</code> file: you just can't open it, or you may be able to open it since there could be something wrong with my device. Anyway, what is happening is that <code>.dvi</code> file does not have the information of font. When <code>uplatex</code> compile the <code>.tex</code> file, it use 
       <code>.dvi</code> file to store information including the position of the characters, but not the specific font that would be displayed. It is later that <code>dvipdfmx</code> map the font to <code>.pdf</code>. And further more, you can actually change the font not by changing the <code>.tex</code> file, but by applying an additional map together with <code>dvipdfmx</code>. </p>
       <p>Consequently, you can formatting Hanzi using upLaTeX. And there is vertical typesetting mode in upLaTeX. For <code>jlreq</code> class, just add parameter <code>tate</code> to the document class, viz., <code>\documentclass[tate]{jlreq}</code>. Thus you can formatting Hanzi vertically (after reading LdBeth's <a href="https://ldbeth.github.io/2017/03/29/uplatex/" target="_blank">article</a>). </p>
       <p>Awesome.</p>
       <p>But, it is possible that the font you need is not installed on your device. In my case, <code>.ttf</code> font is needed. If you have the similar problem, please check <a href="https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/618457933" target="_blank">an article in Zhihu.</a> about how to install a true type font and make TeX Live regonize it.</p>
