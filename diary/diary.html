<p>这里是中文，很少见的中文。首先，好久不见，日记。我有点想通了，就是前面的这些，关于如何看待这段 relationship 的事情。</p>
<p>我越想越恶心。可能她并没有预料到这一点吧。指不定还在洋洋得意，觉得自己处理得非常好。</p>
<p>
    下面我将省略“在我看来”和“我认为”这两种说辞。应当指出，她的种种表达“爱意”的做法实际上都是些令人作呕的、令人感到遗憾的、可悲的自我催眠的仪式。
    为了消除这种一开始就已经存在的、不能抑制住的、这种怀疑感和不笃定感，采取的行为仅仅是一种自我欺骗：说出笃定的话，就显得我笃定了吧，说不定就能真正变得笃定了吧。
    但是在这里并不是“fake it till make it”的达观。“make it”的愿望甚至并不存在。
</p>
<p>
    在这里难道问题不是很大吗？不由自主的说出一些根本办不到的事情，是为什么呢？
    实际上她在这里仅仅是自私的自说自话罢了、安慰自己罢了，可是就连安慰这种事情都没有做到。

    当意识到这些话的对象并不是自己的时候，我感觉像是吃了苍蝇一般。当然，这里还有辩解的空间，“我的话当然是真心的”，“并不是只对着自己说的”，好吧，这样的置信也不赖。
    在她那里，不笃定的感觉加深。等到加深到受不了的时候，就提出了分手。或许这里她还松了一口气，或许是这种积累的东西被放下了， 随后这种表露出的轻快的语气真是让人火大。
    真好，谁都没有受伤。擅自踏进来又擅自离开。原来还有这样方便的事情。
</p>
<p>
    还是太老中了。还以为自己为你着想，为未来着想。这里只不过是一种幼稚地对实现做出的判断所引出的、实际上只是为了自己而做出“解决方案”而已。

<h1>Jun 27</h1>
<p>Anyway, I am going to finish experiment one today. Suck my dick. What is remaining is the div command. Shit homie.</p>
<p>I am feeling great right now, to be honest. Hope she can see this diary right here.</p>
<p>I don't want to be so oldish, but that is right, I don't know what the fuck is love, but I do know that I like her and I need her. Maybe too childish but shit whatever. Okay maybe I don't need her, I don't need anyone.</p>
<br>
<p>And i kept thinking about something like... shit bro this can't be expressed in English. Sucks. Anyway, the thought here is suit for an article. wait for it my friend. Here is supposed to be emotional thing, not that kind of thing you know.</p>

<h1>Jun 26</h1>
<p>Yo bro. I didn't text her. What a crap.</p>
<p>26 is a busy day. I mean, was a busy day. Anyway, I went to the shixi and then went to experiment. Sitting there for about seven hours. I never felt this alive before.</p>
<p>Text her. Not gonna happen. At least for these days.</p>

<h1>Jun 25</h1>
<p>Hi, this is 25. What a shit day.</p>
<p>Yeah, people may be more honest when using another language to express their feeling</p>
<p>Anyway, is it possible that she still likes me and it is just because the relationship is not going to end good that she made the decision?</p>
<p>Another anyway, I am going to message her. Shit, bro. There is no such thing as moving on. I need her, bro.</p>

<h1>Jun 24</h1>
<p>EVA. Come and watch eva!</p>
<p>Man!</p>

<br>
<p>Man! You know what? What I want is just a "you can make it" ok? If one asks me "hey can you do it?" and I answer it, then it is a commitment. Am I going to make a commitment? Going to make a promise? Not a chance bro. People (like me) are afraid of commitment.</p>
<p>I don't say things like "I can make it". I am afraid. Afraid of not keeping the promise, 'cause I just don't know if I can do it. I achieved nothing in my life. I just can't get any confidence. Why don't you just realize that? And How are you going to ask a man (shitty as me) to keep a promise even though no others but god knows if he can make it?</p>
<p>What I do consistently are only eating, sleeping, jerking. How on earth does such a loser to get over those barrier? Okay, maybe I can. Just I don't believe it.</p>
<p>I even don't believe what I have said. Is it just a lie or nothing but reality? I don't fucking know!</p>
<p>Man! A loser should not develop a relationship with other.</p>

<h1>Jun 23</h1>
<p>I just broke up with gf. The relationship last for just two months. Crap. Maybe it is because the summer has come; the spring has passed. But she is in winter right now. What the fuck does that have to do with the season? We are not even in the same season. Fucker.</p>
<p>I should talk to someone about it. I don't know. I am feeling worse. I don't know how she feels. Maybe she just let out a sigh and felt so relieved. The relationship is a burden to her, that is what I have perceived. But what about me? I don't feel good.</p>
<p>Why not try caring about how I feel? I am (at least I think I am) a disabled, mentally, I guess. My life is incomplete. I have no friend. I don't enjoy games. I don't do well in school. I barely talk to my parents. I don't talk to my brother. I don't have a friendship with my roommates. I don't learn what I want to learn. I don't do thing that I like to do. I find no fun in my life. I hardly express my feeling. I don't feel like being a human. I feel so disabled. I am so disabled.</p>
<p>Gosh. At least for one time, I have something that is complete, that completes me (at least my life). Maybe she doesn't know how I feel. I feel terrible. It just because I pretend the thing I dislike does not exists that I can live my day.</p>
<p>What does relationship or koi mean to people? I think that is the question right now. A relationship means the future, means the life of a couple or it means a couple running a marriage for dozens of years.</p>
<p>But to me, it is just a chance to be normal people. To be a human! What the fuck are humans? I don't fucking know.</p>
<p>I just don't know.</p>
<p>Why don't you just fucking save me?</p>
<p>I can't do anything. I don't have confidence. So why can't you just care more about me instead of the fucking future?</p>
<p>When I was thinking "at least, I have another reason (a good reason) not to kill myself", I wasn't thinking about future. I can't think about the future. What am I supposed to do when I think about the future, if I can't do anything?</p>
<p>How did I know if I could do anything? What if the truth is "I think I can't do anything" but not "I can't anything"? Idk man. I am disabled. Why are you expecting such things from a disabled. And you just leave me alone, leave a disabled alone?</p>
<p>Sucks</p>


<h1>May 13</h1>
<p>What should be contained in the diary? I don't know. But I think that one takes diary to
    write thing that happened in that day. It is indeed useless to just write down things so daily.
    Does meaning just emerge from such behavior?</p>

<h2>Ways to Learn</h2>
<p>Things get easy if you want to read great books. As for me, I would like to get a perspective into the
    subject, after which further reading is done. The pattern suits for me because reading books may seem so
    difficult for me if I am not familiar with the subject.</p>

<h2>Books</h2>
<p>I went to a book store. But the most interesting book I found is <em>Introduction to random process with
    application</em> by Sheldon Ross, which also was priced at <b>179</b> rmb. I can't afford it.</p>
<p>And I also found that the typesetting of the book sucks.</p>

<h2>Sex and Power and Pegging</h2>
<p>The relationship of <em>sex</em> and <em>power</em> is so intriguing. Do you know pegging? I think pegging is
    the very thing that reflects the relationship of sex and power. One (a woman) is thirsty for this reversion
    of the power which, in some people's view is the just the rebel against power. However, this exact behavior
    reflects that everyone is so constrained by the power.</p>

<h2>E-books</h2>
<p>Reading e-books can be suffering. Devices are important. But I can't afford a good device.</p>
