<p class="p24">Once, during the doubtful consultations, he asked whither we were going; and upon being told that it was not certain whether to Mull or Col, he cried, &lsquo;Col for my money!&rsquo; I now went down, with Col and Mr. Simpson, to visit him. He was lying in philosophick tranquillity with a greyhound of Col&rsquo;s at his back, keeping him warm. Col is quite the <span class="t8">Juvenis qui gaudet canibus</span>. He had, when we left Talisker, two greyhounds, two terriers, a pointer, and a large Newfoundland water-dog. He lost one of his terriers by the road, but had still five dogs with him. I was very ill, and very desirous to get to shore. When I was told that we could not land that night, as the storm had now increased, I looked so miserably, as Col afterwards informed me, that what Shakspeare has made the Frenchman say of the English soldiers, when scantily dieted, <span class="t8">&lsquo;Piteous they will look, like drowned mice!&rsquo;</span> might, I believe, have been well applied to me. There was in the harbour, before us, a Campbelltown vessel, the Betty, Kenneth Morrison master, taking in kelp, and bound for Ireland. We sent our boat to beg beds for two gentlemen, and that the master would send his boat, which was larger than ours. He accordingly did so, and Col and I were accommodated in his vessel till the morning.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">MONDAY, OCTOBER 4.</span></p>
<p class="p21">About eight o&rsquo;clock we went in the boat to Mr. Simpson&rsquo;s vessel, and took in Dr. Johnson. He was quite well, though he had tasted nothing but a dish of tea since Saturday night. On our expressing some surprise at this, he said, that, &lsquo;when he lodged in the Temple, and had no regular system of life, he had fasted for two days at a time, during which he had gone about visiting, though not at the hours of dinner or supper; that he had drunk tea, but eaten no bread; that this was no intentional fasting, but happened just in the course of a literary life.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">There was a little miserable publick-house close upon the shore, to which we should have gone, had we landed last night: but this morning Col resolved to take us directly to the house of Captain Lauchlan M&rsquo;Lean, a descendant of his family, who had acquired a fortune in the East-Indies, and taken a farm in Col. We had about an English mile to go to it. Col and Joseph, and some others, ran to some little horses, called here <span class="t8">Shelties</span>, that were running wild on a heath, and catched one of them. We had a saddle with us, which was clapped upon it, and a straw halter was put on its head. Dr. Johnson was then mounted, and Joseph very slowly and gravely led the horse. I said to Dr. Johnson, &lsquo;I wish, Sir, <span class="t8">the Club</span> saw you in this attitude.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">It was a very heavy rain, and I was wet to the skin. Captain M&rsquo;Lean had but a poor temporary house, or rather hut; however, it was a very good haven to us. There was a blazing peat-fire, and Mrs. M&rsquo;Lean, daughter of the minister of the parish, got us tea. I felt still the motion of the sea. Dr. Johnson said, it was not in imagination, but a continuation of motion on the fluids, like that of the sea itself after the storm is over.</p>
<p class="p24">There were some books on the board which served as a chimney-piece. Dr. Johnson took up Burnet&rsquo;s <span class="t8">History of his own Times</span>. He said, &lsquo;The first part of it is one of the most entertaining books in the English language; it is quite dramatick: while he went about every where, saw every where, and heard every where. By the first part, I mean so far as it appears that Burnet himself was actually engaged in what he has told; and this may be easily distinguished.&rsquo; Captain M&rsquo;Lean censured Burnet, for his high praise of Lauderdale in a dedication, when he shews him in his history to have been so bad a man. JOHNSON. &lsquo;I do not myself think that a man should say in a dedication what he could not say in a history. However, allowance should be made; for there is a great difference. The known style of a dedication is flattery: it professes to flatter. There is the same difference between what a man says in a dedication, and what he says in a history, as between a lawyer&rsquo;s pleading a cause, and reporting it.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">The day passed away pleasantly enough. The wind became fair for Mull in the evening, and Mr. Simpson resolved to sail next morning: but having been thrown into the island of Col we were unwilling to leave it unexamined, especially as we considered that the Campbelltown vessel would sail for Mull in a day or two, and therefore we determined to stay.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">TUESDAY, OCTOBER 5.</span></p>
<p class="p21">I rose, and wrote my <span class="t8">Journal</span> till about nine; and then went to Dr. Johnson, who sat up in bed and talked and laughed. I said, it was curious to look back ten years, to the time when we first thought of visiting the Hebrides. How distant and improbable the scheme then appeared! Yet here we were actually among them. &lsquo;Sir, (said he,) people may come to do any thing almost, by talking of it. I really believe, I could talk myself into building a house upon island Isa, though I should probably never come back again to see it. I could easily persuade Reynolds to do it; and there would be no great sin in persuading him to do it. Sir, he would reason thus: &ldquo;What will it cost me to be there once in two or three summers? Why, perhaps, five hundred pounds; and what is that, in comparison of having a fine retreat, to which a man can go, or to which he can send a friend?&rdquo; He would never find out that he may have this within twenty miles of London. Then I would tell him, that he may marry one of the Miss M&rsquo;Leods, a lady of great family. Sir, it is surprising how people will go to a distance for what they may have at home. I knew a lady who came up from Lincolnshire to Knightsbridge with one of her daughters, and gave five guineas a week for a lodging and a warm bath; that is, mere warm water. <span class="t8">That</span>, you know, could not be had in <span class="t8">Lincolnshire</span>! She said, it was made either too hot or too cold there.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">After breakfast, Dr. Johnson and I, and Joseph, mounted horses, and Col and the Captain walked with us about a short mile across the island. We paid a visit to the Reverend Mr. Hector M&rsquo;Lean. His parish consists of the islands of Col and Tyr-yi. He was about seventy-seven years of age, a decent ecclesiastick, dressed in a full suit of black clothes, and a black wig. He appeared like a Dutch pastor, or one of the assembly of divines at Westminster. Dr. Johnson observed to me afterwards, &lsquo;that he was a fine old man, and was as well-dressed, and had as much dignity in his appearance as the dean of a cathedral.&rsquo; We were told, that he had a valuable library, though but poor accommodation for it, being obliged to keep his books in large chests. It was curious to see him and Dr. Johnson together. Neither of them heard very distinctly; so each of them talked in his own way, and at the same time. Mr. M&rsquo;Lean said, he had a confutation of Bayle, by Leibnitz. JOHNSON. &lsquo;A confutation of Bayle, Sir! What part of Bayle do you mean? The greatest part of his writings is not confutable: it is historical and critical.&rsquo; Mr. M&rsquo;Lean said, &lsquo;the irreligious part;&rsquo; and proceeded to talk of Leibnitz&rsquo;s controversy with Clarke, calling Leibnitz a great man. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, Leibnitz persisted in affirming that Newton called space <span class="t8">sensorium numinis</span>, notwithstanding he was corrected, and desired to observe that Newton&rsquo;s words were QUASI <span class="t8">sensorium numinis</span>. No, Sir; Leibnitz was as paltry a fellow as I know. Out of respect to Queen Caroline, who patronised him, Clarke treated him too well.&rsquo; During the time that Dr. Johnson was thus going on, the old minister was standing with his back to the fire, cresting up erect, pulling down the front of his periwig, and talking what a great man Leibnitz was. To give an idea of the scene, would require a page with two columns; but it ought rather to be represented by two good players. The old gentleman said, Clarke was very wicked, for going so much into the Arian system. &lsquo;I will not say he was wicked, said Dr. Johnson; he might be mistaken.&rsquo; M&rsquo;LEAN. &lsquo;He was wicked, to shut his eyes against the Scriptures; and worthy men in England have since confuted him to all intents and purposes.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;I know not <span class="t8">who</span> has confuted him to <span class="t8">all intents and purposes</span>.&rsquo; Here again there was a double talking, each continuing to maintain his own argument, without hearing exactly what the other said.</p>
<p class="p24">I regretted that Dr. Johnson did not practice the art of accommodating himself to different sorts of people. Had he been softer with this venerable old man, we might have had more conversation; but his forcible spirit, and impetuosity of manner, may be said to spare neither sex nor age. I have seen even Mrs. Thrale stunned; but I have often maintained, that it is better he should retain his own manner. Pliability of address I conceive to be inconsistent with that majestick power of mind which he possesses, and which produces such noble effects. A lofty oak will not bend like a supple willow.</p>
<p class="p24">He told me afterwards, he liked firmness in an old man, and was pleased to see Mr. M&rsquo;Lean so orthodox. &lsquo;At his age, it is too late for a man to be asking himself questions as to his belief.&rsquo; We rode to the northern part of the island, where we saw the ruins of a church or chapel. We then proceeded to a place called Grissipol, or the rough Pool.</p>
<p class="p24">At Grissipol we found a good farm house, belonging to the Laird of Col, and possessed by Mr. M&rsquo;Sweyn. On the beach here there is a singular variety of curious stones. I picked up one very like a small cucumber. By the by, Dr. Johnson told me, that Gay&rsquo;s line in <span class="t8">The Beggars Opera</span>, &lsquo;As men should serve a cucumber,&rsquo; &amp;c. has no waggish meaning, with reference to men flinging away cucumbers as too <span class="t8">cooling</span>, which some have thought; for it has been a common saying of physicians in England, that a cucumber should be well sliced, and dressed with pepper and vinegar, and then thrown out, as good for nothing. Mr. M&rsquo;Sweyn&rsquo;s predecessors had been in Sky from a very remote period, upon the estate belonging to M&rsquo;Leod; probably before M&rsquo;Leod had it The name is certainly Norwegian, from <span class="t8">Sueno</span>, King of Norway. The present Mr. M&rsquo;Sweyn left Sky upon the late M&rsquo;Leod&rsquo;s raising his rents. He then got this farm from Col.</p>
<p class="p24">He appeared to be near fourscore; but looked as fresh, and was as strong as a man of fifty. His son Hugh looked older; and, as Dr. Johnson observed, had more the manners of an old man than he. I had often heard of such instances, but never saw one before. Mrs. M&rsquo;Sweyn was a decent old gentlewoman. She was dressed in tartan, and could speak nothing but Erse. She said, she taught Sir James M&rsquo;Donald Erse, and would teach me soon. I could now sing a verse of the song <span class="t8">Hatyin foam&rsquo;eri</span>, made in honour of Allan, the famous Captain of Clanranald, who fell at Sherrif-muir; whose servant, who lay on the field watching his master&rsquo;s dead body, being asked next day who that was, answered, &lsquo;He was a man yesterday.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">We were entertained here with a primitive heartiness. Whiskey was served round in a shell, according to the ancient Highland custom. Dr. Johnson would not partake of it; but, being desirous to do honour to the modes &lsquo;of other times,&rsquo; drank some water out of the shell.</p>
<p class="p24">In the forenoon Dr. Johnson said, &lsquo;it would require great resignation to live in one of these islands.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know, Sir; I have felt myself at times in a state of almost mere physical existence, satisfied to eat, drink, and sleep, and walk about, and enjoy my own thoughts; and I can figure a continuation of this.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Ay, Sir; but if you were shut up here, your own thoughts would torment you. You would think of Edinburgh or London, and that you could not be there.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">We set out after dinner for <span class="t8">Breacacha</span>, the family seat of the Laird of Col, accompanied by the young laird, who had now got a horse, and by the younger Mr. M&rsquo;Sweyn, whose wife had gone thither before us, to prepare every thing for our reception, the laird and his family being absent at Aberdeen. It is called <span class="t8">Breacacha</span>, or the Spotted Field, because in summer it is enamelled with clover and daisies, as young Col told me. We passed by a place where there is a very large stone, I may call it a <span class="t8">rock</span>;&mdash; &lsquo;a vast weight for Ajax.&rsquo; The tradition is, that a giant threw such another stone at his mistress, up to the top of a hill, at a small distance; and that she in return, threw this mass down to him. It was all in sport. </p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Malo me petit lasciva puella.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">As we advanced, we came to a large extent of plain ground. I had not seen such a place for a long time. Col and I took a gallop upon it by way of race. It was very refreshing to me, after having been so long taking short steps in hilly countries. It was like stretching a man&rsquo;s legs after being cramped in a short bed. We also passed close by a large extent of sand-hills, near two miles square. Dr. Johnson said, &lsquo;he never had the image before. It was horrible, if barrenness and danger could be so.&rsquo; I heard him, after we were in the house of <span class="t8">Breacacha</span>, repeating to himself, as he walked about the room, </p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;And smother&rsquo;d in the dusty whirlwind, dies.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Probably he had been thinking of the whole of the simile in <span class="t8">Cato</span>, of which that is the concluding line; the sandy desart had struck him so strongly. The sand has of late been blown over a good deal of meadow, and the people of the island say, that their fathers remembered much of the space which is now covered with sand, to have been under tillage. Col&rsquo;s house is situated on a bay called <span class="t8">Breacacha</span> Bay. We found here a neat new-built gentleman&rsquo;s house, better than any we had been in since we were at Lord Errol&rsquo;s. Dr. Johnson relished it much at first, but soon remarked to me, that &lsquo;there was nothing becoming a Chief about it: it was a mere tradesman&rsquo;s box.&rsquo; He seemed quite at home, and no longer found any difficulty in using the Highland address; for as soon as we arrived, he said, with a spirited familiarity, &lsquo;Now, <span class="t8">Col</span>, if you could get us a dish of tea.&rsquo; Dr. Johnson and I had each an excellent bed-chamber. We had a dispute which of us had the best curtains. His were rather the best, being of linen; but I insisted that my bed had the best posts, which was undeniable. &lsquo;Well, (said he,) if you <span class="t8">have</span> the best <span class="t8">posts</span>, we will have you tied to them and whipped.&rsquo; I mention this slight circumstance, only to shew how ready he is, even in mere trifles, to get the better of his antagonist, by placing him in a ludicrous view. I have known him sometimes use the same art, when hard pressed in serious disputation. Goldsmith, I remember, to retaliate for many a severe defeat which he has suffered from him, applied to him a lively saying in one of Cibber&rsquo;s comedies, which puts this part of his character in a strong light.&mdash; &lsquo;There is no arguing with Johnson; for, <span class="t8">if his pistol misses fire, he knocks you down with the butt end of it</span>.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 6.</span></p>
<p class="p21">After a sufficiency of sleep, we assembled at breakfast. We were just as if in barracks. Every body was master. We went and viewed the old castle of Col, which is not far from the present house, near the shore, and founded on a rock. It has never been a large feudal residence, and has nothing about it that requires a particular description. Like other old inconvenient buildings of the same age, it exemplified Gray&rsquo;s picturesque lines, </p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Huge windows that exclude the light,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And passages that lead to nothing.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">It may however be worth mentioning, that on the second story we saw a vault, which was, and still is, the family prison. There was a woman put into it by the laird, for theft, within these ten years; and any offender would be confined there yet; for, from the necessity of the thing, as the island is remote from any power established by law, the laird must exercise his jurisdiction to a certain degree.</p>
<p class="p24">We were shewn, in a corner of this vault, a hole, into which Col said greater criminals used to be put. It was now filled up with rubbish of different kinds. He said, it was of a great depth, &lsquo;Ay, (said Dr. Johnson, smiling,) all such places, that <span class="t8">are filled up</span>, were of a great depth.&rsquo; He is very quick in shewing that he does not give credit to careless or exaggerated accounts of things. After seeing the castle, we looked at a small hut near it. It is called <span class="t8">Teigh Franchich, i.e.</span> the Frenchman&rsquo;s House. Col could not tell us the history of it. A poor man with a wife and children now lived in it. We went into it, and Dr. Johnson gave them some charity. There was but one bed for all the family, and the hut was very smoky. When he came out, he said to me, <span class="t8">&lsquo;Et hoc secundum sententiam philosophorum est esse beatus</span>.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;The philosophers, when they placed happiness in a cottage, supposed cleanliness and no smoke.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, they did not think about either.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">We walked a little in the laird&rsquo;s garden, in which endeavours have been used to rear some trees; but, as soon as they got above the surrounding wall, they died. Dr. Johnson recommended sowing the seeds of hardy trees, instead of planting.</p>
<p class="p24">Col and I rode out this morning, and viewed a part of the island. In the course of our ride, we saw a turnip-field, which he had hoed with his own hands. He first introduced this kind of husbandry into the Western islands. We also looked at an appearance of lead, which seemed very promising. It has been long known; for I found letters to the late laird, from Sir John Areskine and Sir Alexander Murray, respecting it.</p>
<p class="p24">After dinner came Mr. M&rsquo;Lean, of Corneck, brother to Isle of Muck, who is a cadet of the family of Col. He possesses the two ends of Col, which belong to the Duke of Argyll. Corneck had lately taken a lease of them at a very advanced rent, rather than let the Campbells get a footing in the island, one of whom had offered nearly as much as he. Dr. Johnson well observed, that, &lsquo;landlords err much when they calculate merely what their land <span class="t8">may</span> yield. The rent must be in a proportionate ratio of what the land may yield, and of the power of the tenant to make it yield. A tenant cannot make by his land, but according to the corn and cattle which he has. Suppose you should give him twice as much land as he has, it does him no good, unless he gets also more stock. It is clear then, that the Highland landlords, who let their substantial tenants leave them, are infatuated; for the poor small tenants cannot give them good rents, from the very nature of things. They have not the means of raising more from their farms.&rsquo; Corneck, Dr. Johnson said, was the most distinct man that he had met with in these isles: he did not shut his eyes, or put his fingers in his ears, which he seemed to think was a good deal the mode with most of the people whom we have seen of late.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">THURSDAY, OCTOBER 7.</span></p>
<p class="p21">Captain M&rsquo;Lean joined us this morning at breakfast. There came on a dreadful storm of wind and rain, which continued all day, and rather increased at night. The wind was directly against our getting to Mull. We were in a strange state of abstraction from the world: we could neither hear from our friends, nor write to them. Col had brought Daille <span class="t8">on the Fathers</span>, Lucas <span class="t8">on Happiness</span>, and More&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Dialogues</span>, from the Reverend Mr. M&rsquo;Lean&rsquo;s, and Burnet&rsquo;s <span class="t8">History of his own Times</span>, from Captain M&rsquo;Lean&rsquo;s; and he had of his own some books of farming, and Gregory&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Geometry</span>. Dr. Johnson read a good deal of Burnet, and of Gregory, and I observed he made some geometrical notes in the end of his pocket-book. I read a little of Young&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Six Weeks&rsquo; Tour through the Southern Counties</span>; and Ovid&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Epistles</span>, which I had bought at Inverness, and which helped to solace many a weary hour.</p>
<p class="p24">We were to have gone with Dr. Johnson this morning to see the mine; but were prevented by the storm. While it was raging, he said, &lsquo;We may be glad we are not <span class="t8">damnati ad metalla</span>.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">FRIDAY, OCTOBER 8.</span></p>
<p class="p21">Dr. Johnson appeared to-day very weary of our present confined situation. He said, &lsquo;I want to be on the main land, and go on with existence. This is a waste of life.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I shall here insert, without regard to chronology, some of his conversation at different times.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;There was a man some time ago, who was well received for two years, among the gentlemen of Northamptonshire, by calling himself my brother. At last he grew so impudent as by his influence to get tenants turned out of their farms. Allen the Printer, who is of that county, came to me, asking, with much appearance of doubtfulness, if I had a brother; and upon being assured I had none alive, he told me of the imposition, and immediately wrote to the country, and the fellow was dismissed. It pleased me to hear that so much was got by using my name. It is not every name that can carry double; do both for a man&rsquo;s self and his brother (laughing). I should be glad to see the fellow. However, I could have done nothing against him. A man can have no redress for his name being used, or ridiculous stories being told of him in the newspapers, except he can shew that he has suffered damage. Some years ago a foolish piece was published, said to be written <span class="t8">by S. Johnson</span>. Some of my friends wanted me to be very angry about this. I said, it would be in vain; for the answer would be, &ldquo;<span class="t8">S. Johnson</span> may be Simon Johnson, or Simeon Johnson, or Solomon Johnson;&rdquo; and even if the full name, Samuel Johnson, had been used, it might be said; &ldquo;it is not you; it is a much cleverer fellow.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Beauclerk and I, and Langton, and Lady Sydney Beauclerk, mother to our friend, were one day driving in a coach by Cuper&rsquo;s Gardens, which were then unoccupied. I, in sport, proposed that Beauclerk and Langton, and myself should take them; and we amused ourselves with scheming how we should all do our parts. Lady Sydney grew angry, and said, &ldquo;an old man should not put such things in young people&rsquo;s heads.&rdquo; She had no notion of a joke, Sir; had come late into life, and had a mighty unpliable understanding.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;<span class="t8">Carte&rsquo;s Life of the Duke of Ormond</span> is considered as a book of authority; but it is ill-written. The matter is diffused in too many words; there is no animation, no compression, no vigour. Two good volumes in duodecimo might be made out of the two in folio.</p>
<p class="p24">Talking of our confinement here, I observed, that our discontent and impatience could not be considered as very unreasonable; for that we were just in the state of which Seneca complains so grievously, while in exile in Corsica. &lsquo;Yes, (said Dr. Johnson,) and he was not farther from home than we are.&rsquo; The truth is, he was much nearer.</p>
<p class="p24">There was a good deal of rain to-day, and the wind was still contrary. Corneck attended me, while I amused myself in examining a collection of papers belonging to the family of Col. The first laird was a younger son of the Chieftain M&rsquo;Lean, and got the middle part of Col for his patrimony. Dr. Johnson having given a very particular account of the connection between this family and a branch of the family of Camerons, called M&rsquo;Lonich, I shall only insert the following document, (which I found in Col&rsquo;s cabinet,) as a proof of its continuance, even to a late period: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">TO THE LAIRD OF COL.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The long-standing tract of firm affectionate friendship &lsquo;twixt your worthy predecessors and ours affords us such assurance, as that we may have full relyance on your favour and undoubted friendship, in recommending the bearer, Ewen Cameron, our cousin, son to the deceast Dugall M&rsquo;Connill of Innermaillie, sometime in Glenpean, to your favour and conduct, who is a man of undoubted honesty and discretion, only that he has the misfortune of being alledged to have been accessory to the killing of one of M&rsquo;Martin&rsquo;s family about fourteen years ago, upon which alledgeance the M&rsquo;Martins are now so sanguine on revenging, that they are fully resolved for the deprivation of his life; to the preventing of which you are relyed on by us, as the only fit instrument, and a most capable person. Therefore your favour and protection is expected and intreated, during his good behaviour; and failing of which behaviour, you&rsquo;ll please to use him as a most insignificant person deserves.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Sir, he had, upon the alledgeance foresaid, been transported, at Lochiel&rsquo;s desire, to France, to gratify the M&rsquo;Martins, and upon his return home, about five years ago, married: But now he is so much threatened by the M&rsquo;Martins, that he is not secure enough to stay where he is, being Ardmurchan, which occasions this trouble to you. Wishing prosperity and happiness to attend still yourself, worthy Lady, and good family, we are, in the most affectionate manner,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Dear Sir, </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your most obliged, affectionate,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;And most humble Servants,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;DUGALL CAMERON, <span class="t8">of Strone</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DUGALL CAMERON, <span class="t8">of Barr</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DUGALL CAMERON, <span class="t8">of Inveriskvouilline</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DUGALL CAMERON, <span class="t8">of Invinvalie</span>.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Strone, 11th March, 1737.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Ewen Cameron was protected, and his son has now a farm from the Laird of Col, in Mull.</p>
<p class="p24">The family of Col was very loyal in the time of the great Montrose, from whom I found two letters in his own handwriting. The first is as follows: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">FOR MY VERY LOVING FRIEND THE LAIRD OF COALL.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I must heartily thank you for all your willingness and good affection to his Majesty&rsquo;s service, and particularly the sending alongs of your son, to who I will heave ane particular respect, hopeing also that you will still continue ane goode instrument for the advanceing ther of the King&rsquo;s service, for which, and all your former loyal carriages, be confident you shall find the effects of his Ma&rsquo;s favour, as they can be witnessed you by </p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Your very faithful friende,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;MONTROSE.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Strethearne, 20 Jan. 1646.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">The other is: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;FOR THE LAIRD OF COL.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Having occasion to write to your fields, I cannot be forgetful of your willingness and good affection to his Majesty&rsquo;s service. I acknowledge to you, and thank you heartily for it, assuring, that in what lies in my power, you shall find the good. Meanwhile, I shall expect that you will continue your loyal endeavours, in wishing those slack people that are about you, to appear more obedient than they do, and loyal in their prince&rsquo;s service; whereby I assure you, you shall find me ever </p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Your faithful friend,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;MONTROSE.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Petty, 17 April, 1646.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I found some uncouth lines on the death of the present laird&rsquo;s father, intituled &lsquo;Nature&rsquo;s Elegy upon the death of Donald Maclean of Col.&rsquo; They are not worth insertion. I shall only give what is called his Epitaph, which Dr. Johnson said, &lsquo;was not so very bad.&rsquo; </p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Nature&rsquo;s minion, Virtue&rsquo;s wonder,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Art&rsquo;s corrective here lyes under.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I asked, what &lsquo;Art&rsquo;s corrective&rsquo; meant. &lsquo;Why, Sir, (said he,) that the laird was so exquisite, that he set art right, when she was wrong.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I found several letters to the late Col, from my father&rsquo;s old companion at Paris, Sir Hector M&rsquo;Lean, one of which was written at the time of settling the colony in Georgia. It dissuades Col from letting people go there, and assures him there will soon be an opportunity of employing them better at home. Hence it appears that emigration from the Highlands, though not in such numbers at a time as of late, has always been practised. Dr. Johnson observed that &lsquo;the Lairds, instead of improving their country, diminished their people.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">There are several districts of sandy desart in Col. There are forty-eight lochs of fresh water; but many of them are very small, &mdash; meer pools. About one half of them, however, have trout and eel. There is a great number of horses in the island, mostly of a small size. Being over-stocked, they sell some in Tir-yi, and on the main land. Their black cattle, which are chiefly rough-haired, are reckoned remarkably good. The climate being very mild in winter, they never put their beasts in any house. The lakes are never frozen so as to bear a man; and snow never lies above a few hours. They have a good many sheep, which they eat mostly themselves, and sell but a few. They have goats in several places. There are no foxes; no serpents, toads, or frogs, nor any venomous creature. They have otters and mice here; but had no rats till lately that an American vessel brought them. There is a rabbit-warren on the north-east of the island, belonging to the Duke of Argyle. Young Col intends to get some hares, of which there are none at present. There are no black-cock, muir-fowl, nor partridges; but there are snipe, wild-duck, wild-geese, and swans, in winter; wild-pidgeons, plover, and great number of starlings; of which I shot some, and found them pretty good eating. Woodcocks come hither, though there is not a tree upon the island. There are no rivers in Col; but only some brooks, in which there is a great variety of fish. In the whole isle there are but three hills, and none of them considerable for a Highland country. The people are very industrious. Every man can tan. They get oak, and birch-bark, and lime, from the main land. Some have pits; but they commonly use tubs. I saw brogues very well tanned; and every man can make them. They all make candles of the tallow of their beasts, both moulded and dipped; and they all make oil of the livers of fish. The little fish called Cuddies produce a great deal. They sell some oil out of the island, and they use it much for light in their houses, in little iron lamps, most of which they have from England; but of late their own blacksmith makes them. He is a good workman; but he has no employment in shoeing horses, for they all go unshod here, except some of a better kind belonging to young Col, which were now in Mull. There are two carpenters in Col; but most of the inhabitants can do something as boat-carpenters. They can all dye. Heath is used for yellow; and for red, a moss which grows on stones. They make broad-cloth, and tartan, and linen, of their own wool and flax, sufficient for their own use; as also stockings. Their bonnets come from the mainland. Hard-ware and several small articles are brought annually from Greenock, and sold in the only shop in the island, which is kept near the house, or rather hut, used for publick worship, there being no church in the island. The inhabitants of Col have increased considerably within these thirty years, as appears from the parish registers. There are but three considerable tacksmen on Col&rsquo;s part of the island: the rest is let to small tenants, some of whom pay so low a rent as four, three, or even two guineas. The highest is seven pounds, paid by a farmer, whose son goes yearly on foot to Aberdeen for education, and in summer returns, and acts as a schoolmaster in Col. Dr. Johnson said, &lsquo;There is something noble in a young man&rsquo;s walking two hundred miles and back again, every year, for the sake of learning.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">This day a number of people came to Col, with complaints of each others&rsquo; trespasses. Corneck, to prevent their being troublesome, told them, that the lawyer from Edinburgh was here, and if they did not agree, he would take them to task. They were alarmed at this; said, they had never been used to go to law, and hoped Col would settle matters himself. In the evening Corneck left us.</p>
<p class="p24">As, in our present confinement, any thing that had even the name of curious was an object of attention, I proposed that Col should shew me the great stone, mentioned in a former page, as having been thrown by a giant to the top of a mountain. Dr. Johnson, who did not like to be left alone, said he would accompany us as far as riding was practicable. We ascended a part of the hill on horseback, and Col and I scrambled up the rest. A servant held our horses, and Dr. Johnson placed himself on the ground, with his back against a large fragment of rock. The wind being high, he let down the cocks of his hat, and tied it with his handkerchief under his chin. While we were employed in examining the stone, which did not repay our trouble in getting to it, he amused himself with reading <span class="t8">Gataker on Lots and on the Christian Watch,</span> a very learned book, of the last age, which had been found in the garret of Col&rsquo;s house, and which he said was a treasure here. When we descried him from above, he had a most eremitical appearance; and on our return told us, he had been so much engaged by Gataker, that he had never missed us. His avidity for variety of books, while we were in Col, was frequently expressed; and he often complained that so few were within his reach. Upon which I observed to him, that it was strange he should complain of want of books, when he could at any time make such good ones.</p>
<p class="p24">We next proceeded to the lead mine. In our way we came to a strand of some extent, where we were glad to take a gallop, in which my learned friend joined with great alacrity. Dr. Johnson, mounted on a large bay mare without shoes, and followed by a foal, which had some difficulty in keeping up with him, was a singular spectacle.</p>
<p class="p24">After examining the mine, we returned through a very uncouth district, full of sand hills; down which, though apparent precipices, our horses carried us with safety, the sand always gently sliding away from their feet. Vestiges of houses were pointed out to us, which Col, and two others who had joined us, asserted had been overwhelmed with sand blown over them. But, on going close to one of them, Dr. Johnson shewed the absurdity of the notion, by remarking, that &lsquo;it was evidently only a house abandoned, the stones of which had been taken away for other purposes; for the large stones, which form the lower part of the walls, were still standing higher than the sand. If <span class="t8">they</span> were not blown over, it was clear nothing higher than they could be blown over.&rsquo; This was quite convincing to me; but it made not the least impression on Col and the others, who were not to be argued out of a Highland tradition.</p>
<p class="p24">We did not sit down to dinner till between six and seven. We lived plentifully here, and had a true welcome. In such a season good firing was of no small importance. The peats were excellent, and burned cheerfully. Those at Dunvegan, which were damp, Dr. Johnson called &lsquo;a sullen fuel.&rsquo; Here a Scottish phrase was singularly applied to him. One of the company having remarked that he had gone out on a stormy evening, and brought in a supply of peats from the stack, old Mr. M&rsquo;Sweyn said, &lsquo;that was <span class="t8">main honest</span>!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Blenheim being occasionally mentioned, he told me he had never seen it: he had not gone formerly; and he would not go now, just as a common spectator, for his money: he would not put it in the power of some man about the Duke of Marlborough to say, &lsquo;Johnson was here; I knew him, but I took no notice of him.&rsquo; He said, he should be very glad to see it, if properly invited, which in all probability would never be the case, as it was not worth his while to seek for it. I observed, that he might be easily introduced there by a common friend of ours, nearly related to the duke. He answered, with an uncommon attention to delicacy of feeling, &lsquo;I doubt whether our friend be on such a footing with the duke as to carry any body there; and I would not give him the uneasiness of seeing that I knew he was not, or even of being himself reminded of it.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">SUNDAY, OCTOBER 10.</span></p>
<p class="p21">There was this day the most terrible storm of wind and rain that I ever remember. It made such an awful impression on us all, as to produce, for some time, a kind of dismal quietness in the house. The day was passed without much conversation: only, upon my observing that there must be something bad in a man&rsquo;s mind, who does not like to give leases to his tenants, but wishes to keep them in a perpetual wretched dependance on his will, Dr. Johnson said, &lsquo;You are right: it is a man&rsquo;s duty to extend comfort and security among as many people as he can. He should not wish to have his tenants mere <span class="t8">Ephemerae</span>, &mdash; mere beings of an hour.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;But, Sir, if they have leases is there not some danger that they may grow insolent? I remember you yourself once told me, an English tenant was so independent, that, if provoked, he would <span class="t8">throw</span> his rent at his landlord.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Depend upon it, Sir, it is the landlord&rsquo;s own fault, if it is thrown at him. A man may always keep his tenants in dependence enough, though they have leases. He must be a good tenant indeed, who will not fall behind in his rent, if his landlord will let him; and if he does fall behind, his landlord has him at his mercy. Indeed, the poor man is always much at the mercy of the rich; no matter whether landlord or tenant. If the tenant lets his landlord have a little rent beforehand, or has lent him money, then the landlord is in his power. There cannot be a greater man than a tenant who has lent money to his landlord; for he has under subjection the very man to whom he should be subjected.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">MONDAY, OCTOBER II.</span></p>
<p class="p21">We had some days ago engaged the Campbelltown vessel to carry us to Mull, from the harbour where she lay. The morning was fine, and the wind fair and moderate; so we hoped at length to get away.</p>
<p class="p24">Mrs. M&rsquo;Sweyn, who officiated as our landlady here, had never been on the main land. On hearing this, Dr. Johnson said to me, before her, &lsquo;That is rather being behind-hand with life. I would at least go and see Glenelg.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;You yourself, Sir, have never seen, till now, any thing but your native island.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;But, Sir, by seeing London, I have seen as much of life as the world can shew.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;You have not seen Pekin.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;What is Pekin? Ten thousand Londoners would <span class="t8">drive</span> all the people of Pekin: they would drive them like deer.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">We set out about eleven for the harbour; but, before we reached it, so violent a storm came on, that we were obliged again to take shelter in the house of Captain M&rsquo;Lean, where we dined, and passed the night.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">TUESDAY, OCTOBER 12.</span></p>
<p class="p21">After breakfast, we made a second attempt to get to the harbour; but another storm soon convinced us that it would be in vain. Captain M&rsquo;Lean&rsquo;s house being in some confusion, on account of Mrs. M&rsquo;Lean being expected to lie-in, we resolved to go to Mr. M&rsquo;Sweyn&rsquo;s, where we arrived very wet, fatigued, and hungry. In this situation, we were somewhat disconcerted by being told that we should have no dinner till late in the evening, but should have tea in the mean time. Dr. Johnson opposed this arrangement; but they persisted, and he took the tea very readily. He said to me afterwards, &lsquo;You must consider, Sir, a dinner here is a matter of great consequence. It is a thing to be first planned, and then executed. I suppose the mutton was brought some miles off, from some place where they knew there was a sheep killed.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Talking of the good people with whom we were, he said, &lsquo;Life has not got at all forward by a generation in M&rsquo;Sweyn&rsquo;s family; for the son is exactly formed upon the father. What the father says, the son says; and what the father looks, the son looks.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">There being little conversation to-night, I must endeavour to recollect what I may have omitted on former occasions. When I boasted, at Rasay, of my independency of spirit, and that I could not be bribed, he said, &lsquo;Yes, you may be bribed by flattery.&rsquo; At the Reverend Mr. M&rsquo;Lean&rsquo;s, Dr. Johnson asked him, if the people of Col had any superstitions. He said, &lsquo;No.&rsquo; The cutting peats at the increase of the moon was mentioned as one; but he would not allow it, saying, it was not a superstition, but a whim. Dr. Johnson would not admit the distinction. There were many superstitions, he maintained, not connected with religion; and this was one of them. On Monday we had a dispute at the Captain&rsquo;s, whether sand-hills could be fixed down by art. Dr. Johnson said, &lsquo;How <span class="t8">the devil</span> can you do it?&rsquo; but instantly corrected himself, &lsquo;How can you do it?&rsquo; I never before heard him use a phrase of that nature.</p>
<p class="p24">He has particularities which it is impossible to explain. He never wears a night-cap, as I have already mentioned; but he puts a handkerchief on his head in the night. The day that we left Talisker, he bade us ride on. He then turned the head of his horse back towards Talisker, stopped for some time; then wheeled round to the same direction with ours, and then came briskly after us. He sets open a window in the coldest day or night, and stands before it. It may do with his constitution; but most people, amongst whom I am one, would say, with the frogs in the fable, &lsquo;This may be sport to you; but it is death to us.&rsquo; It is in vain to try to find a meaning in every one of his particularities, which, I suppose, are mere habits, contracted by chance; of which every man has some that are more or less remarkable. His speaking to himself, or rather repeating, is a common habit with studious men accustomed to deep thinking; and, in consequence of their being thus rapt, they will even laugh by themselves, if the subject which they are musing on is a merry one. Dr. Johnson is often uttering pious ejaculations, when he appears to be talking to himself; for sometimes his voice grows stronger, and parts of the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer are heard. I have sat beside him with more than ordinary reverence on such occasions.</p>
<p class="p24">In our Tour, I observed that he was disgusted whenever he met with coarse manners. He said to me, &lsquo;I know not how it is, but I cannot bear low life: and I find others, who have as good a right as I to be fastidious, bear it better, by having mixed more with different sorts of men. You would think that I have mixed pretty well too.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He read this day a good deal of my <span class="t8">Journal</span>, written in a small book with which he had supplied me, and was pleased, for he said, &lsquo;I wish thy books were twice as big.&rsquo; He helped me to fill up blanks which I had left in first writing it, when I was not quite sure of what he had said, and he corrected any mistakes that I had made. &lsquo;They call me a scholar, (said he,) and yet how very little literature is there in my conversation.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;That, Sir, must be according to your company. You would not give literature to those who cannot taste it. Stay till we meet Lord Elibank.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">We had at last a good dinner, or rather supper, and were very well satisfied with our entertainment.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 13.</span></p>
<p class="p21">Col called me up, with intelligence that it was a good day for a passage to Mull; and just as we rose, a sailor from the vessel arrived for us. We got all ready with dispatch. Dr. Johnson was displeased at my bustling, and walking quickly up and down. He said, &lsquo;It does not hasten us a bit. It is getting on horseback in a ship. All boys do it; and you are longer a boy than others.&rsquo; He himself has no alertness, or whatever it may be called; so he may dislike it, as <span class="t8">Oderunt hilarem tristes.</span></p>
<p class="p24">Before we reached the harbour, the wind grew high again. However, the small boat was waiting and took us on board. We remained for some time in uncertainty what to do: at last it was determined, that, as a good part of the day was over, and it was dangerous to be at sea at night, in such a vessel, and such weather, we should not sail till the morning tide, when the wind would probably be more gentle. We resolved not to go ashore again, but lie here in readiness. Dr. Johnson and I had each a bed in the cabin. Col sat at the fire in the fore-castle, with the captain, and Joseph, and the rest. I eat some dry oatmeal, of which I found a barrel in the cabin. I had not done this since I was a boy. Dr. Johnson owned that he too was fond of it when a boy; a circumstance which I was highly pleased to hear from him, as it gave me an opportunity of observing that, notwithstanding his joke on the article of OATS, he was himself a proof that this kind of <span class="t8">food</span> was not peculiar to the people of Scotland.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">THURSDAY, OCTOBER 14.</span></p>
<p class="p21">When Dr. Johnson awaked this morning, he called <span class="t8">&lsquo;Lanky!&rsquo;</span> having, I suppose, been thinking of Langton; but corrected himself instantly, and cried, <span class="t8">&lsquo;Bozzy!&rsquo;</span> He has a way of contracting the names of his friends. Goldsmith feels himself so important now, as to be displeased at it. I remember one day, when Tom Davies was telling that Dr. Johnson said, We are all in labour for a name to <span class="t8">Goldy&rsquo;s</span> play,&rsquo; Goldsmith cried &lsquo;I have often desired him not to call me <span class="t8">Goldy.&rsquo;</span></p>
<p class="p24">Between six and seven we hauled our anchor, and set sail with a fair breeze; and, after a pleasant voyage, we got safely and agreeably into the harbour of Tobermorie, before the wind rose, which it always has done, for some days, about noon. Tobermorie is an excellent harbour. An island lies before it, and it is surrounded by a hilly theatre. The island is too low, otherwise this would be quite a secure port; but, the island not being a sufficient protection, some storms blow very hard here. Not long ago, fifteen vessels were blown from their moorings. There are sometimes sixty or seventy sail here: to-day there were twelve or fourteen vessels. To see such a fleet was the next thing to seeing a town. The vessels were from different places; Clyde, Campbelltown, Newcastle, &amp;c. One was returning to Lancaster from Hamburgh. After having been shut up so long in Col, the sight of such an assemblage of moving habitations, containing such a variety of people, engaged in different pursuits, gave me much gaiety of spirit. When we had landed, Dr. Johnson said, &lsquo;Boswell is now all alive. He is like Antaeus; he gets new vigour whenever he touches the ground.&rsquo; I went to the top of a hill fronting the harbour, from whence I had a good view of it. We had here a tolerable inn. Dr. Johnson had owned to me this morning, that he was out of humour. Indeed, he shewed it a good deal in the ship; for when I was expressing my joy on the prospect of our landing in Mull, he said, he had no joy, when he recollected that it would be five days before he should get to the main land. I was afraid he would now take a sudden resolution to give up seeing Icolmkill. A dish of tea, and some good bread and butter, did him service, and his bad humour went off. I told him, that I was diverted to hear all the people whom we had visited in our tour, say, <span class="t8">&lsquo;Honest man!</span> he&rsquo;s pleased with every thing; he&rsquo;s always content!&rsquo;&mdash; &lsquo;Little do they know,&rsquo; said I. He laughed, and said, &lsquo;You rogue!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">We sent to hire horses to carry us across the island of Mull to the shore opposite to Inchkenneth, the residence of Sir Allan M&rsquo;Lean, uncle to young Col, and Chief of the M&rsquo;Leans, to whose house we intended to go the next day. Our friend Col went to visit his aunt, the wife of Dr. Alexander M&rsquo;Lean, a physician, who lives about a mile from Tobermorie.</p>
<p class="p24">Dr. Johnson and I sat by ourselves at the inn, and talked a good deal. I told him, that I had found, in Leandro Alberti&rsquo;s Description of Italy, much of what Addison has given us in his <span class="t8">Remarks</span>. He said, &lsquo;The collection of passages from the Classicks has been made by another Italian: it is, however, impossible to detect a man as a plagiary in such a case, because all who set about making such a collection must find the same passages; but, if you find the same applications in another book, then Addison&rsquo;s learning in his <span class="t8">Remarks</span> tumbles down. It is a tedious book; and, if it were not attached to Addison&rsquo;s previous reputation, one would not think much of it. Had he written nothing else, his name would not have lived. Addison does not seem to have gone deep in Italian literature: he shews nothing of it in his subsequent writings. He shews a great deal of French learning. There is, perhaps, more knowledge circulated in the French language than in any other. There is more original knowledge in English.&rsquo; &lsquo;But the French (said I) have the art of accommodating literature.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Yes, Sir: we have no such book as Moreri&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Dictionary</span>.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Their <span class="t8">Ana</span> are good.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;A few of them are good; but we have one book of that kind better than any of them; Selden&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Table-talk</span>. As to original literature, the French have a couple of tragick poets who go round the world, Racine and Corneille, and one comick poet, Moliere.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;They have Fenelon.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, <span class="t8">Telemachus</span> is pretty well.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;And Voltaire, Sir.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;He has not stood his trial yet. And what makes Voltaire chiefly circulate is collection; such as his <span class="t8">Universal History</span>.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;What do you say to the Bishop of Meaux?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, nobody reads him.&rsquo; He would not allow Massilon and Bourdaloue to go round the world. In general, however, he gave the French much praise for their industry.</p>
<p class="p24">He asked me whether he had mentioned, in any of the papers of the <span class="t8">Rambler</span>, the description in Virgil of the entrance into Hell, with an application to the press; &lsquo;for (said he) I do not much remember them.&rsquo; I told him, &lsquo;No.&rsquo; Upon which he repeated it: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Vestibulum ante ipsum, primisque in faucibus orci,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luctus et ultrices posuere cubilia Curae;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pallentesque habitant Morbi, tristisque Senectus,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Et metus, et malesuada Fames, et turpis Egestas,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Terribiles visu formae; Lethumque, Laborque.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Now, (said he) almost all these apply exactly to an authour: all these are the concomitants of a printing-house. I proposed to him to dictate an essay on it, and offered to write it. He said, he would not do it then, but perhaps would write one at some future period.</p>
<p class="p24">The Sunday evening that we sat by ourselves at Aberdeen, I asked him several particulars of his life, from his early years, which he readily told me; and I wrote them down before him. This day I proceeded in my inquiries, also writing them in his presence. I have them on detached sheets. I shall collect authentick materials for THE LIFE OF SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.; and, if I survive him, I shall be one who will most faithfully do honour to his memory. I have now a vast treasure of his conversation, at different times, since the year 1762, when I first obtained his acquaintance; and, by assiduous inquiry, I can make up for not knowing him sooner.</p>
<p class="p24">A Newcastle ship-master, who happened to be in the house, intruded himself upon us. He was much in liquor, and talked nonsense about his being a man for <span class="t8">Wilkes and Liberty</span>, and against the ministry. Dr. Johnson was angry, that &lsquo;a fellow should come into <span class="t8">our</span> company, who was fit for <span class="t8">no</span> company.&rsquo; He left us soon.</p>
<p class="p24">Col returned from his aunt, and told us, she insisted that we should come to her house that night. He introduced to us Mr. Campbell, the Duke of Argyle&rsquo;s factor in Tyr-yi. He was a genteel, agreeable man. He was going to Inverary, and promised to put letters into the post-office for us. I now found that Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s desire to get on the main land, arose from his anxiety to have an opportunity of conveying letters to his friends.</p>
<p class="p24">After dinner, we proceeded to Dr. M&rsquo;Lean&rsquo;s, which was about a mile from our inn. He was not at home, but we were received by his lady and daughter, who entertained us so well, that Dr. Johnson seemed quite happy. When we had supped, he asked me to give him some paper to write letters. I begged he would write short ones, and not <span class="t8">expatiate</span>, as we ought to set off early. He was irritated by this, and said, &lsquo;What must be done; must be done: the thing is past a joke.&rsquo; &lsquo;Nay, Sir, (said I,) write as much as you please; but do not blame me, if we are kept six days before we get to the main land. You were very impatient in the morning: but no sooner do you find yourself in good quarters, than you forget that you are to move.&rsquo; I got him paper enough, and we parted in good humour.</p>
<p class="p24">Let me now recollect whatever particulars I have omitted. In the morning I said to him, before we landed at Tobermorie, &lsquo;We shall see Dr. M&rsquo;Lean, who has written <span class="t8">The History of the M&rsquo;Leans&rsquo;</span>. JOHNSON. &lsquo;I have no great patience to stay to hear the history of the M&rsquo;Leans. I would rather hear the History of the Thrales.&rsquo; When on Mull, I said, &lsquo;Well, Sir, this is the fourth of the Hebrides that we have been upon.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Nay, we cannot boast of the number we have seen. We thought we should see many more. We thought of sailing about easily from island to island; and so we should, had we come at a better season; but we, being wise men, thought it would be summer all the year where <span class="t8">we</span> were. However, Sir, we have seen enough to give us a pretty good notion of the system of insular life.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Let me not forget, that he sometimes amused himself with very slight reading; from which, however, his conversation shewed that he contrived to extract some benefit. At Captain M&rsquo;Lean&rsquo;s he read a good deal in <span class="t8">The Charmer</span>, a collection of songs.</p>
<p class="p24">We this morning found that we could not proceed, there being a violent storm of wind and rain, and the rivers being impassable. When I expressed my discontent at our confinement, Dr. Johnson said, &lsquo;Now that I have had an opportunity of writing to the main land, I am in no such haste.&rsquo; I was amused with his being so easily satisfied; for the truth was, that the gentleman who was to convey our letters, as I was now informed, was not to set out for Inverary for some time; so that it was probable we should be there as soon as he: however, I did not undeceive my friend, but suffered him to enjoy his fancy.</p>
<p class="p24">Dr. Johnson asked, in the evening, to see Dr. M&rsquo;Lean&rsquo;s books. He took down Willis <span class="t8">de Anima Brutorum</span>, and pored over it a good deal.</p>
<p class="p24">Miss M&rsquo;Lean produced some Erse poems by John M&rsquo;Lean, who was a famous bard in Mull, and had died only a few years ago. He could neither read nor write. She read and translated two of them; one, a kind of elegy on Sir John M&rsquo;Lean&rsquo;s being obliged to fly his country in 1715; another, a dialogue between two Roman Catholick young ladies, sisters, whether it was better to be a nun or to marry. I could not perceive much poetical imagery in the translation. Yet all of our company who understood Erse, seemed charmed with the original. There may, perhaps, be some choice of expression, and some excellence of arrangement, that cannot be shewn in translation.</p>
<p class="p24">After we had exhausted the Erse poems, of which Dr. Johnson said nothing, Miss M&rsquo;Lean gave us several tunes on a spinnet, which, though made so long ago as in 1667, was still very well toned. She sung along with it. Dr. Johnson seemed pleased with the musick, though he owns he neither likes it, nor has hardly any perception of it. At Mr. M&rsquo;Pherson&rsquo;s, in Slate, he told us, that &lsquo;he knew a drum from a trumpet, and a bagpipe from a guittar, which was about the extent of his knowledge of musick.&rsquo; To-night he said, that, &lsquo;if he had learnt musick, he should have been afraid he would have done nothing else but play. It was a method of employing the mind without the labour of thinking at all, and with some applause from a man&rsquo;s self.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">We had the musick of the bagpipe every day, at Armidale, Dunvegan, and Col. Dr. Johnson appeared fond of it, and used often to stand for some time with his ear close to the great drone.</p>
<p class="p24">The penurious gentleman of our acquaintance, formerly alluded to, afforded us a topick of conversation to-night. Dr. Johnson said, I ought to write down a collection of the instances of his narrowness, as they almost exceeded belief. Col told us, that O&rsquo;Kane, the famous Irish harper, was once at that gentleman&rsquo;s house. He could not find in his heart to give him any money, but gave him a key for a harp, which was finely ornamented with gold and silver, and with a precious stone, and was worth eighty or a hundred guineas. He did not know the value of it; and when he came to know it, he would fain have had it back; but O&rsquo;Kane took care that he should not. JOHNSON. &lsquo;They exaggerate the value; every body is so desirous that he should be fleeced. I am very willing it should be worth eighty or a hundred guineas; but I do not believe it.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;I do not think O&rsquo;Kane was obliged to give it back.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;No, Sir. If a man with his eyes open, and without any means used to deceive him, gives me a thing, I am not to let him have it again when he grows wiser. I like to see how avarice defeats itself: how, when avoiding to part with money, the miser gives something more valuable.&rsquo; Col said, the gentleman&rsquo;s relations were angry at his giving away the harp-key, for it had been long in the family. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, he values a new guinea more than an old friend.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Col also told us, that the same person having come up with a serjeant and twenty men, working on the high road, he entered into discourse with the serjeant, and then gave him sixpence for the men to drink. The serjeant asked, &lsquo;Who is this fellow?&rsquo;. Upon being informed, he said, &lsquo;If I had known who he was, I should have thrown it in his face.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;There is much want of sense in all this. He had no business to speak with the serjeant. He might have been in haste, and trotted on. He has not learnt to be a miser: I believe we must take him apprentice.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;He would grudge giving half a guinea to be taught.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Nay, Sir, you must teach him <span class="t8">gratis</span>. You must give him an opportunity to practice your precepts.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Let me now go back, and glean <span class="t8">Johnsoniana</span>. The Saturday before we sailed from Slate, I sat awhile in the afternoon, with Dr. Johnson in his room, in a quiet serious frame. I observed, that hardly any man was accurately prepared for dying; but almost every one left something undone, something in confusion; that my father, indeed, told me he knew one man, (Carlisle of Limekilns,) after whose death all his papers were found in exact order; and nothing was omitted in his will. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, I had an uncle who died so; but such attention requires great leisure, and great firmness of mind. If one was to think constantly of death, the business of life would stand still. I am no friend to making religion appear too hard. Many good people have done harm by giving severe notions of it. In the same way, as to learning: I never frighten young people with difficulties; on the contrary, I tell them that they may very easily get as much as will do very well. I do not indeed tell them that they will be <span class="t8">Bentleys</span>!</p>
<p class="p24">The night we rode to Col&rsquo;s house, I said, &lsquo;Lord Elibank is probably wondering what is become of us.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;No, no; he is not thinking of us.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;But recollect the warmth with which he wrote. Are we not to believe a man, when he says he has a great desire to see another? Don&rsquo;t you believe that I was very impatient for your coming to Scotland?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Yes, Sir; I believe you were; and I was impatient to come to you. A young man feels so, but seldom an old man.&rsquo; I however convinced him that Lord Elibank, who has much of the spirit of a young man, might feel so. He asked me if our jaunt had answered expectation. I said it had much exceeded it. I expected much difficulty with him, and had not found it. &lsquo;And (he added) wherever we have come, we have been received like princes in their progress.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He said, he would not wish not to be disgusted in the Highlands; for that would be to lose the power of distinguishing, and a man might then lie down in the middle of them. He wished only to conceal his disgust.</p>
<p class="p24">At Captain M&rsquo;Lean&rsquo;s, I mentioned Pope&rsquo;s friend, Spence. JOHNSON. &lsquo;He was a weak conceited man.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;A good scholar, Sir?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, no, Sir.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;He was a pretty scholar.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;You have about reached him.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Last night at the inn, when the factor in Tyr-yi spoke of his having heard that a roof was put on some part of the buildings at Icolmkill, I unluckily said, &lsquo;It will be fortunate if we find a cathedral with a roof on it.&rsquo; I said this from a foolish anxiety to engage Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s curiosity more. He took me short at once. &lsquo;What, Sir? how can you talk so? If we shall <span class="t8">find</span> a cathedral roofed! as if we were going to a <span class="t8">terra incognita</span>; when every thing that is at Icolmkill is so well known. You are like some New-England-men who came to the mouth of the Thames. &ldquo;Come, (say they,) let us go up and see what sort of inhabitants there are here.&rdquo; They talked, Sir, as if they had been to go up the Susquehannah, or any other American river.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">SATURDAY, OCTOBER 16.</span></p>
<p class="p21">This day there was a new moon, and the weather changed for the better. Dr. Johnson said of Miss M&rsquo;Lean, &lsquo;She is the most accomplished lady that I have found in the Highlands. She knows French, musick, and drawing, sews neatly, makes shellwork, and can milk cows; in short, she can do every thing. She talks sensibly, and is the first person whom I have found, that can translate Erse poetry literally.&rsquo; We set out, mounted on little Mull horses. Mull corresponded exactly with the idea which I had always had of it; a hilly country, diversified with heath and grass, and many rivulets. Dr. Johnson was not in very good humour. He said, it was a dreary country, much worse than Sky. I differed from him. &lsquo;O, Sir, (said he,) a most dolorous country!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">We had a very hard journey to-day. I had no bridle for my sheltie, but only a halter; and Joseph rode without a saddle. At one place, a loch having swelled over the road, we were obliged to plunge through pretty deep water. Dr. Johnson observed, how helpless a man would be, were he travelling here alone, and should meet with any accident; and said, &lsquo;he longed to get to <span class="t8">a country of saddles and bridles</span>&rsquo; He was more out of humour to-day, than he has been in the course of our Tour, being fretted to find that his little horse could scarcely support his weight; and having suffered a loss, which, though small in itself, was of some consequence to him, while travelling the rugged steeps of Mull, where he was at times obliged to walk. The loss that I allude to was that of the large oak-stick, which, as I formerly mentioned, he had brought with him from London. It was of great use to him in our wild peregrination; for, ever since his last illness in 1766, he has had a weakness in his knees, and has not been able to walk easily. It had too the properties of a measure; for one nail was driven into it at the length of a foot; another at that of a yard. In return for the services it had done him, he said, this morning he would make a present of it to some Museum; but he little thought he was so soon to lose it. As he preferred riding with a switch, it was entrusted to a fellow to be delivered to our baggage-man, who followed us at some distance; but we never saw it more. I could not persuade him out of a suspicion that it had been stolen. &lsquo;No, no, my friend, (said he,) it is not to be expected that any man in Mull, who has got it, will part with it. Consider, Sir, the value of such a <span class="t8">piece of timber</span> here!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">As we travelled this forenoon, we met Dr. McLean, who expressed much regret at his having been so unfortunate as to be absent while we were at his house.</p>
<p class="p24">We were in hopes to get to Sir Allan Maclean&rsquo;s at Inchkenneth, to-night; but the eight miles, of which our road was said to consist, were so very long, that we did not reach the opposite coast of Mull till seven at night, though we had set out about eleven in the forenoon; and when we did arrive there, we found the wind strong against us. Col determined that we should pass the night at M&rsquo;Quarrie&rsquo;s, in the island of Ulva, which lies between Mull and Inchkenneth; and a servant was sent forward to the ferry, to secure the boat for us; but the boat was gone to the Ulva side, and the wind was so high that the people could not hear him call; and the night so dark that they could not see a signal. We should have been in a very bad situation, had there not fortunately been lying in the little sound of Ulva an Irish vessel, the Bonnetta, of Londonderry, Captain M&rsquo;Lure, master. He himself was at M&rsquo;Quarrie&rsquo;s; but his men obligingly came with their long-boat, and ferried us over. M&rsquo;Quarrie&rsquo;s house was mean; but we were agreeably surprized with the appearance of the master, whom we found to be intelligent, polite, and much a man of the world. Though his clan is not numerous, he is a very ancient Chief, and has a burial place at Icolmkill. He told us, his family had possessed Ulva for nine hundred years; but I was distressed to hear that it was soon to be sold for payment of his debts.</p>
<p class="p24">Captain M&rsquo;Lure, whom we found here, was of Scotch extraction, and properly a McLeod, being descended of some of the M&rsquo;Leods who went with Sir Normand of Bernera to the battle of Worcester; and after the defeat of the royalists, fled to Ireland, and, to conceal themselves, took a different name. He told me, there was a great number of them about Londonderry; some of good property. I said, they should now resume their real name. The Laird of M&rsquo;Leod should go over, and assemble them, and make them all drink the large horn full, and from that time they should be M&rsquo;Leods. The captain informed us, he had named his ship the Bonnetta, out of gratitude to Providence; for once, when he was sailing to America with a good number of passengers, the ship in which he then sailed was becalmed for five weeks, and during all that time, numbers of the fish Bonnetta swam close to her, and were caught for food; he resolved therefore, that the ship he should next get, should be called the Bonnetta.</p>
<p class="p24">M&rsquo;Quarrie told us a strong instance of the second sight. He had gone to Edinburgh, and taken a man-servant along with him. An old woman, who was in the house, said one day, &lsquo;M&rsquo;Quarrie will be at home to-morrow, and will bring two gentlemen with him;&rsquo; and she said, she saw his servant return in red and green. He did come home next day. He had two gentlemen with him; and his servant had a new red and green livery, which M&rsquo;Quarrie had bought for him at Edinburgh, upon a sudden thought, not having the least intention when he left home to put his servant in livery; so that the old woman could not have heard any previous mention of it. This, he assured us, was a true story.</p>
<p class="p24">M&rsquo;Quarrie insisted that the <span class="t8">Mercheta Mulierum</span>, mentioned in our old charters, did really mean the privilege which a lord of the manor, or a baron, had, to have the first night of all his vassals&rsquo; wives. Dr. Johnson said, the belief of such a custom having existed was also held in England, where there is a tenure called <span class="t8">Borough English</span>, by which the eldest child does not inherit, from a doubt of his being the son of the tenant. M&rsquo;Quarrie told us, that still, on the marriage of each of his tenants, a sheep is due to him; for which the composition is fixed at five shillings. I suppose, Ulva is the only place where this custom remains.</p>
<p class="p24">Talking of the sale of an estate of an ancient family, which was said to have been purchased much under its value by the confidential lawyer of that family, and it being mentioned that the sale would probably be set aside by a suit in equity, Dr. Johnson said, &lsquo;I am very willing that this sale should be set aside, but I doubt much whether the suit will be successful; for the argument for avoiding the sale is founded on vague and indeterminate principles, as that the price was too low, and that there was a great degree of confidence placed by the seller in the person who became the purchaser. Now, how low should a price be? or what degree of confidence should there be to make a bargain be set aside? a bargain, which is a wager of skill between man and man. If, indeed, any fraud can be proved, that will do.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">When Dr. Johnson and I were by ourselves at night, I observed of our host, &lsquo;<span class="t8">aspectum generosum habet;&rsquo;&mdash; &lsquo;et generosum animum</span>&rsquo;, he added. For fear of being overheard in the small Highland houses, I often talked to him in such Latin as I could speak, and with as much of the English accent as I could assume, so as not to be understood, in case our conversation should be too loud for the space.</p>
<p class="p24">We had each an elegant bed in the same room; and here it was that a circumstance occurred, as to which he has been strangely misunderstood. From his description of his chamber, it has erroneously been supposed, that his bed being too short for him, his feet during the night were in the mire; whereas he has only said, that when he undressed, he felt his feet in the mire: that is, the clay-floor of the room, on which he stood upon before he went into bed, was wet, in consequence of the windows being broken, which let in the rain.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">SUNDAY, OCTOBER 17.</span></p>
<p class="p21">Being informed that there was nothing worthy of observation in Ulva, we took boat, and proceeded to Inchkenneth, where we were introduced by our friend Col to Sir Allan M&rsquo;Lean, the Chief of his clan, and to two young ladies, his daughters. Inchkenneth is a pretty little island, a mile long, and about half a mile broad, all good land.</p>
<p class="p24">As we walked up from the shore, Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s heart was cheered by the sight of a road marked with cart-wheels, as on the main land; a thing which we had not seen for a long time. It gave us a pleasure similar to that which a traveller feels, when, whilst wandering on what he fears is a desert island, he perceives the print of human feet. Military men acquire excellent habits of having all conveniences about them. Sir Allan M&rsquo;Lean, who had been long in the army, and had now a lease of the island, had formed a commodious habitation, though it consisted but of a few small buildings, only one story high. He had, in his little apartments, more things than I could enumerate in a page or two.</p>
<p class="p24">Among other agreeable circumstances, it was not the least, to find here a parcel of the <span class="t8">Caledonian Mercury</span>, published since we left Edinburgh; which I read with that pleasure which every man feels who has been for some time secluded from the animated scenes of the busy world.</p>
<p class="p24">Dr. Johnson found books here. He bade me buy Bishop Gastrell&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Christian Institutes</span>, which was lying in the room. He said, &lsquo;I do not like to read any thing on a Sunday, but what is theological; not that I would scrupulously refuse to look at any thing which a friend should shew me in a newspaper; but in general, I would read only what is theological. I read just now some of Drummond&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Travels</span>, before I perceived what books were here. I then took up Derham&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Physico-Theology</span>.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Every particular concerning this island having been so well described by Dr. Johnson, it would be superfluous in me to present the publick with the observations that I made upon it, in my <span class="t8">Journal</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">I was quite easy with Sir Allan almost instantaneously. He knew the great intimacy that had been between my father and his predecessor, Sir Hector, and was himself of a very frank disposition. After dinner, Sir Allan said he had got Dr. Campbell about an hundred subscribers to his <span class="t8">Britannia Elucidata</span>, (a work since published under the title of <span class="t8">A Political Survey of Great Britain</span>,) of whom he believed twenty were dead, the publication having been so long delayed. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, I imagine the delay of publication is owing to this; &mdash; that, after publication, there will be no more subscribers, and few will send the additional guinea to get their books: in which they will be wrong; for there will be a great deal of instruction in the work. I think highly of Campbell. In the first place, he has very good parts. In the second place, he has very extensive reading; not, perhaps, what is properly called learning, but history, politicks, and, in short, that popular knowledge which makes a man very useful. In the third place, he has learned much by what is called the <span class="t8">vox viva</span>. He talks with a great many people.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Speaking of this gentleman, at Rasay, he told us, that he one day called on him, and they talked of Tull&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Husbandry</span>. Dr. Campbell said something. Dr. Johnson began to dispute it. &lsquo;Come, (said Dr. Campbell,) we do not want to get the better of one another: we want to encrease each other&rsquo;s ideas.&rsquo; Dr. Johnson took it in good part, and the conversation then went on coolly and instructively. His candour in relating this anecdote does him much credit, and his conduct on that occasion proves how easily he could be persuaded to talk from a better motive than &lsquo;for victory.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Dr. Johnson here shewed so much of the spirit of a Highlander, that he won Sir Allan&rsquo;s heart: indeed, he has shewn it during the whole of our Tour. One night, in Col, he strutted about the room with a broad sword and target, and made a formidable appearance; and, another night, I took the liberty to put a large blue bonnet on his head. His age, his size, and his bushy grey wig, with this covering on it, presented the image of a venerable <span class="t8">Senachi</span>: and, however unfavourable to the Lowland Scots, he seemed much pleased to assume the appearance of an ancient Caledonian. We only regretted that he could not be prevailed with to partake of the social glass. One of his arguments against drinking, appears to me not convincing. He urged, that &lsquo;in proportion as drinking makes a man different from what he is before he has drunk, it is bad; because it has so far affected his reason.&rsquo; But may it not be answered, that a man may be altered by it <span class="t8">for the better</span>; that his spirits may be exhilarated, without his reason being affected. On the general subject of drinking, however, I do not mean positively to take the other side. I am <span class="t8">dubius, non improbus</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">In the evening, Sir Allan informed us that it was the custom of his house to have prayers every Sunday; and Miss M&rsquo;Lean read the evening service, in which we all joined. I then read Ogden&rsquo;s second and ninth <span class="t8">Sermons on Prayer</span>, which, with their other distinguished excellence, have the merit of being short. Dr. Johnson said, that it was the most agreeable Sunday he had ever passed; and it made such an impression on his mind, that he afterwards wrote the following Latin verses upon Inchkenneth: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;INSULA SANCTI KENNETHI.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parva quidem regio, sed relligione priorum</p>

<p class="p24">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">MONDAY, OCTOBER 18.</span></p>
<p class="p21">We agreed to pass this day with Sir Allan, and he engaged to have every thing in order for our voyage to-morrow.</p>
<p class="p24">Being now soon to be separated from our amiable friend young Col, his merits were all remembered. At Ulva he had appeared in a new character, having given us a good prescription for a cold. On my mentioning him with warmth, Dr. Johnson said, &lsquo;Col does every thing for us: we will erect a statue to Col.&rsquo; &lsquo;Yes, said I, and we will have him with his various attributes and characters, like Mercury, or any other of the heathen gods. We will have him as a pilot; we will have him as a fisherman, as a hunter, as a husbandman, as a physician.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I this morning took a spade, and dug a little grave in the floor of a ruined chapel, near Sir Allan M&rsquo;Lean&rsquo;s house, in which I buried some human bones I found there. Dr. Johnson praised me for what I had done, though he owned, he could not have done it. He shewed in the chapel at Rasay his horrour at dead men&rsquo;s bones. He shewed it again at Col&rsquo;s house. In the Charter-room there was a remarkable large shin-bone, which was said to have been a bone of <span class="t8">John Garve</span>, one of the lairds. Dr. Johnson would not look at it; but started away.</p>
<p class="p24">At breakfast, I asked, &lsquo;What is the reason that we are angry at a trader&rsquo;s having opulence?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, the reason is, (though I don&rsquo;t undertake to prove that there is a reason,) we see no qualities in trade that should entitle a man to superiority. We are not angry at a soldier&rsquo;s getting riches, because we see that he possesses qualities which we have not. If a man returns from a battle, having lost one hand, and with the other full of gold, we feel that he deserves the gold; but we cannot think that a fellow, by sitting all day at a desk, is entitled to get above us.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;But, Sir, may we not suppose a merchant to be a man of an enlarged mind, such as Addison in the <span class="t8">Spectator</span> describes Sir Andrew Freeport to have been?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, we may suppose any fictitious character. We may suppose a philosophical day-labourer, who is happy in reflecting that, by his labour, he contributes to the fertility of the earth, and to the support of his fellow-creatures; but we find no such philosophical day-labourer. A merchant may, perhaps, be a man of an enlarged mind; but there is nothing in trade connected with an enlarged mind.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I mentioned that I had heard Dr. Solander say he was a Swedish Laplander. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, I don&rsquo;t believe he is a Laplander. The Laplanders are not much above four feet high. He is as tall as you; and he has not the copper colour of a Laplander.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;But what motive could he have to make himself a Laplander?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, he must either mean the word Laplander in a very extensive sense, or may mean a voluntary degradation of himself. &ldquo;For all my being the great man that you see me now, I was originally a Barbarian;&rdquo; as if Burke should say, &ldquo;I came over a wild Irishman.&rdquo; Which he might say in his present state of exaltation.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Having expressed a desire to have an island like Inchkenneth, Dr. Johnson set himself to think what would be necessary for a man in such a situation. &lsquo;Sir, I should build me a fortification, if I came to live here; for, if you have it not, what should hinder a parcel of ruffians to land in the night, and carry off every thing you have in the house, which, in a remote country, would be more valuable than cows and sheep? add to all this the danger of having your throat cut.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;I would have a large dog.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;So you may, Sir; but a large dog is of no use but to alarm.&rsquo; He, however, I apprehend, thinks too lightly of the power of that animal. I have heard him say, that he is afraid of no dog. &lsquo;He would take him up by the hinder legs, which would render him quite helpless, &mdash; and then knock his head against a stone, and beat out his brains.&rsquo; Topham Beauclerk told me, that at his house in the country, two large ferocious dogs were fighting. Dr. Johnson looked steadily at them for a little while; and then, as one would separate two little boys, who were foolishly hurting each other, he ran up to them, and cuffed their heads till he drove them asunder. But few men have his intrepidity, Herculean strength, or presence of mind. Most thieves or robbers would be afraid to encounter a mastiff.</p>
<p class="p24">I observed, that, when young Col talked of the lands belonging to his family, he always said, &lsquo;<span class="t8">my</span> lands.&rsquo; For this he had a plausible pretence; for he told me, there has been a custom in this family, that the laird resigns the estate to the eldest son when he comes of age, reserving to himself only a certain life-rent. He said, it was a voluntary custom; but I think I found an instance in the charter-room, that there was such an obligation in a contract of marriage. If the custom was voluntary, it was only curious; but if founded on obligation, it might be dangerous; for I have been told, that in Otaheité, whenever a child is born, (a son, I think,) the father loses his right to the estate and honours, and that this unnatural, or rather absurd custom, occasions the murder of many children.</p>
<p class="p24">Young Col told us he could run down a greyhound; &lsquo;for, (said he,) the dog runs himself out of breath, by going too quick, and then I get up with him.&rsquo; I accounted for his advantage over the dog, by remarking that Col had the faculty of reason, and knew how to moderate his pace, which the dog had not sense enough to do. Dr. Johnson said, &lsquo;He is a noble animal. He is as complete an islander as the mind can figure. He is a farmer, a sailor, a hunter, a fisher: he will run you down a dog: if any man has a <span class="t8">tail</span>, it is Col. He is hospitable; and he has an intrepidity of talk, whether he understands the subject or not. I regret that he is not more intellectual.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Dr. Johnson observed, that there was nothing of which he would not undertake to persuade a Frenchman in a foreign country. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll carry a Frenchman to St. Paul&rsquo;s Church-yard, and I&rsquo;ll tell him, &ldquo;by our law you may walk half round the church; but, if you walk round the whole, you will be punished capitally,&rdquo; and he will believe me at once. Now, no Englishman would readily swallow such a thing: he would go and inquire of somebody else.&rsquo; The Frenchman&rsquo;s credulity, I observed, must be owing to his being accustomed to implicit submission; whereas every Englishman reasons upon the laws of his country, and instructs his representatives, who compose the legislature. This day was passed in looking at a small island adjoining Inchkenneth, which afforded nothing worthy of observation; and in such social and gay entertainments as our little society could furnish.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">TUESDAY, OCTOBER 19.</span></p>
<p class="p21">After breakfast we took leave of the young ladies, and of our excellent companion Col, to whom we had been so much obliged. He had now put us under the care of his Chief; and was to hasten back to Sky. We parted from him with very strong feelings of kindness and gratitude; and we hoped to have had some future opportunity of proving to him the sincerity of what we felt; but in the following year he was unfortunately lost in the Sound between Ulva and Mull; and this imperfect memorial, joined to the high honour of being tenderly and respectfully mentioned by Dr. Johnson, is the only return which the uncertainty of human events has permitted us to make to this deserving young man.</p>
<p class="p24">Sir Allan, who obligingly undertook to accompany us to Icolmkill, had a strong good boat, with four stout rowers. We coasted along Mull till we reached <span class="t8">Gribon</span>, where is what is called Mackinnon&rsquo;s cave, compared with which that at Ulinish is inconsiderable. It is in a rock of a great height, close to the sea. Upon the left of its entrance there is a cascade, almost perpendicular from the top to the bottom of the rock. There is a tradition that it was conducted thither artificially, to supply the inhabitants of the cave with water. Dr. Johnson gave no credit to this tradition. As, on the one hand, his faith in the Christian religion is firmly founded upon good grounds; so, on the other, he is incredulous when there is no sufficient reason for belief; being in this respect just the reverse of modern infidels, who, however nice and scrupulous in weighing the evidences of religion, are yet often so ready to believe the most absurd and improbable tales of another nature, that Lord Hailes well observed, a good essay might be written <span class="t8">Sur la crédulité des Incrédules</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">The height of this cave I cannot tell with any tolerable exactness; but it seemed to be very lofty, and to be a pretty regular arch. We penetrated, by candlelight, a great way; by our measurement, no less than four hundred and eighty-five feet. Tradition says, that a piper and twelve men once advanced into this cave, nobody can tell how far; and never returned. At the distance to which we proceeded the air was quite pure; for the candle burned freely, without the least appearance of the flame growing globular; but as we had only one, we thought it dangerous to venture farther, lest, should it have been extinguished, we should have had no means of ascertaining whether we could remain without danger. Dr. Johnson said, this was the greatest natural curiosity he had ever seen.</p>
<p class="p24">We saw the island of Staffa, at no very great distance, but could not land upon it, the surge was so high on its rocky coast.</p>
<p class="p24">Sir Allan, anxious for the honour of Mull, was still talking of its <span class="t8">woods</span>, and pointing them out to Dr. Johnson, as appearing at a distance on the skirts of that island, as we sailed along. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, I saw at Tobermorie what they called a wood, which I unluckily took for <span class="t8">heath</span>. If you shew me what I shall take for <span class="t8">furze</span>, it will be something.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">In the afternoon we went ashore on the coast of Mull, and partook of a cold repast, which we carried with us. We hoped to have procured some rum or brandy for our boatmen and servants, from a publick-house near where we landed; but unfortunately a funeral a few days before had exhausted all their store. Mr. Campbell, however, one of the Duke of Argyle&rsquo;s tacksmen, who lived in the neighbourhood, on receiving a message from Sir Allan, sent us a liberal supply.</p>
<p class="p24">We continued to coast along Mull, and passed by Nuns&rsquo; Island, which, it is said, belonged to the nuns of Icolmkill, and from which, we were told, the stone for the buildings there was taken. As we sailed along by moon-light, in a sea somewhat rough, and often between black and gloomy rocks, Dr. Johnson said, &lsquo;If this be not <span class="t8">roving among the Hebrides</span>, nothing is. The repetition of words which he had so often previously used, made a strong impression on my imagination; and, by a natural course of thinking, led me to consider how our present adventures would appear to me at a future period.</p>
<p class="p24">I have often experienced, that scenes through which a man has passed, improve by lying in the memory: they grow mellow. <span class="t8">Acti labores sunt jucundi</span>. This may be owing to comparing them with present listless ease. Even harsh scenes acquire a softness by length of time; and some are like very loud sounds, which do not please, or at least do not please so much, till you are removed to a certain distance. They may be compared to strong coarse pictures, which will not bear to be viewed near. Even pleasing scenes improve by time, and seem more exquisite in recollection, than when they were present; if they have not faded to dimness in the memory. Perhaps, there is so much evil in every human enjoyment, when present, &mdash; so much dross mixed with it, that it requires to be refined by time; and yet I do not see why time should not melt away the good and the evil in equal proportions; &mdash; why the shade should decay, and the light remain in preservation.</p>
<p class="p24">After a tedious sail, which, by our following various turnings of the coast of Mull, was extended to about forty miles, it gave us no small pleasure to perceive a light in the village at Icolmkill, in which almost all the inhabitants of the island live, close to where the ancient building stood. As we approached the shore, the tower of the cathedral, just discernible in the air, was a picturesque object.</p>
<p class="p24">When we had landed upon the sacred place, which, as long as I can remember, I had thought on with veneration, Dr. Johnson and I cordially embraced. We had long talked of visiting Icolmkill; and, from the lateness of the season, were at times very doubtful whether we should be able to effect our purpose. To have seen it, even alone, would have given me great satisfaction; but the venerable scene was rendered much more pleasing by the company of my great and pious friend, who was no less affected by it than I was; and who has described the impressions it should make on the mind, with such strength of thought, and energy of language, that I shall quote his words, as conveying my own sensations much more forcibly than I am capable of doing: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;We were now treading that illustrious Island, which was once the luminary of the Caledonian regions, whence savage clans and roving barbarians derived the benefits of knowledge, and the blessings of religion. To abstract the mind from all local emotion would be impossible, if it were endeavoured, and would be foolish if it were possible. Whatever withdraws us from the power of our senses, whatever makes the past, the distant, or the future, predominate over the present, advances us in the dignity of thinking beings. Far from me, and from my friends, be such frigid philosophy as may conduct us indifferent and unmoved over any ground which has been dignified by wisdom, bravery, or virtue. That man is little to be envied, whose patriotism would not gain force upon the plain of <span class="t8">Marathon</span>, or whose piety would not grow warmer among the ruins of <span class="t8">Iona</span>!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Upon hearing that Sir Allan M&rsquo;Lean was arrived, the inhabitants, who still consider themselves as the people of M&rsquo;Lean, to whom the island formerly belonged, though the Duke of Argyle has at present possession of it, ran eagerly to him.</p>
<p class="p24">We were accommodated this night in a large barn, the island, affording no lodging that we should have liked so well. Some good hay was strewed at one end of it, to form a bed for us, upon which we lay with our clothes on; and we were furnished with blankets from the village. Each of us had a portmanteau for a pillow. When I awaked in the morning, and looked round me, I could not help smiling at the idea of the chief of the M&rsquo;Leans, the great English Moralist, and myself, lying thus extended in such a situation.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 20.</span></p>
<p class="p21">Early in the morning we surveyed the remains of antiquity at this place, accompanied by an illiterate fellow, as <span class="t8">Cicerone</span>, who called himself a descendant of a cousin of Saint Columba, the founder of the religious establishment here. As I knew that many persons had already examined them, and as I saw Dr. Johnson inspecting and measuring several of the ruins of which he has since given so full an account, my mind was quiescent; and I resolved to stroll among them at my ease, to take no trouble to investigate minutely, and only receive the general impression of solemn antiquity, and the particular ideas of such objects as should of themselves strike my attention.</p>
<p class="p24">We walked from the monastery of Nuns to the great church or cathedral, as they call it, along an old broken causeway. They told us, that this had been a street; and that there were good houses built on each side. Dr. Johnson doubted if it was any thing more than a paved road for the nuns. The convent of Monks, the great church, Oran&rsquo;s chapel, and four other chapels, are still to be discerned. But I must own that Icolmkill did not answer my expectations; for they were high, from what I had read of it, and still more from what I had heard and thought of it, from my earliest years. Dr. Johnson said, it came up to his expectations, because he had taken his impression from an account of it subjoined to Sacheverel&rsquo;s <span class="t8">History of the Isle of Man</span>, where it is said, there is not much to be seen here. We were both disappointed, when we were shewn what are called the monuments of the kings of Scotland, Ireland, and Denmark, and of a King of France. There are only some grave-stones flat on the earth, and we could see no inscriptions. How far short was this of marble monuments, like those in Westminster Abbey, which I had imagined here! The grave-stones of Sir Allan M&rsquo;Lean&rsquo;s family, and of that of M&rsquo;Quarrie, had as good an appearance as the royal grave-stones; if they were royal, we doubted.</p>
<p class="p24">My easiness to give credit to what I heard in the course of our Tour was too great. Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s peculiar accuracy of investigation detected much traditional fiction, and many gross mistakes. It is not to be wondered at, that he was provoked by people carelessly telling him, with the utmost readiness and confidence, what he found, on questioning them a little more, was erroneous. Of this there were innumerable instances.</p>
<p class="p24">I left him and Sir Allan at breakfast in our barn, and stole back again to the cathedral, to indulge in solitude and devout meditation. While contemplating the venerable ruins, I refleeted with much satisfaction, that the solemn scenes of piety never lose their sanctity and influence, though the cares and follies of life may prevent us from visiting them, or may even make us fancy that their effects are only &lsquo;as yesterday, when it is past,&rsquo; and never again to be perceived. I hoped, that, ever after having been in this holy place, I should maintain an exemplary conduct. One has a strange propensity to fix upon some point of time from whence a better course of life may begin.</p>
<p class="p24">Being desirous to visit the opposite shore of the island, where Saint Columba is said to have landed, I procured a horse from one M&rsquo;Ginnis, who ran along as my guide. The M&rsquo;Ginnises are said to be a branch of the clan of M&rsquo;Lean. Sir Allan had been told that this man had refused to send him some rum, at which the knight was in great indignation. &lsquo;You rascal! (said he,) don&rsquo;t you know that I can hang you, if I please?&rsquo; Not adverting to the Chieftain&rsquo;s power over his clan, I imagined that Sir Allan had known of some capital crime that the fellow had committed, which he could discover, and so get him condemned; and said, &lsquo;How so?&rsquo; &lsquo;Why, (said Sir Allan,) are they not all my people?&rsquo; Sensible of my inadvertency, and most willing to contribute what I could towards the continuation of feudal authority, &lsquo;Very true,&rsquo; said I. Sir Allan went on: &lsquo;Refuse to send rum to me, you rascal! Don&rsquo;t you know that, if I order you to go and cut a man&rsquo;s throat, you are to do it?&rsquo; &lsquo;Yes, an&rsquo;t please your honour! and my own too, and hang myself too.&rsquo; The poor fellow denied that he had refused to send the rum. His making these professions was not merely a pretence in presence of his Chief; for after he and I were out of Sir Allan&rsquo;s hearing, he told me, &lsquo;Had he sent his dog for the rum, I would have given it: I would cut my bones for him.&rsquo; It was very remarkable to find such an attachment to a Chief, though he had then no connection with the island, and had not been there for fourteen years. Sir Allan, by way of upbraiding the fellow, said, &lsquo;I believe you are a <span class="t8">Campbell</span>.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">The place which I went to see is about two miles from the village. They call it <span class="t8">Portawherry</span>, from the wherry in which Columba came; though, when they shew the length of his vessel, as marked on the beach by two heaps of stones, they say, &lsquo;Here is the length of the <span class="t8">Currach</span>&rsquo;, using the Erse word.</p>
<p class="p24">Icolmkill is a fertile island. The inhabitants export some cattle and grain; and I was told, they import nothing but iron and salt. They are industrious, and make their own woollen and linen cloth; and they brew a good deal of beer, which we did not find in any of the other islands.</p>
<p class="p24">We set sail again about mid-day, and in the evening landed on Mull, near the house of the Reverend Mr. Neal M&rsquo;Leod, who having been informed of our coming, by a message from Sir Allan, came out to meet us. We were this night very agreeably entertained at his house. Dr. Johnson observed to me, that he was the cleanest-headed man that he had met with in the Western islands. He seemed to be well acquainted with Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s writings, and courteously said, &lsquo;I have been often obliged to you, though I never had the pleasure of seeing you before.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He told us, he had lived for some time in St. Kilda, under the tuition of the minister or catechist there, and had there first read Horace and Virgil. The scenes which they describe must have been a strong contrast to the dreary waste around him.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">THURSDAY, OCTOBER 21.</span></p>
<p class="p21">This morning the subject of politicks was introduced. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Pulteney was as paltry a fellow as could be. He was a Whig, who pretended to be honest; and you know it is ridiculous for a Whig to pretend to be honest. He cannot hold it out.&rsquo; He called Mr. Pitt a meteor; Sir Robert Walpole a fixed star. He said, &lsquo;It is wonderful to think that all the force of government was required to prevent Wilkes from being chosen the chief magistrate of London, though the liverymen knew he would rob their shops, &mdash; knew he would debauch their daughters.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">BOSWELL. &lsquo;The History of England is so strange, that, if it were not so well vouched as it is, it would hardly be credible.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, if it were told as shortly, and with as little preparation for introducing the different events, as the History of the Jewish Kings, it would be equally liable to objections of improbability.&rsquo; Mr. M&rsquo;Leod was much pleased with the justice and novelty of the thought. Dr. Johnson illustrated what he had said, as follows: &lsquo;Take, as an instance, Charles the First&rsquo;s concessions to his parliament, which were greater and greater, in proportion as the parliament grew more insolent, and less deserving of trust. Had these concessions been related nakedly, without any detail of the circumstances which generally led to them, they would not have been believed.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Sir Allan M&rsquo;Lean bragged, that Scotland had the advantage of England, by its having more water. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, we would not have your water, to take the vile bogs which produce it. You have too much! A man who is drowned has more water than either of us;&rsquo; &mdash; and then he laughed. (But this was surely robust sophistry: for the people of taste in England, who have seen Scotland, own that its variety of rivers and lakes makes it naturally more beautiful than England, in that respect.) Pursuing his victory over Sir Allan, he proceeded: &lsquo;Your country consists of two things, stone and water. There is, indeed, a little earth above the stone in some places, but a very little; and the stone is always appearing. It is like a man in rags; the naked skin is still peeping out.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He took leave of Mr. M&rsquo;Leod, saying, &lsquo;Sir, I thank you for your entertainment, and your conversation.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Mr. Campbell, who had been so polite yesterday, came this morning on purpose to breakfast with us, and very obligingly furnished us with horses to proceed on our journey to Mr. M&rsquo;Lean&rsquo;s of <span class="t8">Lochbuy</span>, where we were to pass the night. We dined at the house of Dr. Alexander M&rsquo;Lean, another physician in Mull, who was so much struck with the uncommon conversation of Dr. Johnson, that he observed to me, &lsquo;This man is just a <span class="t8">hogshead</span> of sense.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Dr. Johnson said of the <span class="t8">Turkish Spy</span>, which lay in the room, that it told nothing but what every body might have known at that time; and that what was good in it, did not pay you for the trouble of reading to find it.</p>
<p class="p24">After a very tedious ride, through what appeared to me the most gloomy and desolate country I had ever beheld, we arrived, between seven and eight o&rsquo;clock, at May, the seat of the Laird of <span class="t8">Lochbuy</span>. <span class="t8">Buy</span>, in Erse, signifies yellow, and I at first imagined that the loch or branch of the sea here, was thus denominated, in the same manner as the <span class="t8">Red Sea</span>; but I afterwards learned that it derived its name from a hill above it, which being of a yellowish hue has the epithet of <span class="t8">Buy</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">We had heard much of Lochbuy&rsquo;s being a great roaring braggadocio, a kind of Sir John Falstaff, both in size and manners; but we found that they had swelled him up to a fictitious size, and clothed him with imaginary qualities. Col&rsquo;s idea of him was equally extravagant, though very different: he told us he was quite a Don Quixote; and said, he would give a great deal to sec him and Dr. Johnson together. The truth is, that Lochbuy proved to be only a bluff, comely, noisy old gentleman, proud of his hereditary consequence, and a very hearty and hospitable landlord. Lady Lochbuy was sister to Sir Allan M&rsquo;Lean, but much older. He said to me, &lsquo;They are quite <span class="t8">Antediluvians</span>.&rsquo; Being told that Dr. Johnson did not hear well, Lochbuy bawled out to him, &lsquo;Are you of the Johnstons of Glencro, or of Ardnamurchan?&rsquo; Dr. Johnson gave him a significant look, but made no answer; and I told Lochbuy that he was not Johns<span class="t8">ton</span>, but John<span class="t8">son</span>, and that he was an Englishman. Lochbuy some years ago tried to prove himself a weak man, liable to imposition, or, as we term it in Scotland, a <span class="t8">facile</span> man, in order to set aside a lease which he had granted; but failed in the attempt. On my mentioning this circumstance to Dr. Johnson, he seemed much surprized that such a suit was admitted by the Scottish law, and observed, that &lsquo;In England no man is allowed to <span class="t8">stultify</span> himself.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Sir Allan, Lochbuy, and I, had the conversation chiefly to ourselves to-night: Dr. Johnson, being extremely weary, went to bed soon after supper.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">FRIDAY, OCTOBER 22.</span></p>
<p class="p21">Before Dr. Johnson came to breakfast, Lady Lochbuy said, &lsquo;he was a <span class="t8">dungeon</span> of wit;&rsquo; a very common phrase in Scotland to express a profoundness of intellect, though he afterwards told me, that he never had heard it. She proposed that he should have some cold sheep&rsquo;s-head for breakfast. Sir Allan seemed displeased at his sister&rsquo;s vulgarity, and wondered how such a thought should come into her head. From a mischievous love of sport, I took the lady&rsquo;s part; and very gravely said, &lsquo;I think it is but fair to give him an offer of it. If he does not choose it, he may let it alone.&rsquo; &lsquo;I think so,&rsquo; said the lady, looking at her brother with an air of victory. Sir Allan, finding the matter desperate, strutted about the room, and took snuff. When Dr. Johnson came in, she called to him, &lsquo;Do you choose any cold sheep&rsquo;s-head, Sir?&rsquo; &lsquo;No, MADAM,&rsquo; said he, with a tone of surprise and anger. &lsquo;It is here, Sir,&rsquo; said she, supposing he had refused it to save the trouble of bringing it in. They thus went on at cross purposes, till he confirmed his refusal in a manner not to be misunderstood; while I sat quietly by, and enjoyed my success.</p>
<p class="p24">After breakfast, we surveyed the old castle, in the pit or dungeon of which Lochbuy had some years before taken upon him to imprison several persons; and though he had been fined in a considerable sum by the Court of Justiciary, he was so little affected by it, that while we were examining the dungeon, he said to me, with a smile, &lsquo;Your father knows something of this;&rsquo; (alluding to my father&rsquo;s having sat as one of the judges on his trial.) Sir Allan whispered me, that the laird could not be persuaded that he had lost his heritable jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="p24">We then set out for the ferry, by which we were to cross to the main land of Argyleshire. Lochbuy and Sir Allan accompanied us. We were told much of a war-saddle, on which this reputed Don Quixote used to be mounted; but we did not see it, for the young laird had applied it to a less noble purpose, having taken it to Falkirk fair <span class="t8">with a drove of black cattle.</span> We bade adieu to Lochbuy, and to our very kind conductor, Sir Allan M&rsquo;Lean, on the shore of Mull, and then got into the ferry-boat, the bottom of which was strewed with branches of trees or bushes, upon which we sat. We had a good day and a fine passage, and in the evening landed at Oban, where we found a tolerable inn. After having been so long confined at different times in islands, from which it was always uncertain when we could get away, it was comfortable to be now on the mainland, and to know that, if in health, we might get to any place in Scotland or England in a certain number of days.</p>
<p class="p24">Here we discovered from the conjectures which were formed, that the people on the main land were entirely ignorant of our motions; for in a Glasgow newspaper we found a paragraph, which, as it contains a just and well-turned compliment to my illustrious friend, I shall here insert: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;We are well assured that Dr. Johnson is confined by tempestuous weather to the isle of Sky; it being unsafe to venture, in a small boat, upon such a stormy surge as is very common there at this time of the year. Such a philosopher, detained on an almost barren island, resembles a whale left upon the strand. The latter will be welcome to every body, on account of his oil, his bone, &amp;c., and the other will charm his companions, and the rude inhabitants, with his superior knowledge and wisdom, calm resignation, and unbounded benevolence.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">SATURDAY, OCTOBER 23.</span></p>
<p class="p21">After a good night&rsquo;s rest, we breakfasted at our leisure. We talked of Goldsmith&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Traveller</span>, of which Dr. Johnson spoke highly; and, while I was helping him on with his great coat, he repeated from it the character of the British nation, which he did with such energy, that the tear started into his eye: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Stern o&rsquo;er each bosom reason holds her state,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With daring aims irregularly great,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pride in their port, defiance in their eye,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see the lords of human kind pass by,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Intent on high designs, a thoughtful band,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By forms unfashion&rsquo;d, fresh from nature&rsquo;s hand;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fierce in their native hardiness of soul,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;True to imagin&rsquo;d right, above control,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While ev&rsquo;n the peasant boasts these rights to scan,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And learns to venerate himself as man.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">We could get but one bridle here, which, according to the maxim <span class="t8">detur digniori</span>, was appropriated to Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s sheltie. I and Joseph rode with halters. We crossed in a ferry-boat a pretty wide lake, and on the farther side of it, close by the shore, found a hut for our inn. We were much wet. I changed my clothes in part, and was at pains to get myself well dried. Dr. Johnson resolutely kept on all his clothes, wet as they were, letting them steam before the smoky turf fire. I thought him in the wrong; but his firmness was, perhaps, a species of heroism.</p>
<p class="p24">I remember but little of our conversation. I mentioned Shenstone&rsquo;s saying of Pope, that he had the art of condensing sense more than any body. Dr. Johnson said, &lsquo;It is not true, Sir. There is more sense in a line of Cowley than in a page (or a sentence, or ten lines, &mdash; I am not quite certain of the very phrase) of Pope.&rsquo; He maintained that Archibald, Duke of Argyle, was a narrow man. I wondered at this; and observed, that his building so great a house at Inverary was not like a narrow man. &lsquo;Sir, (said he,) when a narrow man has resolved to build a house, he builds it like another man. But Archibald, Duke of Argyle, was narrow in his ordinary expences, in his quotidian expences.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">The distinction is very just. It is in the ordinary expences of life that a man&rsquo;s liberality or narrowness is to be discovered. I never heard the word <span class="t8">quotidian</span> in this sense, and I imagined it to be a word of Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s own fabrication; but I have since found it in <span class="t8">Young&rsquo;s Night Thoughts</span>, (Night fifth,) </p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Death&rsquo;s a destroyer of quotidian prey,&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">and in my friend&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Dictionary</span>, supported by the authorities of Charles I. and Dr. Donne.</p>
<p class="p24">It rained very hard as we journied on after dinner. The roar of torrents from the mountains, as we passed along in the dusk, and the other circumstances attending our ride in the evening, have been mentioned with so much animation by Dr. Johnson, that I shall not attempt to say any thing on the subject.</p>
<p class="p24">We got at night to Inverary, where we found an excellent inn. Even here, Dr. Johnson would not change his wet clothes.</p>
<p class="p24">The prospect of good accommodation cheered us much. We supped well; and after supper, Dr. Johnson, whom I had not seen taste any fermented liquor during all our travels, called for a gill of whiskey. &lsquo;Come, (said he,) let me know what it is that makes a Scotchman happy!&rsquo; He drank it all but a drop, which I begged leave to pour into my glass, that I might say we had drunk whisky together. I proposed Mrs. Thrale should be our toast. He would not have <span class="t8">her</span> drunk in whisky, but rather &lsquo;some insular lady;&rsquo; so we drank one of the ladies whom we had lately left. He owned to-night, that he got as good a room and bed as at an English inn.</p>
<p class="p24">I had here the pleasure of finding a letter from home, which relieved me from the anxiety I had suffered, in consequence of not having received any account of my family for many weeks. I also found a letter from Mr. Garrick, which was a regale as agreeable as a pine-apple would be in a desert. He had favoured me with his correspondence for many years; and when Dr. Johnson and I were at Inverness, I had written to him as follows: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inverness,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sunday, 29 August, 1773.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MY DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Here I am, and Mr. Samuel Johnson actually with me. We were a night at Fores, in coming to which, in the dusk of the evening, we passed over the bleak and blasted heath where Macbeth met the witches. Your old preceptor repeated, with much solemnity, the speech &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;How far is&rsquo;t called to Fores?&nbsp; What are these,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So wither&rsquo;d and so wild in their attire,&rdquo; &amp;c.</p>
<p class="p24">This day we visited the ruins of Macbeth&rsquo;s castle at Inverness. I have had great romantick satisfaction in seeing Johnson upon the classical scenes of Shakspeare in Scotland; which I really looked upon as almost as improbable as that &ldquo;Birnam wood should come to Dunsinane.&rdquo; Indeed, as I have always been accustomed to view him as a permanent London object, it would not be much more wonderful to me to see St. Paul&rsquo;s Church moving along where we now are. As yet we have travelled in post-chaises; but to-morrow we are to mount on horseback, and ascend into the mountains by Fort Augustus, and so on to the ferry, where we are to cross to Sky. We shall see that island fully, and then visit some more of the Hebrides; after which we are to land in Argyleshire, proceed by Glasgow to Auchinleck, repose there a competent time, and then return to Edinburgh, from whence the Rambler will depart for old England again, as soon as he finds it convenient. Hitherto we have had a very prosperous expedition. I flatter myself, <span class="t8">servetur ad imum, qualis ab incepto processerit</span>. He is in excellent spirits, and I have a rich journal of his conversation. Look back, Davy, to Litchfield, &mdash; run up through the time that has elapsed since you first knew Mr. Johnson, &mdash; and enjoy with me his present extraordinary Tour. I could not resist the impulse of writing to you from this place. The situation of the old castle corresponds exactly to Shakspeare&rsquo;s description. While we were there to-day, it happened oddly, that a raven perched upon one of the chimney-tops, and croaked. Then I in my turn repeated &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;The raven himself is hoarse,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That croaks the fatal entrance of Duncan,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under my battlements.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I wish you had been with us. Think what enthusiastick happiness I shall have to see Mr. Samuel Johnson walking among the romantick rocks and woods of my ancestors at Auchinleck! Write to me at Edinburgh. You owe me his verses on great George and tuneful Cibber, and the bad verses which led him to make his fine ones on Philips the musician. Keep your promise, and let me have them. I offer my very best compliments to Mrs. Garrick, and ever am, </p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Your warm admirer and friend,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;JAMES BOSWELL.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;<span class="t8">To David Garrick, Esq., London.</span>&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">His answer was as follows: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Hampton, September 14, 1773.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;You stole away from London, and left us all in the lurch; for we expected you one night at the club, and knew nothing of your departure. Had I payed you what I owed you, for the book you bought for me, I should only have grieved for the loss of your company, and slept with a quiet conscience; but, wounded as it is, it must remain so till I see you again, though I am sure our good friend Mr. Johnson will discharge the debt for me, if you will let him. Your account of your journey to <span class="t8">Fores</span>, the <span class="t8">raven</span>, <span class="t8">old castle</span>, &amp;c., &amp;c., made me half mad. Are you not rather too late in the year for fine weather, which is the life and soul of seeing places? I hope your pleasure will continue <span class="t8">qualis ab incepto</span>, &amp;c.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your friend &mdash;&mdash;&nbsp; &mdash; threatens me much. I only wish that he would put his threats in execution, and, if he prints his play, I will forgive him. I remember he complained to you, that his bookseller called for the money for some copies of his &mdash;&mdash;&nbsp; &mdash; , which I subscribed for, and that I desired him to call again. The truth is, that my wife was not at home, and that for weeks together I have not ten shillings in my pocket. &mdash; However, had it been otherwise, it was not so great a crime to draw his poetical vengeance upon me. I despise all that he can do, and am glad that I can so easily get rid of him and his ingratitude. I am hardened both to abuse and ingratitude.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;You, I am sure, will no more recommend your poetasters to my civility and good offices.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Shall I recommend to you a play of Eschylus, (the Prometheus,) published and translated by poor old Morell, who is a good scholar, and an acquaintance of mine? It will be but half a guinea, and your name shall be put in the list I am making for him. You will be in very good company.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Now for the Epitaphs!</p>
<p class="p24">[<span class="t8">These, together with the verses on George the Second, and Colley Cibber, as his Poet Laureat, of which imperfect copies are gone about, will appear in my Life of Dr. Johnson.</span>]</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I have no more paper, or I should have said more to you. My love and respects to Mr. Johnson.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Yours ever,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;D. GARRICK.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I can&rsquo;t write. I have the gout in my hand.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;<span class="t8">To James Boswell, Esq., Edinburgh.</span>&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">SUNDAY, OCTOBER 24.</span></p>
<p class="p21">We passed the forenoon calmly and placidly. I prevailed on Dr. Johnson to read aloud Ogden&rsquo;s sixth sermon on Prayer, which he did with a distinct expression, and pleasing solemnity. He praised my favourite preacher, his elegant language, and remarkable acuteness; and said, he fought infidels with their own weapons.</p>
<p class="p24">As a specimen of Ogden&rsquo;s manner, I insert the following passage from the sermon which Dr. Johnson now read. The preacher, after arguing against that vain philosophy which maintains, in conformity with the hard principle of eternal necessity, or unchangeable predetermination, that the only effect of prayer for others, although we are exhorted to pray for them, is to produce good dispositions in ourselves towards them; thus expresses himself: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;A plain man may be apt to ask, But if this then, though enjoined in the holy scriptures, is to be my real aim and intention, when I am taught to pray for other persons, why is it that I do not plainly so express it? Why is not the form of the petition brought nearer to the meaning? Give them, say I to our heavenly father, what is good. But this, I am to understand, will be as it will be, and is not for me to alter. What is it then that I am doing? I am desiring to become charitable myself; and why may I not plainly say so? Is there shame in it, or impiety? The wish is laudable: why should I form designs to hide it?</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Or is it, perhaps, better to be brought about by indirect means, and in this artful manner? Alas! who is it that I would impose on? From whom can it be, in this commerce, that I desire to hide any thing? When, as my Saviour commands me, I have <span class="t8">entered into my closet, and shut my door</span>, there are but two parties privy to my devotions, GOD and my own heart; which of the two am I deceiving?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He wished to have more books, and, upon inquiring if there were any in the house, was told that a waiter had some, which were brought to him; but I recollect none of them, except Hervey&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Meditations</span>. He thought slightingly of this admired book. He treated it with ridicule, and would not allow even the scene of the dying Husband and Father to be pathetick. I am not an impartial judge; for Hervey&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Meditations</span> engaged my affections in my early years. He read a passage concerning the moon, ludicrously, and shewed how easily he could, in the same style, make reflections on that planet, the very reverse of Hervey&rsquo;s, representing her as treacherous to mankind. He did this with much humour; but I have not preserved the particulars. He then indulged a playful fancy, in making a <span class="t8">Meditation on a Pudding</span>, of which I hastily wrote down, in his presence, the following note; which, though imperfect, may serve to give my readers some idea of it.</p>
<p class="p24">MEDITATION ON A PUDDING.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Let us seriously reflect of what a pudding is composed. It is composed of flour that once waved in the golden grain, and drank the dews of the morning; of milk pressed from the swelling udder by the gentle hand of the beauteous milk-maid, whose beauty and innocence might have recommended a worse draught; who, while she stroked the udder, indulged no ambitious thoughts of wandering in palaces, formed no plans for the destruction of her fellow-creatures: milk, which is drawn from the cow, that useful animal, that eats the grass of the field, and supplies us with that which made the greatest part of the food of mankind in the age which the poets have agreed to call golden. It is made with an egg, that miracle of nature, which the theoretical Burnet has compared to creation. An egg contains water within its beautiful smooth surface; and an unformed mass, by the incubation of the parent, becomes a regular animal, furnished with bones and sinews, and covered with feathers. Let us consider; can there be more wanting to complete the Meditation on a Pudding? If more is wanting, more may be found. It contains salt, which keeps the sea from putrefaction: salt, which is made the image of intellectual excellence, contributes to the formation of a pudding.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">In a Magazine I found a saying of Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s, something to this purpose; that the happiest part of a man&rsquo;s life is what he passes lying awake in bed in the morning. I read it to him. He said, &lsquo;I may, perhaps, have said this; for nobody, at times, talks more laxly than I do.&rsquo; I ventured to suggest to him, that this was dangerous from one of his authority.</p>
<p class="p24">I spoke of living in the country, and upon what footing one should be with neighbours. I observed that some people were afraid of being on too easy a footing with them, from an apprehension that their time would not be their own. He made the obvious remark, that it depended much on what kind of neighbours one has, whether it was desirable to be on an easy footing with them, or not. I mentioned a certain baronet, who told me, he never was happy in the country, till he was not on speaking terms with his neighbours, which he contrived in different ways to bring about. &lsquo;Lord &mdash;&mdash;&nbsp; &mdash;&mdash;&nbsp; &mdash; (said he) stuck long; but at last the fellow pounded my pigs, and then I got rid of him.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Nay, Sir, My Lord got rid of Sir John, and shewed how little he valued him, by putting his pigs in the pound.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I told Dr. Johnson I was in some difficulty how to act at Inverary. I had reason to think that the Duchess of Argyle disliked me, on account of my zeal in the Douglas cause; but the Duke of Argyle had always been pleased to treat me with great civility. They were now at the castle, which is a very short walk from our inn; and the question was, whether I should go and pay my respects there. Dr. Johnson, to whom I had stated the case, was clear that I ought; but, in his usual way, he was very shy of discovering a desire to be invited there himself. Though from a conviction of the benefit of subordination to society, he has always shewn great respect to persons of high rank, when he happened to be in their company, yet his pride of character has ever made him guard against any appearance of courting the great. Besides, he was impatient to go to Glasgow, where he expected letters. At the same time he was, I believe, secretly not unwilling to have attention paid him by so great a Chieftain, and so exalted a nobleman. He insisted that I should not go to the castle this day before dinner, as it would look like seeking an invitation. &lsquo;But, (said I,) if the Duke invites us to dine with him to-morrow, shall we accept?&rsquo; &lsquo;Yes, Sir;&rsquo; I think he said, &lsquo;to be sure.&rsquo; But, he added, &lsquo;He won&rsquo;t ask us!&rsquo; I mentioned, that I was afraid my company might be disagreeable to the duchess. He treated this objection with a manly disdain: &lsquo;<span class="t8">That</span>, Sir, he must settle with his wife.&rsquo; We dined well. I went to the castle just about the time when I supposed the ladies would be retired from dinner. I sent in my name; and, being shewn in, found the amiable Duke sitting at the head of his table with several gentlemen. I was most politely received, and gave his grace some particulars of the curious journey which I had been making with Dr. Johnson. When we rose from table, the Duke said to me, &lsquo;I hope you and Dr. Johnson will dine with us to-morrow.&rsquo; I thanked his grace; but told him, my friend was in a great hurry to get back to London. The Duke, with a kind complacency, said, &lsquo;He will stay one day; and I will take care he shall see this place to advantage.&rsquo; I said, I should be sure to let him know his grace&rsquo;s invitation. As I was going away, the Duke said, &lsquo;Mr. Boswell, won&rsquo;t you have some tea ?&rsquo; I thought it best to get over the meeting with the duchess this night; so respectfully agreed. I was conducted to the drawing room by the Duke, who announced my name; but the duchess, who was sitting with her daughter, Lady Betty Hamilton, and some other ladies, took not the least notice of me. I should have been mortified at being thus coldly received by a lady of whom I, with the rest of the world, have always entertained a very high admiration, had I not been consoled by the obliging attention of the Duke.</p>
<p class="p24">When I returned to the inn, I informed Dr. Johnson of the Duke of Argyle&rsquo;s invitation, with which he was much pleased, and readily accepted of it. We talked of a violent contest which was then carrying on, with a view to the next general election for Ayrshire; where one of the candidates, in order to undermine the old and established interest, had artfully held himself out as a champion for the independency of the county against aristocratick influence, and had persuaded several gentlemen into a resolution to oppose every candidate who was supported by peers. &lsquo;Foolish fellows! (said Dr. Johnson), don&rsquo;t they see that they are as much dependent upon the Peers one way as the other. The Peers have but to <span class="t8">oppose</span> a candidate to ensure him success. It is said the only way to make a pig go forward, is to pull him back by the tail. These people must be treated like pigs.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">MONDAY, OCTOBER 25.</span></p>
<p class="p21">My acquaintance, the Reverend Mr. John M&rsquo;Aulay, one of the Ministers of Inverary, and brother to our good friend at Calder, came to us this morning, and accompanied us to the castle, where I presented Dr. Johnson to the Duke of Argyle. We were shewn through the house; and I never shall forget the impression made upon my fancy by some of the ladies&rsquo; maids tripping about in neat morning dresses. After seeing for a long time little but rusticity, their lively manner, and gay inviting appearance, pleased me so much, that I thought, for the moment, I could have been a knight-errant for them.</p>
<p class="p24">We then got into a low one-horse chair, ordered for us by the Duke, in which we drove about the place. Dr. Johnson was much struck by the grandeur and elegance of this princely seat. He thought, however, the castle too low, and wished it had been a story higher. He said, &lsquo;What I admire here, is the total defiance of expence.&rsquo; I had a particular pride in shewing him a great number of fine old trees, to compensate for the nakedness which had made such an impression on him on the eastern coast of Scotland.</p>
<p class="p24">When we came in, before dinner, we found the duke and some gentlemen in the hall. Dr. Johnson took much notice of the large collection of arms, which are excellently disposed there. I told what he had said to Sir Alexander M&rsquo;Donald, of his ancestors not suffering their arms to rust. &lsquo;Well, (said the doctor,) but let us be glad we live in times when arms <span class="t8">may</span> rust. We can sit to-day at his grace&rsquo;s table, without any risk of being attacked, and perhaps sitting down again wounded or maimed.&rsquo; The duke placed Dr. Johnson next himself at table. I was in fine spirits; and though sensible that I had the misfortune of not being in favour with the duchess, I was not in the least disconcerted, and offered her grace some of the dish that was before me. It must be owned that I was in the right to be quite unconcerned, if I could. I was the Duke of Argyle&rsquo;s guest; and I had no reason to suppose that he adopted the prejudices and resentments of the Duchess of Hamilton.</p>
<p class="p24">I knew it was the rule of modern high life not to drink to any body; but that I might have the satisfaction for once to look the duchess in the face, with a glass in my hand, I with a respectful air addressed her,&mdash; &lsquo;My Lady Duchess, I have the honour to drink your grace&rsquo;s good health.&rsquo; I repeated the words audibly, and with a steady countenance. This was, perhaps, rather too much; but some allowance must be made for human feelings.</p>
<p class="p24">The duchess was very attentive to Dr. Johnson. I know not how a <span class="t8">middle state</span> came to be mentioned. Her grace wished to hear him on that point. &lsquo;Madam, (said he,) your own relation, Mr. Archibald Campbell, can tell you better about it than I can. He was a bishop of the nonjuring communion, and wrote a book upon the subject.&rsquo; He engaged to get it for her grace. He afterwards gave a full history of Mr. Archibald Campbell, which I am sorry I do not recollect particularly. He said, Mr. Campbell had been bred a violent Whig, but afterwards &lsquo;kept better company, and became a Tory.&rsquo; He said this with a smile, in pleasant allusion, as I thought, to the opposition between his own political principles and those of the duke&rsquo;s clan. He added that Mr. Campbell, after the revolution, was thrown into gaol on account of his tenets; but, on application by letter to the old Lord Townshend, was released; that he always spoke of his Lordship with great gratitude, saying, &lsquo;though a <span class="t8">Whig</span>, he had humanity.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Dr. Johnson and I passed some time together, in June 1784, at Pembroke College, Oxford, with the Reverend Dr. Adams, the master; and I having expressed a regret that my note relative to Mr. Archibald Campbell was imperfect, he was then so good as to write with his own hand, on the blank page of my <span class="t8">Journal</span>, opposite to that which contains what I have now mentioned, the following paragraph; which, however, is not quite so full as the narrative he gave at Inverary: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;<span class="t8">The Honourable</span> ARCHIBALD CAMPBELL <span class="t8">was, I believe, the Nephew of the Marquis of Argyle. He began life by engaging in Monmouth&rsquo;s rebellion, and, to escape the law, lived some time in Surinam. When he returned, he became zealous for episcopacy and monarchy; and at the Revolution adhered not only to the Nonjurors, but to those who refused to communicate with the Church of England, or to be present at any worship where the usurper was mentioned as king. He was, I believe, more than once apprehended in the reign of King William, and once at the accession of George. He was the familiar friend of Hicks and Nelson; a man of letters, but injudicious; and very curious and inquisitive, but credulous. He lived in 1743, or 44, about 75 years old.&rsquo;</span> The subject of luxury having been introduced, Dr. Johnson defended it. &lsquo;We have now (said he) a splendid dinner before us; which of all these dishes is unwholesome?&rsquo; The duke asserted, that he had observed the grandees of Spain diminished in their size by luxury. Dr. Johnson politely refrained from opposing directly an observation which the duke himself had made; but said, &lsquo;Man must be very different from other animals, if he is diminished by good living; for the size of all other animals is increased by it.&rsquo; I made some remark that seemed to imply a belief in <span class="t8">second sight</span>. The duchess said, &lsquo;I fancy you will be a <span class="t8">Methodist</span>.&rsquo; This was the only sentence her grace deigned to utter to me; and I take it for granted, she thought it a good hit on my <span class="t8">credulity</span> in the Douglas cause.</p>
<p class="p24">A gentleman in company, after dinner, was desired by the duke to go to another room, for a specimen of curious marble, which his grace wished to shew us. He brought a wrong piece, upon which the duke sent him back again. He could not refuse; but, to avoid any appearance of servility, he whistled as he walked out of the room, to shew his independency. On my mentioning this afterwards to Dr. Johnson, he said, it was a nice trait of character.</p>
<p class="p24">Dr. Johnson talked a great deal, and was so entertaining, that Lady Betty Hamilton, after dinner, went and placed her chair close to his, leaned upon the back of it, and listened eagerly. It would have made a fine picture to have drawn the Sage and her at this time in their several attitudes. He did not know, all the while, how much he was honoured. I told him afterwards. I never saw him so gentle and complaisant as this day.</p>
<p class="p24">We went to tea. The duke and I walked up and down the drawing-room, conversing. The duchess still continued to shew the same marked coldness for me; for which, though I suffered from it, I made every allowance, considering the very warm part that I had taken for Douglas, in the cause in which she thought her son deeply interested. Had not her grace discovered some displeasure towards me, I should have suspected her of insensibility or dissimulation.</p>
<p class="p24">Her grace made Dr. Johnson come and sit by her, and asked him why he made his journey so late in the year. &lsquo;Why, madam, (said he,) you know Mr. Boswell must attend the Court of Session, and it does not rise till the twelfth of August.&rsquo; She said, with some sharpness, &lsquo;I <span class="t8">know nothing</span> of Mr. Boswell.&rsquo; Poor Lady Lucy Douglas, to whom I mentioned this, observed, &lsquo;She knew <span class="t8">too much</span> of Mr. Boswell.&rsquo; I shall make no remark on her grace&rsquo;s speech. I indeed felt it as rather too severe; but when I recollected that my punishment was inflicted by so dignified a beauty, I had that kind of consolation which a man would feel who is strangled by a <span class="t8">silken cord</span>. Dr. Johnson was all attention to her grace. He used afterwards a droll expression, upon her enjoying the three titles of Hamilton, Brandon, and Argyle. Borrowing an image from the Turkish empire, he called her a <span class="t8">Duchess</span> with <span class="t8">three tails</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">He was much pleased with our visit at the castle of Inverary. The Duke of Argyle was exceedingly polite to him, and upon his complaining of the shelties which he had hitherto ridden being too small for him, his grace told him he should be provided with a good horse to carry him next day.</p>
<p class="p24">Mr. John M&rsquo;Aulay passed the evening with us at our inn. When Dr. Johnson spoke of people whose principles were good, but whose practice was faulty, Mr. M&rsquo;Aulay said, he had no notion of people being in earnest in their good professions, whose practice was not suitable to them. The Doctor grew warm, and said, &lsquo;Sir, you are so grossly ignorant of human nature, as not to know that a man may be very sincere in good principles, without having good practice!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Dr. Johnson was unquestionably in the right; and whoever examines himself candidly, will be satisfied of it, though the inconsistency between principles and practice is greater in some men than in others.</p>
<p class="p24">I recollect very little of this night&rsquo;s conversation. I am sorry that indolence came upon me towards the conclusion of our journey, so that I did not write down what passed with the same assiduity as during the greatest part of it.</p>
<p class="p24">TUESDAY, OCTOBER 26.</p>
<p class="p24">Mr. M&rsquo;Aulay breakfasted with us, nothing hurt or dismayed by his last night&rsquo;s correction. Being a man of good sense, he had a just admiration of Dr. Johnson.</p>
<p class="p24">Either yesterday morning, or this, I communicated to Dr. Johnson, from Mr. M&rsquo;Aulay&rsquo;s information, the news that Dr. Beattie had got a pension of two hundred pounds a year. He sat up in his bed, clapped his hands, and cried, &lsquo;O brave we!&rsquo; &mdash; a peculiar exclamation of his when he rejoices.</p>
<p class="p24">As we sat over our tea, Mr. Home&rsquo;s tragedy of <span class="t8">Douglas</span> was mentioned. I put Dr. Johnson in mind, that once, in a coffee house at Oxford, he called to old Mr. Sheridan, &lsquo;How came you, Sir, to give Home a gold medal for writing that foolish play?&rsquo; and defied Mr. Sheridan to shew ten good lines in it. He did not insist they should be together; but that there were not ten good lines in the whole play. He now persisted in this. I endeavoured to defend that pathetick and beautiful tragedy, and repeated the following passage: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash; &lsquo;Sincerity,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou first of virtues! let no mortal leave</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy onward path, although the earth should gape,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And from the gulph of hell destruction cry,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To take dissimulation&rsquo;s winding way.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">JOHNSON. &lsquo;That will not do, Sir. Nothing is good but what is consistent with truth or probability, which this is not. Juvenal, indeed, gives us a noble picture of inflexible virtue: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Esto bonus miles, tutor bonus, arbiter idem</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Integer: ambiguae si quando citabere testis,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Incertaeque rei, Phalaris licet imperet ut sis,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Falsus, et admoto dictet perjuria tauro,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Summum crede nefas animam praeferre pudori,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Et propter vitam vivendi perdere causas.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He repeated the lines with great force and dignity; then added, &lsquo;And, after this, comes Johnny Home, with his <span class="t8">earth gaping</span>, and his <span class="t8">destruction crying</span>: &mdash; Pooh!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">While we were lamenting the number of ruined religious buildings which we had lately seen, I spoke with peculiar feeling of the miserable neglect of the chapel belonging to the palace of Holyrood-house, in which are deposited the remains of many of the Kings of Scotland, and many of our nobility. I said, it was a disgrace to the country that it was not repaired: and particularly complained that my friend Douglas, the representative of a great house and proprietor of a vast estate, should suffer the sacred spot where his mother lies interred, to be unroofed, and exposed to all the inclemencies of the weather. Dr. Johnson, who, I know not how, had formed an opinion on the Hamilton side, in the Douglas cause, slily answered, &lsquo;Sir, Sir, don&rsquo;t be too severe upon the gentleman; don&rsquo;t accuse him of want of filial piety! Lady Jane Douglas was not <span class="t8">his</span> mother.&rsquo; He roused my zeal so much that I took the liberty to tell him he knew nothing of the cause: which I do most seriously believe was the case.</p>
<p class="p24">We were now &lsquo;in a country of bridles and saddles,&rsquo; and set out fully equipped. The Duke of Argyle was obliging enough to mount Dr. Johnson on a stately steed from his grace&rsquo;s stable. My friend was highly pleased, and Joseph said, &lsquo;He now looks like a bishop.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">We dined at the inn at Tarbat, and at night came to Rosedow, the beautiful seat of Sir James Colquhoun, on the banks of Lochlomond, where I, and any friends whom I have introduced, have ever been received with kind and elegant hospitality.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 27.</span></p>
<p class="p21">When I went into Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s room this morning, I observed to him how wonderfully courteous he had been at Inveraray, and said, &lsquo;You were quite a fine gentleman, when with the duchess.&rsquo; He answered, in good humour, &lsquo;Sir, I look upon myself as a very polite man:&rsquo; and he was right, in a proper manly sense of the word. As an immediate proof of it, let me observe, that he would not send back the Duke of Argyle&rsquo;s horse without a letter of thanks, which I copied.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF ARGYLE.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;MY LORD,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;That kindness which disposed your grace to supply me with the horse, which I have now returned, will make you pleased to hear that he has carried me well.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;By my diligence in the little commission with which I was honoured by the duchess, I will endeavour to shew how highly I value the favours which I have received, and how much I desire to be thought,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;My Lord,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your Grace&rsquo;s most obedient,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;And most humble servant,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Rosedow, Oct. 29, 1773.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">The duke was so attentive to his respectable guest, that on the same day, he wrote him an answer, which was received at Auchinleck: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;TO DR. JOHNSON, AUCHINLECK, AYRSHIRE.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;SIR, &lsquo;I am glad to hear your journey from this place was not unpleasant, in regard to your horse. I wish I could have supplied you with good weather, which I am afraid you felt the want of.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The Duchess of Argyle desires her compliments to you, and is much obliged to you for remembering her commission.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am, Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your most obedient humble servant,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;ARGYLE.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Inveraray, Oct. 29, 1773.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I am happy to insert every memorial of the honour done to my great friend. Indeed, I was at all times desirous to preserve the letters which he received from eminent persons, of which, as of all other papers, he was very negligent; and I once proposed to him, that they should be committed to my care, as his <span class="t8">Custos Rotulorum</span>. I wish he had complied with my request, as by that means many valuable writings might have been preserved, that are now lost.</p>
<p class="p24">After breakfast, Dr. Johnson and I were furnished with a boat, and sailed about upon Lochlomond, and landed on some of the islands which are interspersed. He was much pleased with the scene, which is so well known by the accounts of various travellers, that it is unnecessary for me to attempt any description of it.</p>
<p class="p24">I recollect none of his conversation, except that, when talking of dress, he said, &lsquo;Sir, were I to have any thing fine, it should be very fine. Were I to wear a ring, it should not be a bauble, but a stone of great value. Were I to wear a laced or embroidered waistcoat, it should be very rich. I had once a very rich laced waistcoat, which I wore the first night of my tragedy.&rsquo; Lady Helen Colquhoun being a very pious woman, the conversation, after dinner, took a religious turn. Her ladyship defended the presbyterian mode of publick worship; upon which Dr. Johnson delivered those excellent arguments for a form of prayer which he has introduced into his <span class="t8">Journey</span>. I am myself fully convinced that a form of prayer for publick worship is in general most decent and edifying. <span class="t8">Solennia verba</span> have a kind of prescriptive sanctity, and make a deeper impression on the mind than extemporaneous effusions, in which, as we know not what they are to be, we cannot readily acquiesce. Yet I would allow also of a certain portion of extempore address, as occasion may require. This is the practice of the French Protestant churches. And although the office of forming supplications to the throne of Heaven is, in my mind, too great a trust to be indiscriminately committed to the discretion of every minister, I do not mean to deny that sincere devotion may be experienced when joining in prayer with those who use no Liturgy.</p>
<p class="p24">We were favoured with Sir James Colquhoun&rsquo;s coach to convey us in the evening to Cameron, the seat of Commissary Smollet. Our satisfaction of finding ourselves again in a comfortable carriage was very great. We had a pleasing conviction of the commodiousness of civilization, and heartily laughed at the ravings of those absurd visionaries who have attempted to persuade us of the superior advantages of a <span class="t8">state of nature</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">Mr. Smollet was a man of considerable learning, with abundance of animal spirits; so that he was a very good companion for Dr. Johnson, who said to me, &lsquo;We have had more solid talk here than at any place where we have been.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I remember Dr. Johnson gave us this evening an able and eloquent discourse on the <span class="t8">Origin of Evil</span>, and on the consistency of moral evil with the power and goodness of GOD. He shewed us how it arose from our free agency, an extinction of which would be a still greater evil than any we experience. I know not that he said any thing absolutely new, but he said a great deal wonderfully well; and perceiving us to be delighted and satisfied, he concluded his harangue with an air of benevolent triumph over an objection which has distressed many worthy minds: &lsquo;This then is the answer to the question, <span class="t8">Pothen to Kakon</span>?&rsquo; Mrs. Smollet whispered me, that it was the best sermon she had ever heard. Much do I upbraid myself for having neglected to preserve it.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">THURSDAY, OCTOBER 28.</span></p>
<p class="p21">Mr. Smollet pleased Dr. Johnson, by producing a collection of newspapers in the time of the Usurpation, from which it appeared that all sorts of crimes were very frequent during that horrible anarchy. By the side of the high road to Glasgow, at some distance from his house, he had erected a pillar to the memory of his ingenious kinsman, Dr. Smollet; and he consulted Dr. Johnson as to an inscription for it. Lord Kames, who, though he had a great store of knowledge, with much ingenuity, and uncommon activity of mind, was no profound scholar, had it seems recommended an English inscription. Dr. Johnson treated this with great contempt, saying, &lsquo;An English inscription would be a disgrace to Dr. Smollet;&rsquo; and, in answer to what Lord Kames had urged, as to the advantage of its being in English, because it would be generally understood, I observed, that all to whom Dr. Smollet&rsquo;s merit could be an object of respect and imitation, would understand it as well in Latin; and that surely it was not meant for the Highland drovers, or other such people, who pass and repass that way.</p>
<p class="p24">We were then shewn a Latin inscription, proposed for this monument. Dr. Johnson sat down with an ardent and liberal earnestness to revise it, and greatly improved it by several additions and variations. I unfortunately did not take a copy of it, as it originally stood; but I have happily preserved every fragment of what Dr. Johnson wrote: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quisquis ades, viator,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vel mente felix, vel studiis cultus,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Immorare paululum memoriae</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TOBIAE SMOLLET, M.D.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Viri iis virtutibus</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quas in homine et cive</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Et laudes, et imiteris,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Postquam mira &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Se &mdash;&mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tali tantoque viro, suo patrueli,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hanc columnam,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amoris eheu! inane monumentum,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In ipsis Leviniae ripis,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quas primis infans vagitibus personuit,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Versiculisque jam fere moriturus illustravit,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ponendam curavit.</p>
<p class="p24">We had this morning a singular proof of Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s quick and retentive memory. Hay&rsquo;s translation of <span class="t8">Martial</span> was lying in a window. I said, I thought it was pretty well done, and shewed him a particular epigram, I think, of ten, but am certain of eight, lines. He read it, and tossed away the book, saying&mdash; &lsquo;No, it is not pretty well.&rsquo; As I persisted in my opinion, he said, &lsquo;Why, Sir, the original is thus,&rsquo; &mdash; (and he repeated it;) &lsquo;and this man&rsquo;s translation is thus,&rsquo; &mdash; and then he repeated that also, exactly, though he had never seen it before, and read it over only once, and that too, without any intention of getting it by heart.</p>
<p class="p24">Here a post-chaise, which I had ordered from Glasgow, came for us, and we drove on in high spirits. We stopped at Dunbarton, and though the approach to the castle there is very steep, Dr. Johnson ascended it with alacrity, and surveyed all that was to be seen. During the whole of our Tour he shewed uncommon spirit, could not bear to be treated like an old or infirm man, and was very unwilling to accept of any assistance, insomuch that, at our landing at Icolmkill, when Sir Allan M&rsquo;Lean and I submitted to be carried on men&rsquo;s shoulders from the boat to the shore, as it could not be brought quite close to land, he sprang into the sea, and waded vigorously out. On our arrival at the Saracen&rsquo;s Head Inn, at Glasgow, I was made happy by good accounts from home; and Dr. Johnson, who had not received a single letter since we left Aberdeen, found here a great many, the perusal of which entertained him much. He enjoyed in imagination the comforts which we could now command, and seemed to be in high glee. I remember, he put a leg up on each side of the grate, and said, with a mock solemnity, by way of soliloquy, but loud enough for me to hear it, &lsquo;Here am I, an ENGLISH man, sitting by a <span class="t8">coal</span> fire.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">FRIDAY, OCTOBER 29.</span></p>
<p class="p21">The professors of the University being informed of our arrival, Dr. Stevenson, Dr. Reid, and Mr. Anderson breakfasted with us. Mr. Anderson accompanied us while Dr. Johnson viewed this beautiful city. He had told me, that one day in London, when Dr. Adam Smith was boasting of it, he turned to him and said, &lsquo;Pray, Sir, have you ever seen Brentford?&rsquo; This was surely a strong instance of his impatience, and spirit of contradiction. I put him in mind of it to-day, while he expressed his admiration of the elegant buildings, and whispered him, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you feel some remorse?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">We were received in the college by a number of the professors, who shewed all due respect to Dr. Johnson; and then we paid a visit to the principal, Dr. Leechman, at his own house, where Dr. Johnson had the satisfaction of being told that his name had been gratefully celebrated in one of the parochial congregations in the Highlands, as the person to whose influence it was chiefly owing that the New Testament was allowed to be translated into the Erse language. It seems some political members of the Society in Scotland for propagating Christian Knowledge had opposed this pious undertaking, as tending to preserve the distinction between the Highlanders and Lowlanders. Dr. Johnson wrote a long letter upon the subject to a friend, which being shewn to them, made them ashamed, and afraid of being publickly exposed; so they were forced to a compliance. It is now in my possession, and is, perhaps, one of the best productions of his masterly pen.</p>
<p class="p24">Professors Reid and Anderson, and the two Messieurs Foulis, the Elzevirs of Glasgow, dined and drank tea with us at our inn, after which the professors went away; and I, having a letter to write, left my fellow-traveller with Messieurs Foulis. Though good and ingenious men, they had that unsettled speculative mode of conversation which is offensive to a man regularly taught at an English school and university. I found that, instead of listening to the dictates of the Sage, they had teazed him with questions and doubtful disputations. He came in a flutter to me, and desired I might come back again, for he could not bear these men. &lsquo;O ho! Sir, (said I,) you are flying to me for refuge!&rsquo; He never, in any situation, was at a loss for a ready repartee. He answered, with a quick vivacity, &lsquo;It is of two evils choosing the least.&rsquo; I was delighted with this flash bursting from the cloud which hung upon his mind, closed my letter directly, and joined the company.</p>
<p class="p24">We supped at Professor Anderson&rsquo;s. The general impression upon my memory is, that we had not much conversation at Glasgow, where the professors, like their brethren at Aberdeen, did not venture to expose themselves much to the battery of cannon which they knew might play upon them. Dr. Johnson, who was fully conscious of his own superior powers, afterwards praised Principal Robertson for his caution in this respect. He said to me, &lsquo;Robertson, Sir, was in the right. Robertson is a man of eminence, and the head of a college at Edinburgh. He had a character to maintain, and did well not to risk its being lessened.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">SATURDAY, OCTOBER 30.</span></p>
<p class="p21">We set out towards Ayrshire. I sent Joseph on to Loudoun, with a message, that, if the Earl was at home, Dr. Johnson and I would have the honour to dine with him. Joseph met us on the road, and reported that the Earl &lsquo;<span class="t8">jumped for joy,</span>&rsquo; and said, &lsquo;I shall be very happy to see them.&rsquo; We were received with a most pleasing courtesy by his Lordship, and by the Countess his mother, who, in her ninety-fifth year, had all her faculties quite unimpaired. This was a very cheering sight to Dr. Johnson, who had an extraordinary desire for long life. Her ladyship was sensible and well-informed, and had seen a great deal of the world. Her lord had held several high offices, and she was sister to the great Earl of Stair.</p>
<p class="p24">I cannot here refrain from paying a just tribute to the character of John Earl of Loudoun, who did more service to the county of Ayr in general, as well as to the individuals in it, than any man we have ever had. It is painful to think that he met with much ingratitude from persons both in high and low rank: but such was his temper, such his knowledge of &lsquo;base mankind,&rsquo; that, as if he had expected no other return, his mind was never soured, and he retained his good-humour and benevolence to the last. The tenderness of his heart was proved in 1745-6, when he had an important command in the Highlands, and behaved with a generous humanity to the unfortunate. I cannot figure a more honest politician; for, though his interest in our county was great, and generally successful, he not only did not deceive by fallacious promises, but was anxious that people should not deceive themselves by too sanguine expectations. His kind and dutiful attention to his mother was unremitted. At his house was true hospitality; a plain but a plentiful table; and every guest, being left at perfect freedom, felt himself quite easy and happy. While I live, I shall honour the memory of this amiable man.</p>
<p class="p24">At night, we advanced a few miles farther, to the house of Mr. Campbell of Treesbank, who was married to one of my wife&rsquo;s sisters, and were entertained very agreeably by a worthy couple.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">SUNDAY, OCTOBER 31.</span></p>
<p class="p21">We reposed here in tranquillity. Dr. Johnson was pleased to find a numerous and excellent collection of books, which had mostly belonged to the Reverend Mr. John Campbell, brother of our host. I was desirous to have procured for my fellow-traveller, to-day, the company of Sir John Cuninghame, of Caprington, whose castle was but two miles from us. He was a very distinguished scholar, was long abroad, and during part of the time lived much with the learned Cuninghame, the opponent of Bentley as a critick upon Horace. He wrote Latin with great elegance, and, what is very remarkable, read Homer and Ariosto through every year. I wrote to him to request he would come to us; but unfortunately he was prevented by indisposition.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">MONDAY, NOVEMBER 1.</span></p>
<p class="p21">Though Dr. Johnson was lazy, and averse to move, I insisted that he should go with me, and pay a visit to the Countess of Eglintoune, mother of the late and present earl. I assured him, he would find himself amply recompensed for the trouble; and he yielded to my solicitations, though with some unwillingness. We were well mounted, and had not many miles to ride. He talked of the attention that is necessary in order to distribute our charity judiciously. &lsquo;If thoughtlessly done, we may neglect the most deserving objects; and, as every man has but a certain proportion to give, if it is lavished upon those who first present themselves, there may be nothing left for such as have a better claim. A man should first relieve those who are nearly connected with him, by whatever tie; and then, if he has any thing to spare, may extend his bounty to a wider circle.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">As we passed very near the castle of Dundonald, which was one of the many residences of the kings of Scotland, and in which Robert the Second lived and died, Dr. Johnson wished to survey it particularly. It stands on a beautiful rising ground, which is seen at a great distance on several quarters, and from whence there is an extensive prospect of the rich district of Cuninghame, the western sea, the isle of Arran, and a part of the northern coast of Ireland. It has long been unroofed; and, though of considerable size, we could not, by any power of imagination, figure it as having been a suitable habitation for majesty. Dr. Johnson, to irritate my <span class="t8">old Scottish</span> enthusiasm, was very jocular on the homely accommodation of &lsquo;King <span class="t8">Bob</span>,&rsquo; and roared and laughed till the ruins echoed.</p>
<p class="p24">Lady Eglintoune, though she was now in her eighty-fifth year, and had lived in the retirement of the country for almost half a century, was still a very agreeable woman. She was of the noble house of Kennedy, and had all the elevation which the consciousness of such birth inspires. Her figure was majestick, her manners high-bred, her reading extensive, and her conversation elegant. She had been the admiration of the gay circles of life, and the patroness of poets. Dr. Johnson was delighted with his reception here. Her principles in church and state were congenial with his. She knew all his merit, and had heard much of him from her son, Earl Alexander, who loved to cultivate the acquaintance of men of talents, in every department.</p>
<p class="p24">All who knew his lordship, will allow that his understanding and accomplishments were of no ordinary rate. From the gay habits which he had early acquired, he spent too much of his time with men, and in pursuits far beneath such a mind as his. He afterwards became sensible of it, and turned his thoughts to objects of importance; but was cut off in the prime of his life. I cannot speak, but with emotions of the most affectionate regret, of one, in whose company many of my early days were passed, and to whose kindness I was much indebted.</p>
<p class="p24">Often must I have occasion to upbraid myself, that soon after our return to the main land, I allowed indolence to prevail over me so much, as to shrink from the labour of continuing my journal with the same minuteness as before; sheltering myself in the thought, that we had done with the Hebrides; and not considering, that Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s Memorabilia were likely to be more valuable when we were restored to a more polished society. Much has thus been irrecoverably lost.</p>
<p class="p24">In the course of our conversation this day, it came out, that Lady Eglintoune was married the year before Dr. Johnson was born; upon which she graciously said to him, that she might have been his mother; and that she now adopted him; and when we were going away, she embraced him, saying, &lsquo;My dear son, farewell!&rsquo; My friend was much pleased with this day&rsquo;s entertainment, and owned that I had done well to force him out.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 2.</span></p>
<p class="p21">We were now in a country not only &lsquo;<span class="t8">of saddles and bridles</span>,&rsquo; but of post-chaises; and having ordered one from Kilmarnock, we got to Auchinleck before dinner.</p>
<p class="p24">My father was not quite a year and a half older than Dr. Johnson; but his conscientious discharge of his laborious duty as a judge in Scotland, where the law proceedings are almost all in writing, &mdash; a severe complaint which ended in his death, &mdash; and the loss of my mother, a woman of almost unexampled piety and goodness, &mdash; had before this time in some degree affected his spirits, and rendered him less disposed to exert his faculties: for he had originally a very strong mind, and cheerful temper. He assured me, he never had felt one moment of what is called low spirits, or uneasiness, without a real cause. He had a great many good stories, which he told uncommonly well, and he was remarkable for &lsquo;humour, <span class="t8">incolumi gravitate</span>,&rsquo; as Lord Monboddo used to characterise it. His age, his office, and his character, had long given him an acknowledged claim to great attention, in whatever company he was; and he could ill brook any diminution of it. He was as sanguine a Whig and Presbyterian, as Dr. Johnson was a Tory and Church of England man: and as he had not much leisure to be informed of Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s great merits by reading his works, he had a partial and unfavourable notion of him, founded on his supposed political tenets; which were so discordant to his own, that instead of speaking of him with that respect to which he was entitled, he used to call him &lsquo;a <span class="t8">Jacobite fellow</span>.&rsquo; Knowing all this, I should not have ventured to bring them together, had not my father, out of kindness to me, desired me to invite Dr. Johnson to his house.</p>
<p class="p24">I was very anxious that all should be well; and begged of my friend to avoid three topicks, as to which they differed very widely; Whiggism, Presbyterianism, and &mdash; Sir John Pringle. He said courteously, &lsquo;I shall certainly not talk on subjects which I am told are disagreeable to a gentleman under whose roof I am; especially, I shall not do so to <span class="t8">your father</span>.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Our first day went off very smoothly. It rained, and we could not get out; but my father shewed Dr. Johnson his library, which in curious editions of the Greek and Roman classicks, is, I suppose, not excelled by any private collection in Great Britain. My father had studied at Leyden, and been very intimate with the Gronovii, and other learned men there. He was a sound scholar, and, in particular, had collated manuscripts and different editions of <span class="t8">Anacreon</span>, and others of the Greek Lyrick poets, with great care; so that my friend and he had much matter for conversation, without touching on the fatal topicks of difference.</p>
<p class="p24">Dr. Johnson found here Baxter&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Anacreon</span>, which he told me he had long enquired for in vain, and began to suspect there was no such book. Baxter was the keen antagonist of Barnes. His life is in the <span class="t8">Biographia Britannica</span>. My father has written many notes on this book, and Dr. Johnson and I talked of having it reprinted.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 3.</span></p>
<p class="p21">It rained all day, and gave Dr. Johnson an impression of that incommodiousness of climate in the west, of which he has taken notice in his <span class="t8">Journey</span>; but, being well accommodated, and furnished with variety of books, he was not dissatisfied.</p>
<p class="p24">Some gentlemen of the neighbourhood came to visit my father; but there was little conversation. One of them asked Dr. Johnson how he liked the Highlands. The question seemed to irritate him, for he answered, &lsquo;How, Sir, can you ask me what obliges me to speak unfavourably of a country where I have been hospitably entertained? Who <span class="t8">can</span> like the Highlands? I like the inhabitants very well.&rsquo; The gentleman asked no more questions.</p>
<p class="p24">Let me now make up for the present neglect, by again gleaning from the past. At Lord Monboddo&rsquo;s, after the conversation upon the decrease of learning in England, his Lordship mentioned <span class="t8">Hermes</span>, by Mr. Harris of Salisbury, as the work of a living authour, for whom he had a great respect. Dr. Johnson said nothing at the time; but when we were in our post-chaise, he told me, he thought Harris &lsquo;a coxcomb.&rsquo; This he said of him, not as a man, but as an authour; and I give his opinions of men and books, faithfully, whether they agree with my own or not. I do admit, that there always appeared to me something of affectation in Mr. Harris&rsquo;s manner of writing; something of a habit of clothing plain thoughts in analytick and categorical formality. But all his writings are imbued with learning; and all breathe that philanthropy and amiable disposition, which distinguished him as a man.</p>
<p class="p24">At another time, during our Tour, he drew the character of a rapacious Highland Chief with the strength of Theophrastus or la Bruyère; concluding with these words:&mdash; &lsquo;Sir, he has no more the soul of a Chief, than an attorney who has twenty houses in a street, and considers how much he can make by them.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He this day, when we were by ourselves, observed, how common it was for people to talk from books; to retail the sentiment&rsquo;s of others, and not their own; in short, to converse without any originality of thinking. He was pleased to say, &lsquo;You and I do not talk from books.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 4.</span></p>
<p class="p21">I was glad to have at length a very fine day, on which I could shew Dr. Johnson the <span class="t8">Place</span> of my family, which he has honoured with so much attention in his <span class="t8">Journey</span>. He is, however, mistaken in thinking that the Celtick name, <span class="t8">Auchinleck</span>, has no relation to the natural appearance of it. I believe every Celtick name of a place will be found very descriptive. <span class="t8">Auchinleck</span> does not signify a <span class="t8">stony field</span>, as he has said, but a <span class="t8">field of flag stones</span>; and this place has a number of rocks, which abound in strata of that kind. The &lsquo;sullen dignity of the old castle,&rsquo; as he has forcibly expressed it, delighted him exceedingly. On one side of the rock on which its ruins stand, runs the river Lugar, which is here of considerable breadth, and is bordered by other high rocks, shaded with wood. On the other side runs a brook, skirted in the same manner, but on a smaller scale. I cannot figure a more romantick scene.</p>
<p class="p24">I felt myself elated here, and expatiated to my illustrious Mentor on the antiquity and honourable alliances of my family, and on the merits of its founder, Thomas Boswell, who was highly favoured by his sovereign, James IV. of Scotland, and fell with him at the battle of Flodden-field; and in the glow of what, I am sensible, will, in a commercial age, be considered as genealogical enthusiasm, did not omit to mention what I was sure my friend would not think lightly of, my relation to the Royal Personage, whose liberality, on his accession to the throne, had given him comfort and independence. I have, in a former page, acknowledged my pride of ancient blood, in which I was encouraged by Dr. Johnson: my readers therefore will not be surprised at my having indulged it on this occasion.</p>
<p class="p24">Not far from the old castle is a spot of consecrated earth, on which may be traced the foundations of an ancient chapel, dedicated to St. Vincent, and where in old times &lsquo;was the place of graves&rsquo; for the family. It grieves me to think that the remains of sanctity here, which were considerable, were dragged away, and employed in building a part of the house of Auchinleck, of the middle age; which was the family residence, till my father erected that &lsquo;elegant modern mansion,&rsquo; of which Dr. Johnson speaks so handsomely. Perhaps this chapel may one day be restored.</p>
<p class="p24">Dr. Johnson was pleased when I shewed him some venerable old trees, under the shade of which my ancestors had walked. He exhorted me to plant assiduously, as my father had done to a great extent.</p>
<p class="p24">As I wandered with my reverend friend in the groves of Auchinleck, I told him, that, if I survived him, it was my intention to erect a monument to him here, among scenes which, in my mind, were all classical; for in my youth I had appropriated to them many of the descriptions of the Roman poets. He could not bear to have death presented to him in any shape; for his constitutional melancholy made the king of terrours more frightful. He turned off the subject, saying, &lsquo;Sir, I hope to see your grand-children!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">This forenoon he observed some cattle without horns, of which he has taken notice in his <span class="t8">Journey</span>, and seems undecided whether they be of a particular race. His doubts appear to have had no foundation; for my respectable neighbour, Mr. Fairlie, who, with all his attention to agriculture, finds time both for the classicks and his friends, assures me they are a distinct species, and that, when any of their calves have horns, a mixture of breed can be traced. In confirmation of his opinion, he pointed out to me the following passage in Tacitus,&mdash; &lsquo;<span class="t8">Ne armentis quidem suus honor, aut gloria frontis</span>;&rsquo; (<span class="t8">De mor. Germ. § 5</span>) which he wondered had escaped Dr. Johnson.</p>
<p class="p24">On the front of the house of Auchinleck is this inscription: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Quod petis, hic est;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Est Ulubris; animus si te non deficit aequus.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">It is characteristick of the founder; but the <span class="t8">animus aequus</span> is, alas! not inheritable, nor the subject of devise. He always talked to me as if it were in a man&rsquo;s own power to attain it; but Dr. Johnson told me that he owned to him, when they were alone, his persuasion that it was in a great measure constitutional, or the effect of causes which do not depend on ourselves, and that Horace boasts too much, when he says, <span class="t8">aequum mi animum ipse parabo</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 5.</span></p>
<p class="p21">The Reverend Mr. Dun, our parish minister, who had dined with us yesterday, with some other company, insisted that Dr. Johnson and I should dine with him to-day. This gave me an opportunity to shew my friend the road to the church, made by my father at a great expence, for above three miles, on his own estate, through a range of well enclosed farms, with a row of trees on each side of it. He called it the <span class="t8">Via sacra</span>, and was very fond of it.Dr. Johnson, though he held notions far distant from those of the Presbyterian clergy, yet could associate on good terms with them. He indeed occasionally attacked them. One of them discovered a narrowness of information concerning the dignitaries of the Church of England, among whom may be found men of the greatest learning, virtue, and piety, and of a truly apostolic character. He talked before Dr. Johnson, of fat bishops and drowsy deans; and, in short, seemed to believe the illiberal and profane scoffings of professed satyrists, or vulgar railers. Dr. Johnson was so highly offended, that he said to him, &lsquo;Sir, you know no more of our Church than a Hottentot.&rsquo; I was sorry that he brought this upon himself.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 6.</span></p>
<p class="p21">I cannot be certain, whether it was on this day, or a former, that Dr. Johnson and my father came in collision. If I recollect right, the contest began while my father was shewing him his collection of medals; and Oliver Cromwell&rsquo;s coin unfortunately introduced Charles the First, and Toryism. They became exceedingly warm, and violent, and I was very much distressed by being present at such an altercation between two men, both of whom I reverenced; yet I durst not interfere. It would certainly be very unbecoming in me to exhibit my honoured father, and my respected friend, as intellectual gladiators, for the entertainment of the publick: and therefore I suppress what would, I dare say, make an interesting scene in this dramatick sketch, &mdash; this account of the transit of Johnson over the Caledonian Hemisphere.</p>
<p class="p24">Yet I think I may, without impropriety, mention one circumstance, as an instance of my father&rsquo;s address. Dr. Johnson challenged him, as he did us all at Talisker, to point out any theological works of merit written by Presbyterian ministers in Scotland. My father, whose studies did not lie much in that way, owned to me afterwards, that he was somewhat at a loss how to answer, but that luckily he recollected having read in catalogues the title of <span class="t8">Durham on the Galatians</span>; upon which he boldly said, &lsquo;Pray, Sir, have you read Mr. Durham&rsquo;s excellent commentary on the Galatians?&rsquo; &lsquo;No, Sir,&rsquo; said Dr. Johnson. By this lucky thought my father kept him at bay, and for some time enjoyed his triumph; but his antagonist soon made a retort, which I forbear to mention.</p>
<p class="p24">In the course of their altercation, Whiggism and Presbyterianism, Toryism and Episcopacy, were terribly buffeted. My worthy hereditary friend, Sir John Pringle, never having been mentioned, happily escaped without a bruise.</p>
<p class="p24">My father&rsquo;s opinion of Dr. Johnson may be conjectured from the name he afterwards gave him, which was URSA MAJOR. But it is not true, as has been reported, that it was in consequence of my saying that he was a <span class="t8">constellation</span> of genius and literature. It was a sly abrupt expression to one of his brethren on the bench of the Court of Session, in which Dr. Johnson was then standing; but it was not said in his hearing.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">SUNDAY, NOVEMBER 7.</span></p>
<p class="p21">My father and I went to publick worship in our parish-church, in which I regretted that Dr. Johnson would not join us; for, though we have there no form of prayer, nor magnificent solemnity, yet, as GOD is worshipped in spirit and in truth, and the same doctrines preached as in the Church of England, my friend would certainly have shewn more liberality, had he attended. I doubt not, however, but he employed his time in private to very good purpose. His uniform and fervent piety was manifested on many occasions during our Tour, which I have not mentioned. His reason for not joining in Presbyterian worship has been recorded in a former page.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">MONDAY, NOVEMBER 8.</span></p>
<p class="p21">Notwithstanding the altercation that had passed, my father, who had the dignified courtesy of an old Baron, was very civil to Dr. Johnson, and politely attended him to the post-chaise, which was to convey us to Edinburgh.</p>
<p class="p24">Thus they parted. They are now in another, and a higher, state of existence: and as they were both worthy Christian men, I trust they have met in happiness. But I must observe, in justice to my friend&rsquo;s political principles, and my own, that they have met in a place where there is no room for <span class="t8">Whiggism</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">We came at night to a good inn at Hamilton. I recollect no more.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 9.</span></p>
<p class="p21">I wished to have shewn Dr. Johnson the Duke of Hamilton&rsquo;s house, commonly called the <span class="t8">Palace</span> of Hamilton, which is close by the town. It is an object which, having been pointed out to me as a splendid edifice, from my earliest years, in travelling between Auchinleck and Edinburgh, has still great grandeur in my imagination. My friend consented to stop, and view the outside of it, but could not be persuaded to go into it.</p>
<p class="p24">We arrived this night at Edinburgh, after an absence of eighty-three days. For five weeks together, of the tempestuous season, there had been no account received of us. I cannot express how happy I was on finding myself again at home.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 10.</span></p>
<p class="p21">Old Mr. Drummond, the bookseller, came to breakfast. Dr. Johnson and he had not met for ten years. There was respect on his side, and kindness on Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s. Soon afterwards Lord Elibank came in, and was much pleased at seeing Dr. Johnson in Scotland. His lordship said, &lsquo;hardly any thing seemed to him more improbable.&rsquo; Dr. Johnson had a very high opinion of him. Speaking of him to me, he characterized him thus: &lsquo;Lord Elibank has read a great deal. It is true, I can find in books all that he has read; but he has a great deal of what is in books, proved by the test of real life.&rsquo; Indeed, there have been few men whose conversation discovered more knowledge enlivened by fancy. He published several small pieces of distinguished merit; and has left some in manuscript, in particular an account of the expedition against Carthagena, in which he served as an officer in the army. His writings deserve to be collected. He was the early patron of Dr. Robertson, the historian, and Mr. Home, the tragick poet; who, when they were ministers of country parishes, lived near his seat. He told me, &lsquo;I saw these lads had talents, and they were much with me.&rsquo; I hope they will pay a grateful tribute to his memory.</p>
<p class="p24">The morning was chiefly taken up by Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s giving him an account of our Tour. The subject of difference in political principles was introduced. JOHNSON. &lsquo;It is much increased by opposition. There was a violent Whig, with whom I used to contend with great eagerness. After his death I felt my Toryism much abated.&rsquo; I suppose he meant Mr. Walmsley of Lichfield, whose character he has drawn so well in his <span class="t8">Life of Edmund Smith</span>. Mr. Nairne came in, and he and I accompanied Dr. Johnson to Edinburgh Castle, which he owned was &lsquo;a great place.&rsquo; But I must mention, as a striking instance of that spirit of contradiction to which he had a strong propensity, when Lord Elibank was some days after talking of it with the natural elation of a Scotchman, or of any man who is proud of a stately fortress in his own country, Dr. Johnson affected to despise it, observing that &lsquo;it would make a good <span class="t8">prison</span> in ENGLAND.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Lest it should be supposed that I have suppressed one of his sallies against my country, it may not be improper here to correct a mistaken account that has been circulated, as to his conversation this day. It has been said, that being desired to attend to the noble prospect from the Castle-hill, he replied, &lsquo;Sir, the noblest prospect that a Scotchman ever sees, is the high road that leads him to London.&rsquo; This lively sarcasm was thrown out at a tavern in London, in my presence, many years before.</p>
<p class="p24">We had with us to-day at dinner, at my house, the Lady Dowager Colvill, and Lady Anne Erskine, sisters of the Earl of Kelly; the Honourable Archibald Erskine, who has now succeeded to that title; Lord Elibank; the Reverend Dr. Blair; Mr. Tytler, the acute vindicator of Mary Queen of Scots, and some other friends.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Fingal</span> being talked of, Dr. Johnson, who used to boast that he had, from the first, resisted both Ossian and the Giants of Patagonia, averred his positive disbelief of its authenticity. Lord Elibank said, &lsquo;I am sure it is not M&rsquo;Pherson&rsquo;s. Mr. Johnson, I keep company a great deal with you; it is known I do. I may borrow from you better things than I can say myself, and give them as my own; but, if I should, every body will know whose they are.&rsquo; The Doctor was not softened by this compliment. He denied merit to <span class="t8">Fingal</span>, supposing it to be the production of a man who has had the advantages that the present age affords; and said, &lsquo;nothing is more easy than to write enough in that style if once you begin.&rsquo;One gentleman in company expressing his opinion &lsquo;that <span class="t8">Fingal</span> was certainly genuine, for that he had heard a great part of it repeated in the original,&rsquo; Dr. Johnson indignantly asked him whether he understood the original; to which an answer being given in the negative, &lsquo;Why then, (said Dr. Johnson,) we see to what <span class="t8">this</span> testimony comes: &mdash; thus it is.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I mentioned this as a remarkable proof how liable the mind of man is to credulity, when not guarded by such strict examination as that which Dr. Johnson habitually practised.The talents and integrity of the gentleman who made the remark, are unquestionable; yet, had not Dr. Johnson made him advert to the consideration, that he who does not understand a language, cannot know that something which is recited to him is in that language, he might have believed, and reported to this hour, that he had &lsquo;heard a great part of <span class="t8">Fingal</span> repeated in the original.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">For the satisfaction of those on the north of the Tweed, who may think Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s account of Caledonian credulity and inaccuracy too strong, it is but fair to add, that he admitted the same kind of ready belief might be found in his own country. &lsquo;He would undertake, (he said) to write an epick poem on the story of <span class="t8">Robin Hood</span>, and half England, to whom the names and places he should mention in it are familiar, would believe and declare they had heard it from their earliest years.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">One of his objections to the authenticity of <span class="t8">Fingal</span>, during the conversation at Ulinish, is omitted in my <span class="t8">Journal</span>, but I perfectly recollect it. &lsquo;Why is not the original deposited in some publick library, instead of exhibiting attestations of its existence? Suppose there were a question in a court of justice, whether a man be dead or alive: You aver he is alive, and you bring fifty witnesses to swear it: I answer, &ldquo;Why do you not produce the man?&rdquo;&rsquo; This is an argument founded upon one of the first principles of the <span class="t8">law of evidence</span>, which <span class="t8">Gilbert</span> would have held to be irrefragable.</p>
<p class="p24">I do not think it incumbent on me to give any precise decided opinion upon this question, as to which I believe more than some, and less than others.</p>
<p class="p24">The subject appears to have now become very uninteresting to the publick. That <span class="t8">Fingal</span> is not from beginning to end a translation from the Gallick, but that <span class="t8">some</span> passages have been supplied by the editor to connect the whole, I have heard admitted by very warm advocates for its authenticity. If this be the case, why are not these distinctly ascertained? Antiquaries, and admirers of the work, may complain, that they are in a situation similar to that of the unhappy gentleman, whose wife informed him, on her death-bed, that one of their reputed children was not his; and, when he eagerly begged her to declare which of them it was, she answered, &lsquo;<span class="t8">That</span> you shall never know;&rsquo; and expired, leaving him in irremediable doubt as to them all.</p>
<p class="p24">I beg leave now to say something upon <span class="t8">second sight</span>, of which I have related two instances, as they impressed my mind at the time. I own, I returned from the Hebrides with a considerable degree of faith in the many stories of that kind which I heard with a too easy acquiescence, without any close examination of the evidence: but, since that time, my belief in those stories has been much weakened, by reflecting on the careless inaccuracy of narrative in common matters, from which we may certainly conclude that there may be the same in what is more extraordinary. It is but just, however, to add, that the belief in second sight is not peculiar to the Highlands and Isles.</p>
<p class="p24">Some years after our Tour, a cause was tried in the Court of Session, where the principal fact to be ascertained was, whether a ship-master, who used to frequent the Western Highlands and Isles, was drowned in one particular year, or in the year after. A great number of witnesses from those parts were examined on each side, and swore directly contrary to each other, upon this simple question. One of them, a very respectable Chieftain, who told me a story of second sight, which I have not mentioned, but which I too implicitly believed, had in this case, previous to this publick examination, not only said, but attested under his hand, that he had seen the ship-master in the year subsequent to that in which the court was finally satisfied he was drowned. When interrogated with the strictness of judicial inquiry, and under the awe of an oath, he recollected himself better, and retracted what he had formerly asserted, apologising for his inaccuracy, by telling the judges, &lsquo;A man will <span class="t8">say</span> what he will not <span class="t8">swear</span>.&rsquo; By many he was much censured, and it was maintained that every gentleman would be as attentive to truth without the sanction of an oath, as with it. Dr. Johnson, though he himself was distinguished at all times by a scrupulous adherence to truth, controverted this proposition; and as a proof that this was not, though it ought to be, the case, urged the very different decisions of elections under Mr. Grenville&rsquo;s Act, from those formerly made. &lsquo;Gentlemen will not pronounce upon oath what they would have said, and voted in the house, without that sanction.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">However difficult it may be for men who believe in preternatural communications, in modern times, to satisfy those who are of a different opinion, they may easily refute the doctrine of their opponents, who impute a belief in <span class="t8">second sight</span> to <span class="t8">superstition</span>. To entertain a visionary notion that one sees a distant or future event, may be called <span class="t8">superstition</span>: but the correspondence of the fact or event with such an impression on the fancy, though certainly very wonderful, <span class="t8">if proved</span>, has no more connection with superstition, than magnetism or electricity.</p>
<p class="p24">After dinner, various topicks were discussed; but I recollect only one particular. Dr. Johnson compared the different talents of Garrick and Foote, as companions, and gave Garrick greatly the preference for elegance, though he allowed Foote extraordinary powers of entertainment. He said, &lsquo;Garrick is restrained by some principle; but Foote has the advantage of an unlimited range. Garrick has some delicacy of feeling; it is possible to put him out; you may get the better of him; but Foote is the most incompressible fellow that I ever knew; when you have driven him into a corner, and think you are sure of him, he runs through between your legs, or jumps over your head, and makes his escape.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Dr. Erskine and Mr. Robert Walker, two very respectable ministers of Edinburgh, supped with us, as did the Reverend Dr. Webster. The conversation turned on the Moravian missions, and on the Methodists. Dr. Johnson observed in general, that missionaries were too sanguine in their accounts of their success among savages, and that much of what they tell is not to be believed. He owned that the Methodists had done good; had spread religious impressions among the vulgar part of mankind: but, he said, they had great bitterness against other Christians, and that he never could get a Methodist to explain in what he excelled others; that it always ended in the indispensible necessity of hearing one of their preachers.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 11.</span></p>
<p class="p21">Principal Robertson came to us as we sat at breakfast, he advanced to Dr. Johnson, repeating a line of Virgil, which I forget. I suppose, either </p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Post varios casus, per tot discrimina rerum &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">or </p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash; multum ille et terris jactatus, et alto.</p>
<p class="p24">Every body had accosted us with some studied compliment on our return. Dr. Johnson said, &lsquo;I am really ashamed of the congratulations which we receive. We are addressed as if we had made a voyage to Nova Zembla, and suffered five persecutions in Japan.&rsquo; And he afterwards remarked, that, &lsquo;to see a man come up with a formal air and a Latin line, when we had no fatigue and no danger, was provoking.&rsquo; I told him, he was not sensible of the danger, having lain under cover in the boat during the storm: he was like the chicken, that hides its head under its wing, and then thinks itself safe.</p>
<p class="p24">Lord Elibank came to us, as did Sir William Forbes. The rash attempt in 1745 being mentioned, I observed, that it would make a fine piece of History. Dr. Johnson said it would. Lord Elibank doubted whether any man of this age could give it impartially. JOHNSON. &lsquo;A man, by talking with those of different sides, who were actors in it, and putting down all that he hears, may in time collect the materials of a good narrative. You are to consider, all history was at first oral. I suppose Voltaire was fifty years in collecting his <span class="t8">Louis XIV</span>. which he did in the way that I am proposing.&rsquo; ROBERTSON. &lsquo;He did so. He lived much with all the great people who were concerned in that reign, and heard them talk of everything: and then either took Mr. Boswell&rsquo;s way, of writing down what he heard, or, which is as good, preserved it in his memory; for he has a wonderful memory.&rsquo; With the leave, however, of this elegant historian, no man&rsquo;s memory can preserve facts or sayings with such fidelity as may be done by writing them down when they are recent. Dr. Robertson said, &lsquo;it was now full time to make such a collection as Dr. Johnson suggested; for many of the people who were then in arms, were dropping off; and both Whigs and Jacobites were now come to talk with moderation.&rsquo; Lord Elibank said to him, &lsquo;Mr. Robertson, the first thing that gave me a high opinion of you, was your saying in the <span class="t8">Select Society</span>, while parties ran high, soon after the year 1745, that you did not think worse of a man&rsquo;s moral character for his having been in rebellion. This was venturing to utter a liberal sentiment, while both sides had a detestation of each other.&rsquo; Dr. Johnson observed, that being in rebellion from a notion of another&rsquo;s right, was not connected with depravity; and that we had this proof of it, that all mankind applauded the pardoning of rebels; which they would not do in the case of robbers and murderers. He said, with a smile, that &lsquo;he wondered that the phrase of <span class="t8">unnatural</span> rebellion should be so much used, for that all rebellion was natural to man.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p20">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p24">As I kept no Journal of anything that passed after this morning, I shall, from memory, group together this and the other days, till that on which Dr. Johnson departed for London. They were in all nine days; on which he dined at Lady Colvill&rsquo;s, Lord Hailes&rsquo;s, Sir Adolphus Oughton&rsquo;s, Sir Alexander Dick&rsquo;s, Principal Robertson&rsquo;s, Mr. M&rsquo;Laurin&rsquo;s, and thrice at Lord Elibank&rsquo;s seat in the country, where we also passed two nights. He supped at the Honourable Alexander Gordon&rsquo;s, now one of our judges, by the title of Lord Rockville; at Mr. Nairne&rsquo;s, now also one of our judges, by the title of Lord Dunsinan; at Dr. Blair&rsquo;s, and Mr. Tytler&rsquo;s; and at my house thrice, one evening with a numerous company, chiefly gentlemen of the law; another with Mr. Menzies of Culdares, and Lord Monboddo, who disengaged himself on purpose to meet him; and the evening on which we returned from Lord Elibank&rsquo;s, he supped with my wife and me by ourselves.</p>
<p class="p24">He breakfasted at Dr. Webster&rsquo;s, at old Mr. Drummond&rsquo;s, and at Dr. Blacklock&rsquo;s; and spent one forenoon at my uncle Dr. Boswell&rsquo;s, who shewed him his curious museum; and, as he was an elegant scholar, and a physician bred in the school of Boerhaave, Dr. Johnson was pleased with his company. On the mornings when he breakfasted at my house, he had, from ten o&rsquo;clock till one or two, a constant levee of various persons, of very different characters and descriptions. I could not attend him, being obliged to be in the Court of Session; but my wife was so good as to devote the greater part of the morning to the endless task of pouring out tea for my friend and his visitors.</p>
<p class="p24">Such was the disposition of his time at Edinburgh. He said one evening to me, in a fit of languor, &lsquo;Sir, we have been harassed by invitations.&rsquo; I acquiesced. &lsquo;Ay, Sir,&rsquo; he replied; but how much worse would it have been, if we had been neglected?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">From what has been recorded in this <span class="t8">Journal</span>, it may well be supposed that a variety of admirable conversation has been lost, by my neglect to preserve it. I shall endeavour to recollect some of it, as well as I can.</p>
<p class="p24">At Lady Colvill&rsquo;s, to whom I am proud to introduce any stranger of eminence, that he may see what dignity and grace is to be found in Scotland, an officer observed, that he had heard Lord Mansfield was not a great English lawyer. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, supposing Lord Mansfield not to have the splendid talents which he possesses, he must be a great English lawyer, from having been so long at the bar, and having passed through so many of the great offices of the law. Sir, you may as well maintain that a carrier, who has driven a packhorse between Edinburgh and Berwick for thirty years, does not know the road, as that Lord Mansfield does not know the law of England.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">At Mr. Nairne&rsquo;s, he drew the character of Richardson, the authour of <span class="t8">Clarissa</span>, with a strong yet delicate pencil. I lament much that I have not preserved it; I only remember that he expressed a high opinion of his talents and virtues; but observed, that &lsquo;his perpetual study was to ward off petty inconveniences, and procure petty pleasures; that his love of continual superiority was such, that he took care to be always surrounded by women, who listened to him implicitly, and did not venture to controvert his opinions; and that his desire of distinction was so great, that he used to give large vails to the Speaker Onslow&rsquo;s servants, that they might treat him with respect.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On the same evening, he would not allow that the private life of a Judge, in England, was required to be so strictly decorous as I supposed. &lsquo;Why then, Sir, (said I,) according to your account, an English judge may just live like a gentleman.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Yes, Sir, &mdash; if he <span class="t8">can</span>.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">At Mr. Tytler&rsquo;s, I happened to tell that one evening, a great many years ago, when Dr. Hugh Blair and I were sitting together in the pit of Drury-lane play-house, in a wild freak of youthful extravagance, I entertained the audience <span class="t8">prodigiously</span>, by imitating the lowing of a cow. A little while after I had told this story, I differed from Dr. Johnson, I suppose too confidently, upon some point, which I now forget. He did not spare me. &lsquo;Nay, Sir, (said he,) if you cannot talk better as a man, I&rsquo;d have you bellow like a cow.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">At Dr. Webster&rsquo;s, he said, that he believed hardly any man died without affectation. This remark appears to me to be well founded, and will account for many of the celebrated death-bed sayings which are recorded.</p>
<p class="p24">On one of the evenings at my house, when he told that Lord Lovat boasted to an English nobleman, that though he had not his wealth, he had two thousand men whom he could at any time call into the field, the Honourable Alexander Gordon observed, that those two thousand men brought him to the block. &lsquo;True, Sir, (said Dr. Johnson:) but you may just as well argue, concerning a man who has fallen over a precipice to which he has walked too near,&mdash; &ldquo;His two legs brought him to that,&rdquo; is he not the better for having two legs?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">At Dr. Blair&rsquo;s I left him, in order to attend a consultation, during which he and his amiable host were by themselves. I returned to supper, at which were Principal Robertson, Mr. Nairne, and some other gentlemen. Dr. Robertson and Dr. Blair, I remember, talked well upon subordination and government; and, as my friend and I were walking home, he said to me, &lsquo;Sir, these two doctors are good men, and wise men.&rsquo; I begged of Dr. Blair to recollect what he could of the long conversation that passed between Dr. Johnson and him alone, this evening, and he obligingly wrote to me as follows: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;<span class="t8">March</span> 3, 1785.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo; &mdash; As so many years have intervened, since I chanced to have that conversation with Dr. Johnson in my house, to which you refer, I have forgotten most of what then passed, but remember that I was both instructed and entertained by it. Among other subjects, the discourse happening to turn on modern Latin poets, the Dr. expressed a very favourable opinion of Buchanan, and instantly repeated, from beginning to end, an ode of his, intituled <span class="t8">Calendae Maiae</span>, (the eleventh in his <span class="t8">Miscellaneorum Liber</span>), beginning with these words, &lsquo;<span class="t8">Salvete sacris deliciis sacrae</span>,&rsquo; with which I had formerly been unacquainted; but upon perusing it, the praise which he bestowed upon it, as one of the happiest of Buchanan&rsquo;s poetical compositions, appeared to me very just. He also repeated to me a Latin ode he had composed in one of the western islands, from which he had lately returned. We had much discourse concerning his excursion to those islands, with which he expressed himself as having been highly pleased; talked in a favourable manner of the hospitality of the inhabitants; and particularly spoke much of his happiness in having you for his companion; and said, that the longer he knew you, he loved and esteemed you the more. This conversation passed in the interval between tea and supper, when we were by ourselves. You, and the rest of the company who were with us at supper, have often taken notice that he was uncommonly bland and gay that evening, and gave much pleasure to all who were present. This is all that I can recollect distinctly of that long conversation.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your&rsquo;s sincerely,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;HUGH BLAIR.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">At Lord Hailes&rsquo;s, we spent a most agreeable day; but again I must lament that I was so indolent as to let almost all that passed evaporate into oblivion. Dr. Johnson observed there, that &lsquo;it is wonderful how ignorant many officers of the army are, considering how much leisure they have for study, and the acquisition of knowledge.&rsquo; I hope he was mistaken; for he maintained that many of them were ignorant of things belonging immediately to their own profession; &lsquo;for instance, many cannot tell how far a musket will carry a bullet;&rsquo; in proof of which, I suppose, he mentioned some particular person, for Lord Hailes, from whom I solicited what he could recollect of that day, writes to me as follows: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;As to Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s observation about the ignorance of officers, in the length that a musket will carry, my brother, Colonel Dalrymple, was present, and he thought that the doctor was either mistaken, by putting the question wrong, or that he had conversed on the subject with some person out of service.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Was it upon that occasion that he expressed no curiosity to see the room at Dumfermline, where Charles I. was born? &ldquo;I know that he was born, (said he;) no matter where.&rdquo; &mdash; Did he envy us the birth-place of the king?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Near the end of his <span class="t8">Journey</span>, Dr. Johnson has given liberal praise to Mr. Braidwood&rsquo;s academy for the deaf and dumb. When he visited it, a circumstance occurred which was truly characteristical of our great Lexicographer. &lsquo;Pray, (said he,) can they pronounce any <span class="t8">long</span> words?&rsquo; Mr. Braidwood informed him they could. Upon which Dr. Johnson wrote one of his <span class="t8">sesquipedalia verba</span>, which was pronounced by the scholars, and he was satisfied. My readers may perhaps wish to know what the word was; but I cannot gratify their curiosity. Mr. Braidwood told me, it remained long in his school, but had been lost before I made my inquiry.</p>
<p class="p24">Dr. Johnson one day visited the Court of Session. He thought the mode of pleading there too vehement, and too much addressed to the passions of the judges. &lsquo;This (said he) is not the Areopagus.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">At old Mr. Drummond&rsquo;s, Sir John Dalrymple quaintly said, the two noblest animals in the world were, a Scotch Highlander and an English sailor. &lsquo;Why, Sir, (said Dr. Johnson,) I shall say nothing as to the Scotch Highlander; but as to the English Sailor, I cannot agree with you.&rsquo; Sir John said, he was generous in giving away his money.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, he throws away his money, without thought, and without merit. I do not call a tree generous, that sheds its fruit at every breeze.&rsquo; Sir John having affected to complain of the attacks made upon his <span class="t8">Memoirs</span>, Dr. Johnson said, &lsquo;Nay, Sir, do not complain. It is advantageous to an authour, that his book should be attacked as well as praised. Fame is a shuttlecock. If it be struck only at one end of the room, it will soon fall to the ground. To keep it up, it must be struck at both ends.&rsquo; Often have I reflected on this since; and, instead of being angry at many of those who have written against me, have smiled to think that they were unintentionally subservient to my fame, by using a battledoor to make me <span class="t8">virum volitare per ora</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">At Sir Alexander Dick&rsquo;s, from that absence of mind to which every man is at times subject, I told, in a blundering manner, Lady Eglingtoune&rsquo;s complimentary adoption of Dr. Johnson as her son; for I unfortunately stated that her ladyship adopted him as her son, in consequence of her having been married the year <span class="t8">after</span> he was born. Dr. Johnson instantly corrected me. &lsquo;Sir, don&rsquo;t you perceive that you are defaming the countess? For, supposing me to be her son, and that she was not married till the year after my birth, I must have been her <span class="t8">natural</span> son.&rsquo; A young lady of quality, who was present, very handsomely said, &lsquo;Might not the son have justified the fault?&rsquo; My friend was much flattered by this compliment, which he never forgot. When in more than ordinary spirits, and talking of his journey in Scotland, he has called to me, &lsquo;Boswell, what was it that the young lady of quality said of me at Sir Alexander Dick&rsquo;s ?&rsquo; Nobody will doubt that I was happy in repeating it.</p>
<p class="p24">My illustrious friend, being now desirous to be again in the great theatre of life and animated exertion, took a place in the coach, which was to set out for London on Monday the 22nd of November. Sir John Dalrymple pressed him to come on the Saturday before, to his house at Cranston, which being twelve miles from Edinburgh, upon the middle road to Newcastle, (Dr. Johnson had come to Edinburgh by Berwick, and along the naked coast,) it would make his journey easier, as the coach would take him up at a more seasonable hour than that at which it sets out. Sir John, I perceived, was ambitious of having such a guest; but, as I was well assured, that at this very time he had joined with some of his prejudiced countrymen in railing at Dr. Johnson, and had said, he &lsquo;wondered how any gentleman of Scotland could keep company with him,&rsquo; I thought he did not deserve the honour: yet, as it might be a convenience to Dr. Johnson, I contrived that he should accept the invitation, and engaged to conduct him. I resolved that, on our way to Sir John&rsquo;s, we should make a little circuit by Roslin Castle, and Hawthornden, and wished to set out soon after breakfast; but young Mr. Tytler came to shew Dr. Johnson some essays which he had written; and my great friend, who was exceedingly obliging when thus consulted, was detained so long, that it was, I believe, one o&rsquo;clock before we got into our post-chaise. I found that we should be too late for dinner at Sir John Dalrymple&rsquo;s, to which we were engaged: but I would by no means lose the pleasure of seeing my friend at Hawthornden, &mdash; of seeing <span class="t8">Sam Johnson</span> at the very spot where <span class="t8">Ben Jonson</span> visited the learned and poetical Drummond.</p>
<p class="p24">We surveyed Roslin Castle, the romantick scene around it, and the beautiful Gothick chapel, and dined and drank tea at the inn; after which we proceeded to Hawthornden, and viewed the caves; and I all the while had <span class="t8">Rare Ben</span> in my mind, and was pleased to think that this place was now visited by another celebrated wit of England.</p>
<p class="p24">By this time &lsquo;the waning night was growing old,&rsquo; and we were yet several miles from Sir John Dalrymple&rsquo;s. Dr. Johnson did not seem much troubled at our having treated the baronet with so little attention to politeness; but when I talked of the grievous disappointment it must have been to him that we did not come to the <span class="t8">feast</span> that he had prepared for us, (for he told us he had killed a seven-year old sheep on purpose,) my friend got into a merry mood, and jocularly said, &lsquo;I dare say, Sir, he has been very sadly distressed: Nay, we do not know but the consequence may have been fatal. Let me try to describe his situation in his own historical style, I have as good a right to make him think and talk, as he has to tell us how people thought and talked a hundred years ago, of which he has no evidence. All history, so far as it is not supported by contemporary evidence, is romance &mdash; Stay now. &mdash; Let us consider!&rsquo; He then (heartily laughing all the while) proceeded in his imitation, I am sure to the following effect, though now, at the distance of almost twelve years, I cannot pretend to recollect all the precise words: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Dinner being ready, he wondered that his guests were not yet come. His wonder was soon succeeded by impatience. He walked about the room in anxious agitation; sometimes he looked at his watch, sometimes he looked out at the window with an eager gaze of expectation, and revolved in his mind the various accidents of human life. His family beheld him with mute concern. &ldquo;Surely (said he, with a sigh,) they will not fail me.&rdquo; The mind of man can bear a certain pressure; but there is a point when it can bear no more. A rope was in his view, and he died a Roman death.</p>
<p class="p24">It was very late before we reached the seat of Sir John Dalrymple, who, certainly with some reason, was not in very good humour. Our conversation was not brilliant. We supped, and went to bed in ancient rooms, which would have better suited the climate of Italy in summer, than that of Scotland in the month of November.</p>
<p class="p24">I recollect no conversation of the next day, worth preserving, except one saying of Dr. Johnson, which will be a valuable text for many decent old dowagers, and other good company, in various circles to descant upon. He said, &lsquo;I am sorry I have not learnt to play at cards. It is very useful in life: it generates kindness, and consolidates society.&rsquo; He certainly could not mean deep play.</p>
<p class="p24">My friend and I thought we should be more comfortable at the inn at Blackshields, two miles farther on. We therefore went thither in the evening, and he was very entertaining; but I have preserved nothing but the pleasing remembrance, and his verses on George the Second and Cibber, and his epitaph on Parnell, which he was then so good as to dictate to me. We breakfasted together next morning, and then the coach came, and took him up. He had, as one of his companions in it, as far as Newcastle, the worthy and ingenious Dr. Hope, botanical professor at Edinburgh. Both Dr. Johnson and he used to speak of their good fortune in thus accidentally meeting; for they had much instructive conversation, which is always a most valuable enjoyment, and, when found where it is not expected, is peculiarly relished.</p>
<p class="p24">I have now completed my account of our Tour to the Hebrides. I have brought Dr. Johnson down to Scotland, and seen him into the coach which in a few hours carried him back into England. He said to me often, that the time he spent in this Tour was the pleasantest part of his life, and asked me if I would lose the recollection of it for five hundred pounds. I answered I would not; and he applauded my setting such a value on an accession of new images in my mind.</p>
<p class="p24">Had it not been for me, I am persuaded Dr. Johnson never would have undertaken such a journey; and I must be allowed to assume some merit from having been the cause that our language has been enriched with such a book as that which he published on his return; a book which I never read but with the utmost admiration, as I had such opportunities of knowing from what very meagre materials it was composed.</p>
<p class="p24">But my praise may be supposed partial; and therefore I shall insert two testimonies, not liable to that objection, both written by gentlemen of Scotland, to whose opinions I am confident the highest respect will be paid, Lord Hailes, and Mr. Dempster. &lsquo;TO JAMES</p>
<p class="p24">BOSWELL, ESQ.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I have received much pleasure and much instruction, from perusing <span class="t8">The Journey to the Hebrides</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I admire the elegance and variety of description, and the lively picture of men and manners. I always approve of the moral, often of the political, reflections. I love the benevolence of the authour.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;They who search for faults, may possibly find them in this, as well as in every other work of literature.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;For example, the friends of the old family say that <span class="t8">the aera of planting</span> is placed too late, at the Union of the two kingdoms. I am known to be no friend of the old family; yet I would place the aera of planting at the Restoration; after the murder of Charles I. had been expiated in the anarchy which succeeded it.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Before the Restoration, few trees were planted, unless by the monastick drones: their successors, (and worthy patriots they were,) the barons, first cut down the trees, and then sold the estates. The gentleman at St. Andrews, who said that there were but two trees in Fife, ought to have added, that the elms of Balmerino were sold within these twenty years, to make pumps for the fire-engines.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;In J. Major de <span class="t8">Gestis Scotorum</span>, L. i. C. 2. last edition, there is a singular passage: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;&ldquo;Davidi Cranstoneo conterraneo, dum de prima theologiae licentia foret, duo ei consocii et familiares, et mei cum eo in artibus auditores, scilicet Jacobus Almain Senonensis, et Petrus Bruxcellensis, Praedicatoris ordinis, in Sorbonae curia die Sorbonico commilitonibus suis publice objecerunt, <span class="t8">quod pane avenaceo plebeii Scoti</span>, sicut a quodam religioso intellexerant, <span class="t8">vescebantur, ut virum, quem cholericum noverant, honestis salibus tentarent, qui hoc inficiari tanquam patriae dedecus nisus est</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Pray introduce our countryman, Mr. Licentiate David Cranston, to the acquaintance of Mr. Johnson.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The syllogism seems to have been this: </p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;They who feed on oatmeal are barbarians;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Scots feed on oatmeal:</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ergo &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">The licentiate denied the <span class="t8">minor</span>, </p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am, Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your most obedient servant,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;DAV. DALRYMPLE.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Newhailes, 6th Feb. 1775.&rsquo; </p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To JAMES BOSWELL, ESQ., EDINBURGH.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dunnichen, 16th February, 1775.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;MY DEAR BOSWELL,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I cannot omit a moment to return you my best thanks for the entertainment you have furnished me, my family, and guests, by the perusal of Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Journey to the Western Islands</span>; and now for my sentiments of it. I was well entertained. His descriptions are accurate and vivid. He carried me on the Tour along with him. I am pleased with the justice he has done to your humour and vivacity. &ldquo;The noise of the wind being all its own,&rdquo; is a <span class="t8">bon-mot</span>, that it would have been a pity to have omitted, and a robbery not to have ascribed to its author.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;There is nothing in the book, from beginning to end, that a Scotchman need to take amiss. What he says of the country is true, and his observations on the people are what must naturally occur to a sensible, observing, and reflecting inhabitant of a <span class="t8">convenient</span> Metropolis, where a man on thirty pounds a year may be better accommodated with all the little wants of life, than <span class="t8">Col.</span> or <span class="t8">Sir Allan</span>. He reasons candidly about the <span class="t8">second sight</span>; but I wish he had enquired more, before he ventured to say he even doubted of the possibility of such an unusual and useless deviation from all the known laws of nature. The notion of the second sight I consider as a remnant of superstitious ignorance and credulity, which a philosopher will set down as such, till the contrary is clearly proved, and then it will be classed among the other certain, though unaccountable parts of our nature, like dreams, and-I do not know what. &lsquo;In regard to the language, it has the merit of being all his own. Many words of foreign extraction are used, where, I believe, common ones would do as well, especially on familiar occasions. Yet I believe he could not express himself so forcibly in any other stile. I am charmed with his researches concerning the Erse language, and the antiquity of their manuscripts. I am quite convinced; and I shall rank <span class="t8">Ossian</span>, and his <span class="t8">Fingals</span> and <span class="t8">Oscars</span>, amongst the Nursery Tales, not the true history of our country, in all time to come.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Upon the whole, the book cannot displease, for it has no pretensions. The author neither says he is a Geographer, nor an Antiquarian, nor very learned in the History of Scotland, nor a Naturalist, nor a Fossilist. The manners of the people, and the face of the country, are all he attempts to describe, or seems to have thought of. Much were it to be wished, that they who have travelled into more remote, and of course, more curious, regions, had all possessed his good sense. Of the state of learning, his observations on Glasgow University shew he has formed a very sound judgement. He understands our climate too, and he has accurately observed the changes, however slow and imperceptible to us, which Scotland has undergone, in consequence of the blessings of liberty and internal peace. I could have drawn my pen through the story of the old woman at St. Andrews, being the only silly thing in the book. He has taken the opportunity of ingrafting into the work several good observations, which I dare say he had made upon men and things, before he set foot on Scotch ground, by which it is considerably enriched. A long journey, like a tall May-pole, though not very beautiful itself, yet is pretty enough, when ornamented with flowers and garlands; it furnishes a sort of cloak-pins for hanging the furniture of your mind upon; and whoever sets out upon a journey, without furnishing his mind previously with much study and useful knowledge, erects a May-pole in December, and puts up very useless cloak-pins.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I hope the book will induce many of his countrymen to make the same jaunt, and help to intermix the more liberal part of them still more with us, and perhaps abate somewhat of that virulent antipathy which many of them entertain against the Scotch: who certainly would never have formed those <span class="t8">combinations</span> which he takes notice of, more than their ancestors, had they not been necessary for their mutual safety, at least for their success, in a country where they are treated as foreigners. They would find us not deficient, at least in point of hospitality, and they would be ashamed ever after to abuse us in the mass.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;So much for the Tour. I have now, for the first time in my life, passed a winter in the country; and never did three months roll on with more swiftness and satisfaction. I used not only to wonder at, but pity, those whose lot condemned them to winter any where but in either of the capitals. But every place has its charms to a cheerful mind. I am busy planting and taking measures for opening the summer campaign in farming; and I find I have an excellent resource, when revolutions in politicks perhaps, and revolutions of the sun for certain, will make it decent for me to retreat behind the ranks of the more forward in life.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am glad to hear the last was a very busy week with you. I see you as counsel in some causes which must have opened a charming field for your humourous vein. As it is more uncommon, so I verily believe it is more useful than the more serious exercise of reason; and, to a man who is to appear in publick, more eclat is to be gained, sometimes more money too, by a <span class="t8">bon-mot</span>, than a learned speech. It is the fund of natural humour which Lord North possesses, that makes him so much the favourite of the house, and so able, because so amiable, a leader of a party.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I have now finished <span class="t8">my</span> Tour of <span class="t8">Seven Pages</span>. In what remains, I beg leave to offer my compliments, and those of <span class="t8">ma tres chere femme</span>, to you and Mrs. Boswell. Pray unbend the busy brow, and frolick a little in a letter to,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;My dear Boswell,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your affectionate friend,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;GEORGE DEMPSTER.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I shall also present the publick with a correspondence with the Laird of Rasay, concerning a passage in the <span class="t8">Journey to the</span> Western Islands, which shews Dr. Johnson in a very amiable light.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To JAMES BOSWELL, ESQ.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Rasay, April 10th, 1775.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I take this occasion of returning you my most hearty thanks for the civilities shewn to my daughter by you and Mrs. Boswell. Yet, though she has informed me that I am under this obligation, I should very probably have deferred troubling you with making my acknowledgments at present, if I had not seen Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Journey to the Western Isles</span>, in which he has been pleased to make a very friendly mention of my family, for which I am surely obliged to him, as being more than an equivalent for the reception you and he met with. Yet there is one paragraph I should have been glad he had omitted, which I am sure was owing to misinformation; that is, that I had acknowledged McLeod to be my chief, though my ancestors disputed the pre-eminence for a long tract of time.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I never had occasion to enter seriously on this argument with the present laird or his grandfather, nor could I have any temptation to such a renunciation from either of them. I acknowledge, the benefit of being chief of a clan is in our days of very little significancy, and to trace out the progress of this honour to the founder of a family, of any standing, would perhaps be a matter of some difficulty.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The true state of the present case is this: the McLeod family consists of two different branches; the M&rsquo;Leods of Lewis, of which I am descended, and the M&rsquo;Leods of Harris. And though the former have lost a very extensive estate by forfeiture in king James the Sixth&rsquo;s time, there are still several respectable families of it existing, who would justly blame me for such an unmeaning cession, when they all acknowledge me head of that family; which though in fact it be but an ideal point of honour, is not hitherto so far disregarded in our country, but it would determine some of my friends to look on me as a much smaller man than either they or myself judge me at present to be. I will, therefore, ask it as a favour of you to acquaint the Doctor with the difficulty he has brought me to. In travelling among rival clans, such a silly tale as this might easily be whispered into the ear of a passing stranger; but as it has no foundation in fact, I hope the Doctor will be so good as to take his own way in undeceiving the publick, I principally mean my friends and connections, who will be first angry at me, and next sorry to find such an instance of my littleness recorded in a book which has a very fair chance of being much read. I expect you will let me know what he will write you in return, and we here beg to make offer to you and Mrs. Boswell of our most respectful compliments.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Dear Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your most obedient humble servant,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;JOHN M&rsquo;LEOD.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p20">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;TO THE LAIRD OF RASAY.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;London, May 8, 1775.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The day before yesterday I had the honour to receive your letter, and I immediately communicated it to Dr. Johnson. He said he loved your spirit, and was exceedingly sorry that he had been the cause of the smallest uneasiness to you. There is not a more candid man in the world than he is, when properly addressed, as you will see from his letter to you, which I now enclose. He has allowed me to take a copy of it, and he says you may read it to your clan, or publish it if you please. Be assured, Sir, that I shall take care of what he has entrusted to me, which is to have an acknowledgement of his errour inserted in the Edinburgh newspapers. You will, I dare say, be fully satisfied with Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s behaviour. He is desirous to know that you are; and therefore when you have read his acknowledgement in the papers, I beg you may write to me; and if you choose it, I am persuaded a letter from you to the Doctor also will be taken kind. I shall be at Edinburgh the week after next.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Any civilities which my wife and I had in our power to shew to your daughter, Miss M&rsquo;Leod, were due to her own merit, and were well repaid by her agreeable company. But I am sure I should be a very unworthy man if I did not wish to shew a grateful sense of the hospitable and genteel manner in which you were pleased to treat me. Be assured, my dear Sir, that I shall never forget your goodness, and the happy hours which I spent in Rasay.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;You and Dr. M&rsquo;Leod were both so obliging as to promise me an account in writing, of all the particulars which each of you remember, concerning the transactions of 1745-6. Pray do not forget this, and be as minute and full as you can; put down every thing; I have a great curiosity to know as much as I can, authentically.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I beg that you may present my best respects to Lady Rasay, my compliments to your young family, and to Dr. M&rsquo;Leod; and my hearty good wishes to Malcolm, with whom I hope again to shake hands cordially. I have the honour to be,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Dear Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your obliged and faithful humble servant,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;JAMES BOSWELL.&rsquo; ADVERTISEMENT, written by Dr. Johnson, and inserted by his desire in the Edinburgh newspapers: &mdash; Referred to in the foregoing letter.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">&lsquo;THE authour of the</span> Journey to the Western Islands, <span class="t8">having related that the M&rsquo;Leods of Rasay acknowledge the chieftainship or superiority of the M&rsquo;Leods of Sky, finds that he has been misinformed or mistaken. He means in a future edition to correct his errour, and wishes to be told of more, if more have been discovered.&rsquo;</span></p>
<p class="p24">Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s letter was as follows: &mdash; </p>
