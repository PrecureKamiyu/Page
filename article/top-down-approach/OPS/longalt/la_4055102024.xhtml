The interaction begins with Alice, who appears as a young woman in profile looking to the right. Her computer first connects to a server labeled "Tracker," and this connection is represented by a blue arrow pointing back and forth from the computer to the tracker. To the right of Alice and her computer is a cluster of other desktop computers-eight in total. Alice's computer has connected with three of these, represented by black arrows that point back and forth between the computers. Those three computers are similarly connected, each to two other computers. Those computers are connected to other computers, forming a web of connections between them.</p></div></section></body></html>
