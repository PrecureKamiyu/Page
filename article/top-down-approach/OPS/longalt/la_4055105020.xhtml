At the top left of the X is a blue server, which is associated with a blue oval labeled "Managing Server." At the top right of the X is a computer designated as a Managed Device, which is associated with a white oval labeled "Agent," and containing a blue data packet labeled "MIB data." At the bottom right of the X is a server designated as a Managed Device, which is associated with a white oval labeled "Agent," and containing a blue data packet labeled "MIB data." At the bottom left of the X is a router designated as a Managed Device, which is associated with a white oval labeled "Agent," and containing a blue data packet labeled "MIB data." The link-layer switch itself is designate as a Managed Device and is associated with a white oval labeled "Agent," and containing a blue data packet labeled "MIB data." And to the immediate right of the link-layer switch is a router designated as a Managed Device.</p><p id="P700101195200000000000000000ADED" data-uri="M05_KURO4140_07_SE_C05.xhtml#P700101195200000000000000000ADED">A series of blue arrows extend back and forth between the various elements of the network, and a key at the bottom of the figure explains that the blue arrows represent "SNMP protocol." The blue arrows point back and forth from every white oval to the blue oval, labeled "Managing server."</p></div></section></body></html>
