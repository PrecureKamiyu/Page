If you are interested in learning more, read Smotherman’s excellent summary [S08].</p><p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Interrupts are an ancient idea, existing on the earliest of machines. For example, the UNIVAC in the early 1950’s had some form of interrupt vec- toring, although it is unclear in exactly which year this feature was avail- able [S08]. Sadly, even in its infancy, we are beginning to lose the origins of computing history.</p><p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">There is also some debate as to which machine first introduced the idea of DMA. For example, Knuth and others point to the DYSEAC (a “mo- bile” machine, which at the time meant it could be hauled in a trailer), whereas others think the IBM SAGE may have been the first [S08]. Ei- ther way, by the mid 50’s, systems with I/O devices that communicated directly with memory and interrupted the CPU when finished existed.</p><p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">The history here is difficult to trace because the inventions are tied to real, and sometimes obscure, machines. For example, some think that the Lincoln Labs TX-2 machine was first with vectored interrupts [S08], but this is hardly clear.</p><p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Because the ideas are relatively obvious – no Einsteinian leap is re- quired to come up with the idea of letting the CPU do something else while a slow I/O is pending – perhaps our focus on “who first?” is mis- guided. What is certainly clear: as people built these early machines, it became obvious that I/O support was needed. Interrupts, DMA, and re- lated ideas are all direct outcomes of the nature of fast CPUs and slow devices; if you were there at the time, you might have had similar ideas.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part374.htm">&lt; 上一个</a><span> | </span><a href="../ostep.html">内容</a><span> | </span><a href="part376.htm">下一个 &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
