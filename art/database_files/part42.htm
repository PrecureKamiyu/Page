Beyond these major changes, we revised the material in each chapter, bringing the older material</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 119pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">up-to-date, adding discussions on recent developments in database technology, and im- proving descriptions of topics that students found diﬃcult to understand. We have also added new exercises and updated references.</p><p style="padding-left: 119pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">For instructors who previously used the sixth edition, we list the more signiﬁcant changes below:</p><p class="s40" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 139pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s39">• </span>Relational algebra has been moved into Chapter 2, to help students better under- stand relational operations that form the basis of query languages such as <span class="s41">SQL</span>. Deeper coverage of relational algebra also aids in understanding the algebraic op- erators needed for discussion later of query processing and optimization. The two variants of the relational calculus are now in an online chapter, since we believe they are now of value only to more theoretically oriented courses, and can be omit- ted by most database courses.</p><p class="s40" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 139pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s39">• </span>The <span class="s41">SQL </span>chapters now include more details of database-system speciﬁc <span class="s41">SQL </span>vari- ations, to aid students carrying out practical assignments. Connections between <span class="s41">SQL </span>and the multiset relational algebra are also covered in more detail. Chapter 4 now covers all the material concerning joins, whereas previously natural join was in the preceding chapter. Coverage of sequences used to generate unique key values, and coverage of row-level security have also been added to this chapter. Recent extensions to the <span class="s41">JDBC API </span>that are particularly useful are now covered in Chapter 5; coverage of <span class="s41">OLAP </span>has been moved from this chapter to Chapter 11.</p><p class="s40" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 139pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s39">• </span>Chapter 6 has been modiﬁed to cover <span class="s41">E-R </span>diagrams along with <span class="s41">E-R </span>concepts, in- stead of ﬁrst covering the concepts and then introducing <span class="s41">E-R </span>diagrams as was done in earlier editions. We believe this will help students better comprehend the <span class="s41">E-R </span>model.</p><p class="s39" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 123pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 15pt;text-align: justify;">• <span class="s40">Chapter 7 now has improved coverage of temporal data modeling, including</span></p><p class="s42" style="padding-left: 139pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">SQL:2011 <span class="s43">temporal database features.</span></p><p class="s40" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 139pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s39">• </span>Chapter 8 is a new chapter that covers complex data types, including semi- structured data, such as <span class="s41">XML</span>, <span class="s41">JSON</span>, <span class="s41">RDF</span>, and <span class="s41">SPARQL</span>, object-based data, textual data, and spatial data. Object-based databases, <span class="s41">XML</span>, and information retrieval on textual data were covered in detail in the sixth edition; these topics have been ab- breviated and covered in Chapter 8, while the original chapters from the sixth edition have now been made available online.</p><p class="s40" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 139pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s39">• </span>Chapter 9 has been signiﬁcantly updated to reﬂect modern application devel- opment tools and techniques, including extended coverage of JavaScript and JavaScript libraries for building dynamic web interfaces, application development in Python using the Django framework, coverage of web services, and disconnec- tion operations using <span class="s41">HTML</span>5. Object-relation mapping using Django has been added, as also discussion of techniques for developing high-performance applica- tions that can handle large transaction loads.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s39" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 107pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: justify;">• <span class="s40">Chapter 10 is a new chapter on Big Data, covering Big Data concepts and tools from a user perspective. Big Data storage systems, the MapReduce paradigm, Apache Hadoop and Apache Spark, and streaming and graph databases are cov- ered in this chapter. The goal is to enable readers to use Big Data systems, with only a summary coverage of what happens behind the scenes. Big Data internals are covered in detail in later chapters.</span></p><p class="s39" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 107pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: justify;">• <span class="s40">The chapter on storage and ﬁle structure has been split into two chapters. Chap- ter 12 which covers storage has been updated with new technology, including ex- panded coverage of ﬂash memory, column-oriented storage, and storage organiza- tion in main-memory databases. Chapter 13, which covers data storage structures has been expanded, and now covers details such as free-space maps, partitioning, and most importantly column-oriented storage.</span></p><p class="s40" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 107pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s39">• </span>Chapter 14 on indexing now covers write-optimized index structures including the <span class="s41">LSM </span>tree and its variants, and the buﬀer tree, which are seeing increasing usage. Spatial indices are now covered brieﬂy in this chapter. More detailed coverage of <span class="s41">LSM </span>trees and spatial indices is provided in Chapter 24, which covers advanced indexing techniques. Bitmap indices are now covered in brief in Chapter 14, while more detailed coverage has been moved to Chapter 24. Dynamic hashing tech- niques have been moved into Chapter 24, since they are of limited practical im- portance today.</p><p class="s39" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 107pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: justify;">• <span class="s40">Chapter 15 on query processing has signiﬁcantly expanded coverage of pipelining in query processing, new material on query processing in main-memory, including query compilation, as well as brief coverage of spatial joins. Chapter 16 on query optimization has more examples of equivalence rules for operators such as outer joins and aggregates, has updated material on statistics for cost estimation, an improved presentation of the join-order optimization algorithm. Techniques for decorrelating nested subqueries using semijoin and antijoin operations have also been added.</span></p><p class="s39" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 107pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: justify;">• <span class="s40">Chapter 18 on concurrency control has new material on concurrency control in main-memory. Chapter 19 on recovery now gives more importance to high avail- ability using remote backup systems.</span></p><p class="s39" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 107pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: justify;">• <span class="s40">Our coverage of parallel and distributed databases has been completely revamped. Because of the evolution of these two areas into a continuum from low-level paral- lelism to geographically distributed systems, we now present these topics together.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s50" style="padding-left: 122pt;text-indent: -8pt;line-height: 77%;text-align: justify;">° <span class="s51">Chapter 20 on database architectures has been signiﬁcantly updated from the earlier edition, including new material on practical interconnection networks</span></p><p style="padding-left: 122pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">like the tree-like (or fat-tree) architecture, and signiﬁcantly expanded and up- dated material on shared-memory architectures and cache coherency. There is an entirely new section on cloud-based services, covering virtual machines and containers, platform-as-a-service, software-as-a-service, and elasticity.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s50" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 153pt;text-indent: -8pt;line-height: 76%;text-align: left;">° <span class="s51">Chapter 21 covers parallel and distributed storage; while a few parts of this chapter were present in the sixth edition, such as partitioning techniques, ev-</span></p><p style="padding-left: 153pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">erything else in this chapter is new.</p><p class="s50" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 153pt;text-indent: -8pt;line-height: 77%;text-align: left;">° <span class="s51">Chapter 22 covers parallel and distributed query processing. Again only a few sections of this chapter, such as parallel algorithms for sorting, join, and a few</span></p><p style="padding-left: 153pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">other relational operations, were present in the sixth edition, almost everything else in this chapter is new.</p><p class="s51" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 153pt;text-indent: -8pt;line-height: 77%;text-align: left;"><span class="s50">° </span>Chapter 23 covers parallel and distributed transaction processing. A few parts of this chapter, such as the sections on <span class="s52">2PC</span>, persistent messaging, and concur-</p><p style="padding-left: 153pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">rency control in distributed databases, are new but almost everything else in this chapter is new.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 119pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">As in the sixth edition, we facilitate the following of our running example by listing the database schema and the sample relation instances for our university database to- gether in Appendix A as well as where they are used in the various regular chapters. In addition, we provide, on our web site <span class="s49">db-book.com</span>, <span class="s44">SQL </span>data-deﬁnition statements for the entire example, along with <span class="s44">SQL </span>statements to create our example relation instances. This encourages students to run example queries directly on a database system and to experiment with modifying those queries. All topics not listed above are updated from the sixth edition, though their overall organization is relatively unchanged.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part41.htm">&lt; 上一个</a><span> | </span><a href="../database.html">内容</a><span> | </span><a href="part43.htm">下一个 &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
