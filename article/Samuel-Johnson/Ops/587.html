<h2 class="h20"><a id="a1253"></a>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">THE PRINCE EXAMINES THE HAPPINESS OF HIGH STATIONS</span></p>
<p class="p21">Rasselas applauded the design, and appeared next day with a splendid retinue at the court of the Bassa. He was soon distinguished for his magnificence, and admitted, as a prince whose curiosity had brought him from distant countries, to an intimacy with the great officers, and frequent conversation with the Bassa himself.</p>
<p class="p24">He was at first inclined to believe, that the man must be pleased with his own condition whom all approached with reverence and heard with obedience, and who had the power to extend his edicts to a whole kingdom. &ldquo;There can be no pleasure,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;equal to that of feeling at once the joy of thousands all made happy by wise administration. Yet since by the law of subordination this sublime delight can be in one nation but the lot of one, it is surely reasonable to think that there is some satisfaction more popular and accessible, and that millions can hardly be subjected to the will of a single man, only to fill his particular breast with incommunicable content.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">These thoughts were often in his mind, and he found no solution of the difficulty. But as presents and civilities gained him more familiarity, he found that almost every man who stood high in employment hated all the rest, and was hated by them, and that their lives were a continual succession of plots and detections, stratagems and escapes, faction and treachery. Many of those who surrounded the Bassa were sent only to watch and report his conduct; every tongue was muttering censure, and every eye was searching for a fault.</p>
<p class="p24">At last the letters of revocation arrived, the Bassa was carried in chains to Constantinople, and his name was mentioned no more.</p>
<p class="p24">&ldquo;What are we now to think of the prerogatives of power?&rdquo; said Rasselas to his sister; &ldquo;is it without any efficacy to good? or, is the subordinate degree only dangerous, and the supreme safe and glorious? Is the Sultan the only happy man in his dominions? or, is the Sultan himself subject to the torments of suspicion and the dread of enemies?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">In a short time the second Bassa was deposed; the Sultan that had advanced him was murdered by the Janizaries, and his successor had other views and different favourites.</p>
