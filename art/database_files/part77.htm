The user of the database system may query these tables, insert new tuples, delete tuples, and up- date (modify) tuples. There are several languages for expressing these operations.</span></p><p class="s39" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 107pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: justify;">• <span class="s40">The schema of a relation refers to its logical design, while an instance of the re- lation refers to its contents at a point in time. The schema of a database and an instance of a database are similarly deﬁned. The schema of a relation includes its attributes, and optionally the types of the attributes and constraints on the relation such as primary and foreign-key constraints.</span></p><p class="s39" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 107pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: justify;">• <span class="s40">A superkey of a relation is a set of one or more attributes whose values are guar- anteed to identify tuples in the relation uniquely. A candidate key is a minimal superkey, that is, a set of attributes that forms a superkey, but none of whose sub- sets is a superkey. One of the candidate keys of a relation is chosen as its primary key.</span></p><p class="s13" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 107pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s39">• </span><span class="s40">A foreign-key constraint from attribute(s) </span>A <span class="p">of relation </span>r<span class="s98">1</span><span class="p"> to the primary-key </span>B <span class="p">of relation </span>r<span class="s98">2</span><span class="p"> states that the value of </span>A <span class="p">for each tuple in </span>r<span class="s98">1</span><span class="p"> must also be the value of </span>B <span class="p">for some tuple in </span>r<span class="s98">2</span><span class="p">.

Practical query languages such as <span class="s41">SQL </span>are based on the relational algebra, but they add a number of useful syntactic features.</p><p class="s40" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 139pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s39">• </span>The relational algebra deﬁnes a set of algebraic operations that operate on tables, and output tables as their results.
