Note that we have omitted a number of details to simplify our analysis. For example, when writing in a mirrored system, the average seek time is a little higher than when writing to just a single disk, because the seek time is the max of two seeks (one on each disk). Thus, random write performance to two disks will generally be a little less than random write performance of a single disk. Also, when updating the parity disk in RAID-4/5, the first read of the old parity will likely cause a full seek and rotation, but the second write of the parity will only result in rotation.</p><p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">However, our comparison does capture the essential differences, and is useful for understanding tradeoffs across RAID levels. We present a summary in the table below; for the latency analysis, we simply use <span class="s43">D </span>to represent the time that a request to a single disk would take.</p><p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">To conclude, if you strictly want performance and do not care about reliability, striping is obviously best. If, however, you want random I/O performance and reliability, mirroring is the best; the cost you pay is in lost capacity. If capacity and reliability are your main goals, then RAID- 5 is the winner; the cost you pay is in small-write performance. Finally, if you are always doing sequential I/O and want to maximize capacity, RAID-5 also makes the most sense.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part409.htm">&lt; 上一个</a><span> | </span><a href="../ostep.html">内容</a><span> | </span><a href="part411.htm">下一个 &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
