<p class="p21">Being disappointed in my hopes of meeting Johnson this year, so that I could hear none of his admirable sayings, I shall compensate for this want by inserting a collection of them, for which I am indebted to my worthy friend Mr. Langton, whose kind communications have been separately interwoven in many parts of this work. Very few articles of this collection were committed to writing by himself, he not having that habit; which he regrets, and which those who know the numerous opportunities he had of gathering the rich fruits of <span class="t8">Johnsonian</span> wit and wisdom, must ever regret. I however found, in conversations with him, that a good store of <span class="t8">Johnsoniana</span> treasured in his mind; and I compared it to Herculaneum, or some old Roman field, which when dug, fully rewards the labour employed. The authenticity of every article is unquestionable. For the expression, I, who wrote them down in his presence, am partly answerable.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Theocritus is not deserving of very high respect as a writer; as to the pastoral part, Virgil is very evidently superiour. He wrote when there had been a larger influx of knowledge into the world than when Theocritus lived. Theocritus does not abound in description, though living in a beautiful country: the manners painted are coarse and gross. Virgil has much more description, more sentiment, more of Nature, and more of art. Some of the most excellent parts of Theocritus are, where Castor and Pollux, going with the other Argonauts, land on the Bebrycian coast, and there fall into a dispute with Amycus, the King of that country; which is as well conducted as Euripides could have done it; and the battle is well related. Afterwards they carry off a woman, whose two brothers come to recover her, and expostulate with Castor and Pollux on their injustice; but they pay no regard to the brothers, and a battle ensues, where Castor and his brother are triumphant. Theocritus seems not to have seen that the brothers have the advantage in their argument over his Argonaut heroes. <span class="t8">The Sicilian Gossips</span> is a piece of merit.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Callimachus is a writer of little excellence. The chief thing to be learned from him is his account of Rites and Mythology; which, though desirable to be known for the sake of understanding other parts of ancient authours, is the least pleasing or valuable part of their writings.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Mattaire&rsquo;s account of the Stephani is a heavy book. He seems to have been a puzzle-headed man, with a large share of scholarship, but with little geometry or logick in his head, without method, and possessed of little genius. He wrote Latin verses from time to time, and published a set in his old age, which he called &lsquo;<span class="t8">Senilia</span>;&rsquo; in which he shews so little learning or taste in writing, as to make <span class="t8">Carteret</span> a dactyl. In matters of genealogy it is necessary to give the bare names as they are; but in poetry, and in prose of any elegance in the writing, they require to have inflection given to them. His book of the Dialects is a sad heap of confusion; the only way to write on them is to tabulate them with Notes, added at the bottom of the page, and references.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;It may be questioned, whether there is not some mistake as to the methods of employing the poor, seemingly on a supposition that there is a certain portion of work left undone for want of persons to do it; but if that is otherwise, and all the materials we have are actually worked up, or all the manufactures we can use or dispose of are already executed, then what is given to the poor, who are to be set at work, must be taken from some who now have it; as time must be taken for learning, according to Sir William Petty&rsquo;s observation, a certain part of those very materials that, as it is, are properly worked up, must be spoiled by the unskilfulness of novices. We may apply to well-meaning, but misjudging persons in particulars of this nature, what Giannone said to a monk, who wanted what he called to <span class="t8">convert</span> him: <span class="t8">&ldquo;Tu sei santo, ma tu non sei filosofo&rdquo;</span> &mdash; It is an unhappy circumstance that one might give away five hundred pounds in a year to those that importune in the streets, and not do any good.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;There is nothing more likely to betray a man into absurdity than <span class="t8">condescension</span>; when he seems to suppose his understanding too powerful for his company.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Having asked Mr. Langton if his father and mother had sat for their pictures, which he thought it right for each generation of a family to do, and being told they had opposed it, he said, &ldquo;Sir, among the anfractuosities of the human mind, I know not if it may not be one, that there is a superstitious reluctance to sit for a picture.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;John Gilbert Cooper related, that soon after the publication of his <span class="t8">Dictionary</span>, Garrick being asked by Johnson what people said of it, told him, that among other animadversions, it was objected that he cited authorities which were beneath the dignity of such a work, and mentioned Richardson. &ldquo;Nay, (said Johnson,) I have done worse than that: I have cited <span class="t8">thee</span>, David.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Talking of expence, he observed, with what munificence a great merchant will spend his money, both from his having it at command, and from his enlarged views by calculation of a good effect upon the whole. &ldquo;Whereas (said he) you will hardly ever find a country gentleman who is not a good deal disconcerted at an unexpected occasion for his being obliged to lay out ten pounds.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;When in good humour he would talk of his own writings with a wonderful frankness and candour, and would even criticise them with the closest severity. One day, having read over one of his Ramblers, Mr. Langton asked him, how he liked that paper; he shook his head, and answered, &ldquo;too wordy.&rdquo; At another time, when one was reading his tragedy of <span class="t8">Irene</span> to a company at a house in the country, he left the room; and somebody having asked him the reason of this, he replied, Sir, I thought it had been better.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Talking of a point of delicate scrupulosity of moral conduct, he said to Mr. Langton, &ldquo;Men of harder minds than ours will do many things from which you and I would shrink; yet, Sir, they will perhaps do more good in life than we. But let us try to help one another. If there be a wrong twist it may be set right. It is not probable that two people can be wrong the same way.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Of the Preface to Capel&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Shakspeare</span>, he said, &ldquo;If the man would have come to me, I would have endeavoured to endow his purposes with words; for as it is, he doth gabble monstrously.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;He related, that he had once in a dream a contest of wit with some other person, and that he was very much mortified by imagining that his opponent had the better of him. &ldquo;Now, (said he,) one may mark here the effect of sleep in weakening the power of reflection; for had not my judgement failed me, I should have seen, that the wit of this supposed antagonist, by whose superiority I felt myself depressed, was as much furnished by me, as that which I thought I had been uttering in my own character.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;One evening in company, an ingenious and learned gentleman read to him a letter of compliment which he had received from one of the Professors of a foreign University. Johnson, in an irritable fit, thinking there was too much ostentation, said, &ldquo;I never receive any of these tributes of applause from abroad. One instance I recollect of a foreign publication, in which mention is made of <span class="t8">l&rsquo;illustre Lockman</span>.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Of Sir Joshua Reynolds, he said, &ldquo;Sir, I know no man who has passed through life with more observation than Reynolds.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;He repeated to Mr. Langton, with great energy, in the Greek, our SAVIOUR&rsquo;S gracious expression concerning the forgiveness of Mary Magdalen, &ldquo;[Greek: Ae pistis sou sesoke se poreuou eis eiraeuaeu.] Thy faith hath saved thee; go in peace.&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;the manner of this dismission is exceedingly affecting.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;He thus defined the difference between physical and moral truth; &ldquo;Physical truth, is, when you tell a thing as it actually is. Moral truth, is, when you tell a thing sincerely and precisely as it appears to you. I say such a one walked across the street; if he really did so, I told a physical truth. If I thought so, though I should have been mistaken, I told a moral truth.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Huggins, the translator of Ariosto, and Mr. Thomas Warton, in the early part of his literary life, had a dispute concerning that poet, of whom Mr. Warton in his <span class="t8">Observations on Spenser&rsquo;s Fairy Queen</span>, gave some account, which Huggins attempted to answer with violence, and said, &ldquo;I will <span class="t8">militate</span> no longer against his <span class="t8">nescience</span>.&rdquo; Huggins was master of the subject, but wanted expression. Mr. Warton&rsquo;s knowledge of it was then imperfect, but his manner lively and elegant. Johnson said, &ldquo;It appears to me, that Huggins has ball without powder, and Warton powder without ball.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Talking of the Farce of <span class="t8">High Life below Stairs</span>, he said, &ldquo;Here is a Farce, which is really very diverting when you see it acted; and yet one may read it, and not know that one has been reading any thing at all.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;He used at one time to go occasionally to the green room of Drury-lane Theatre, where he was much regarded by the players, and was very easy and facetious with them. He had a very high opinion of Mrs. Clive&rsquo;s comick powers, and conversed more with her than with any of them. He said, &ldquo;Clive, Sir, is a good thing to sit by; she always understands what you say.&rdquo; And she said of him, &ldquo;I love to sit by Dr. Johnson; he always entertains me.&rdquo; One night, when <span class="t8">The Recruiting Officer</span> was acted, he said to Mr. Holland, who had been expressing an apprehension that Dr. Johnson would disdain the works of Farquhar; &ldquo;No, Sir, I think Farquhar a man whose writings have considerable merit.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;His friend Garrick was so busy in conducting the drama, that they could not have so much intercourse as Mr. Garrick used to profess an anxious wish that there should be. There might, indeed, be something in the contemptuous severity as to the merit of acting, which his old preceptor nourished in himself, that would mortify Garrick after the great applause which he received from the audience. For though Johnson said of him, &ldquo;Sir, a man who has a nation to admire him every night, may well be expected to be somewhat elated;&rdquo; yet he would treat theatrical matters with a ludicrous slight. He mentioned one evening, &ldquo;I met David coming off the stage, drest in a woman&rsquo;s riding-hood, when he acted in <span class="t8">The Wonder</span>; I came full upon him, and I believe he was not pleased.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Once he asked Tom Davies, whom he saw drest in a fine suit of clothes, &ldquo;And what art thou to-night?&rdquo; Tom answered, &ldquo;The Thane of Ross;&rdquo; (which it will be recollected is a very inconsiderable character.) &ldquo;O brave!&rdquo; said Johnson.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Of Mr. Longley, at Rochester, a gentleman of very considerable learning, whom Dr. Johnson met there, he said, &ldquo;My heart warms towards him. I was surprised to find in him such a nice acquaintance with the metre in the learned languages; though I was somewhat mortified that I had it not so much to myself, as I should have thought.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Talking of the minuteness with which people will record the sayings of eminent persons, a story was told, that when Pope was on a visit to Spence at Oxford, as they looked from the window they saw a Gentleman Commoner, who was just come in from riding, amusing himself with whipping at a post. Pope took occasion to say, &ldquo;That young gentleman seems to have little to do.&rdquo; Mr. Beauclerk observed, &ldquo;Then, to be sure, Spence turned round and wrote that down;&rdquo; and went on to say to Dr. Johnson, &ldquo;Pope, Sir, would have said the same of you, if he had seen you distilling.&rdquo; JOHNSON. &ldquo;Sir, if Pope had told me of my distilling, I would have told him of his grotto.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;He would allow no settled indulgence of idleness upon principle, and always repelled every attempt to urge excuses for it, A friend one day suggested, that it was not wholesome to study soon after dinner. JOHNSON. &ldquo;Ah, Sir, don&rsquo;t give way to such a fancy. At one time of my life I had taken it into my head that it was not wholesome to study between breakfast and dinner.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Mr. Beauclerk one day repeated to Dr. Johnson Pope&rsquo;s lines,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Let modest Foster, if he will, excel</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ten metropolitans in preaching well:&rdquo; 32</p>
<p class="p24">Then asked the Doctor, &ldquo;Why did Pope say this?&rdquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, he hoped it would vex somebody.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Dr. Goldsmith, upon occasion of Mrs. Lennox&rsquo;s bringing out a play, said to Dr. Johnson at the CLUB, that a person had advised him to go and hiss it, because she had attacked Shakspeare in her book called <span class="t8">Shakspeare Illustrated</span>. JOHNSON. &ldquo;And did not you tell him he was a rascal?&rdquo; GOLDSMITH. &ldquo;No, Sir, I did not. Perhaps he might not mean what he said.&rdquo; JOHNSON. &ldquo;Nay, Sir, if he lied, it is a different thing.&rdquo; Colman slily said, (but it is believed Dr. Johnson did not hear him,) &ldquo;Then the proper expression should have been, &mdash; Sir, if you don&rsquo;t lie, you&rsquo;re a rascal.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;His affection for Topham Beauclerk was so great, that when Beauclerk was labouring under that severe illness which at last occasioned his death, Johnson said, (with a voice faultering with emotion,) &ldquo;Sir, I would walk to the extent of the diameter of the earth to save Beauclerk.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;One night at the CLUB he produced a translation of an Epitaph which Lord Elibank had written in English, for his Lady, and requested of Johnson to turn into Latin for him. Having read <span class="t8">Domina de North et Gray</span>, he said to Dyer, &ldquo;You see, Sir, what barbarisms we are compelled to make use of, when modern titles are to be specifically mentioned in Latin inscriptions.&rdquo; When he had read it once aloud, and there had been a general approbation expressed by the company, he addressed himself to Mr. Dyer in particular, and said, &ldquo;Sir, I beg to have your judgement, for I know your nicety.&rdquo; Dyer then very properly desired to read it over again; which having done, he pointed out an incongruity in one of the sentences. Johnson immediately assented to the observation, and said, &ldquo;Sir, this is owing to an alteration of a part of the sentence, from the form in which I had first written it; and I believe, Sir, you may have remarked, that the making a partial change, without a due regard to the general structure of the sentence, is a very frequent cause of errour in composition.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Johnson was well acquainted with Mr. Dossie, authour of a treatise on Agriculture; and said of him, &ldquo;Sir, of the objects which the Society of Arts have chiefly in view, the chymical effects of bodies operating upon other bodies, he knows more than almost any man.&rdquo; Johnson, in order to give Mr. Dossie his vote to be a member of this Society, paid up an arrear which had run on for two years. On this occasion he mentioned a circumstance as characteristick of the Scotch. One of that nation, (said he,) who had been a candidate, against whom I had voted, came up to me with a civil salutation. Now, Sir, this is their way. An Englishman would have stomached it, and been sulky, and never have taken further notice of you; but a Scotchman, Sir, though you vote nineteen times against him, will accost you with equal complaisance after each time, and the twentieth time, Sir, he will get your vote.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Talking on the subject of toleration, one day when some friends were with him in his study, he made his usual remark, that the State has a right to regulate the religion of the people, who are the children of the State. A clergyman having readily acquiesced in this, Johnson, who loved discussion, observed, &ldquo;But, Sir, you must go round to other States than our own. You do not know what a Bramin has to say for himself. In short, Sir, I have got no further than this: Every man has a right to utter what he thinks truth, and every other man has a right to knock him down for it. Martyrdom is the test.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;A man, he observed, should begin to write soon; for, if he waits till his judgement is matured, his inability, through want of practice to express his conceptions, will make the disproportion so great between what he sees, and what he can attain, that he will probably be discouraged from writing at all. As a proof of the justness of this remark, we may instance what is related of the great Lord Granville; that after he had written his letter, giving an account of the battle of Dettingen, he said, &ldquo;Here is a letter, expressed in terms not good enough for a tallow-chandler to have used.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Talking of a Court-martial that was sitting upon a very momentous publick occasion, he expressed much doubt of an enlightened decision; and said, that perhaps there was not a member of it, who in the whole course of his life, had ever spent an hour by himself in balancing probabilities.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Goldsmith one day brought to the CLUB a printed Ode, which he, with others, had been hearing read by its authour in a publick room at the rate of five shillings each for admission. One of the company having read it aloud, Dr. Johnson said, &ldquo;Bolder words and more timorous meaning, I think never were brought together.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Talking of Gray&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Odes</span>, he said, &ldquo;They are forced plants raised in a hot-bed; and they are poor plants; they are but cucumbers after all.&rdquo; A gentleman present, who had been running down Ode-writing in general, as a bad species of poetry, unluckily said, &ldquo;Had they been literally cucumbers, they had been better things than Odes.&rdquo;&mdash; &ldquo;Yes, Sir, (said Johnson,) for a <span class="t8">hog</span>.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;His distinction of the different degrees of attainment of learning was thus marked upon two occasions. Of Queen Elizabeth he said, &ldquo;She had learning enough to have given dignity to a bishop;&rdquo; and of Mr. Thomas Davies he said, &ldquo;Sir, Davies has learning enough to give credit to a clergyman.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;He used to quote, with great warmth, the saying of Aristotle recorded by Diogenes Laertius; that there was the same difference between one learned and unlearned, as between the living and the dead.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;It is very remarkable, that he retained in his memory very slight and trivial, as well as important things. As an instance of this, it seems that an inferiour domestick of the Duke of Leeds had attempted to celebrate his Grace&rsquo;s marriage in such homely rhimes as he could make; and this curious composition having been sung to Dr. Johnson he got it by heart, and used to repeat it in a very pleasant manner. Two of the stanzas were these: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;When the Duke of Leeds shall married be</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To a fine young lady of high quality,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How happy will that gentlewoman be</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his Grace of Leeds&rsquo;s good company.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She shall have all that&rsquo;s fine and fair,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the best of silk and sattin shall wear;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And ride in a coach to take the air,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And have a house in St. James&rsquo;s-square50.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">To hear a man, of the weight and dignity of Johnson, repeating such humble attempts at poetry, had a very amusing effect. He, however, seriously observed of the last stanza repeated by him, that it nearly comprized all the advantages that wealth can give.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;An eminent foreigner, when he was shewn the British Museum, was very troublesome with many absurd inquiries. &ldquo;Now there, Sir, (said he,) is the difference between an Englishman and a Frenchman. A Frenchman must be always talking, whether he knows any thing of the matter or not; an Englishman is content to say nothing, when he has nothing to say.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;His unjust contempt for foreigners was, indeed, extreme. One evening, at old Slaughter&rsquo;s coffee-house, when a number of them were talking loud about little matters, he said, &ldquo;Does not this confirm old Meynell&rsquo;s observation &mdash; <span class="t8">For any thing I see, foreigners are fools</span>.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;He said, that once, when he had a violent tooth-ach, a Frenchman accosted him thus: &mdash; <span class="t8">Ah, Monsieur vous etudiez trop</span>.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Having spent an evening at Mr. Langton&rsquo;s with the Reverend Dr. Parr, he was much pleased with the conversation of that learned gentleman; and after he was gone, said to Mr. Langton, &ldquo;Sir, I am obliged to you for having asked me this evening. Parr is a fair man. I do not know when I have had an occasion of such free controversy. It is remarkable how much of a man&rsquo;s life may pass without meeting with any instance of this kind of open discussion.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;We may fairly institute a criticism between Shakspeare and Corneille, as they both had, though in a different degree, the lights of a latter age. It is not so just between the Greek dramatick writers and Shakspeare. It may be replied to what is said by one of the remarkers on Shakspeare, that though Darius&rsquo;s shade had <span class="t8">prescience</span>, it does not necessarily follow that he had all <span class="t8">past</span> particulars revealed to him.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Spanish plays, being wildly and improbably farcical, would please children here, as children are entertained with stories full of prodigies; their experience not being sufficient to cause them to be so readily startled at deviations from the natural course of life. The machinery of the Pagans is uninteresting to us: when a Goddess appears in Homer or Virgil, we grow weary; still more so in the Grecian tragedies, as in that kind of composition a nearer approach to Nature is intended. Yet there are good reasons for reading romances; as &mdash; the fertility of invention, the beauty of style and expression, the curiosity of seeing with what kind of performances the age and country in which they were written was delighted: for it is to be apprehended, that at the time when very wild improbable tales were well received, the people were in a barbarous state, and so on the footing of children, as has been explained.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;It is evident enough that no one who writes now can use the Pagan deities and mythology; the only machinery, therefore, seems that of ministering spirits, the ghosts of the departed, witches, and fairies, though these latter, as the vulgar superstition concerning them (which, while in its force, infected at least the imagination of those that had more advantage in education, though their reason set them free from it,) is every day wearing out, seem likely to be of little further assistance in the machinery of poetry. As I recollect, Hammond introduces a hag or witch into one of his love elegies, where the effect is unmeaning and disgusting.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The man who uses his talent of ridicule in creating or grossly exaggerating the instances he gives, who imputes absurdities that did not happen, or when a man was a little ridiculous describes him as having been very much so, abuses his talents greatly. The great use of delineating absurdities is, that we may know how far human folly can go; the account, therefore, ought of absolute necessity to be faithful. A certain character (naming the person) as to the general cast of it, is well described by Garrick, but a great deal of the phraseology he uses in it, is quite his own, particularly in the proverbial comparisons, &ldquo;obstinate as a pig,&rdquo; &amp;c., but I don&rsquo;t know whether it might not be true of Lord &mdash;&mdash;&nbsp; &mdash; , that from a too great eagerness of praise and popularity, and a politeness carried to a ridiculous excess, he was likely, after asserting a thing in general, to give it up again in parts. For instance, if he had said Reynolds was the first of painters, he was capable enough of giving up, as objections might happen to be severally made, first his outline, &mdash; then the grace in form, &mdash; then the colouring, &mdash; and lastly, to have owned that he was such a mannerist, that the disposition of his pictures was all alike.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;For hospitality, as formerly practised, there is no longer the same reason; heretofore the poorer people were more numerous, and from want of commerce, their means of getting a livelihood more difficult; therefore the supporting them was an act of great benevolence; now that the poor can find maintenance for themselves, and their labour is wanted, a general undiscerning hospitality tends to ill, by withdrawing them from their work to idleness and drunkenness. Then, formerly rents were received in kind, so that there was a great abundance of provisions in possession of the owners of the lands, which, since the plenty of money afforded by commerce, is no longer the case.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Hospitality to strangers and foreigners in our country is now almost at an end, since, from the increase of them that come to us, there have been a sufficient number of people that have found an interest in providing inns and proper accommodations, which is in general a more expedient method for the entertainment of travellers. Where the travellers and strangers are few, more of that hospitality subsists, as it has not been worth while to provide places of accommodation. In Ireland there is still hospitality to strangers, in some degree; in Hungary and Poland probably more.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Colman, in a note on his translation of <span class="t8">Terence</span>, talking of Shakspeare&rsquo;s learning, asks, &ldquo;What says Farmer to this? What says Johnson?&rdquo; Upon this he observed, &ldquo;Sir, let Farmer answer for himself: <span class="t8">I</span> never engaged in this controversy. I always said, Shakspeare had Latin enough to grammaticise his English.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;A clergyman, whom he characterised as one who loved to say little oddities, was affecting one day, at a Bishop&rsquo;s table, a sort of slyness and freedom not in character, and repeated, as if part of <span class="t8">The Old Mans Wish</span>, a song by Dr. Walter Pope, a verse bordering on licentiousness. Johnson rebuked him in the finest manner, by first shewing him that he did not know the passage he was aiming at, and thus humbling him: &ldquo;Sir, that is not the song: it is thus.&rdquo; And he gave it right. Then looking stedfastly on him, &ldquo;Sir, there is a part of that song which I should wish to exemplify in my own life: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&ldquo;May I govern my passions with absolute sway!&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Being asked if Barnes knew a good deal of Greek, he answered, &ldquo;I doubt, Sir, he was <span class="t8">unoculus inter caecos</span>.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;He used frequently to observe, that men might be very eminent in a profession, without our perceiving any particular power of mind in them in conversation. &ldquo;It seems strange (said he) that a man should see so far to the right, who sees so short a way to the left. Burke is the only man whose common conversation corresponds with the general fame which he has in the world. Take up whatever topick you please, he is ready to meet you.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;A gentleman, by no means deficient in literature, having discovered less acquaintance with one of the Classicks than Johnson expected, when the gentleman left the room, he observed, &ldquo;You see, now, how little any body reads.&rdquo; Mr. Langton happening to mention his having read a good deal in Clenardus&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Greek Grammar</span>, &ldquo;Why, Sir, (said he,) who is there in this town who knows any thing of Clenardus but you and I?&rdquo; And upon Mr. Langton&rsquo;s mentioning that he had taken the pains to learn by heart the Epistle of St. Basil, which is given in that Grammar as a praxis, &ldquo;Sir, (said he,) I never made such an effort to attain Greek.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Of Dodsley&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Publick Virtue, a Poem</span>, he said, &ldquo;It was fine <span class="t8">blank</span> (meaning to express his usual contempt for blank verse); however, this miserable poem did not sell, and my poor friend Doddy said, Publick Virtue was not a subject to interest the age.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Mr. Langton, when a very young man, read Dodsley&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Cleone a Tragedy</span>, to him, not aware of his extreme impatience to be read to. As it went on he turned his face to the back of his chair, and put himself into various attitudes, which marked his uneasiness. At the end of an act, however, he said, &ldquo;Come let&rsquo;s have some more, let&rsquo;s go into the slaughter-house again, Lanky. But I am afraid there is more blood than brains.&rdquo; Yet he afterwards said, &ldquo;When I heard you read it, I thought higher of its power of language: when I read it myself, I was more sensible of its pathetick effect;&rdquo; and then he paid it a compliment which many will think very extravagant. &ldquo;Sir, (said he,) if Otway had written this play, no other of his pieces would have been remembered.&rdquo; Dodsley himself, upon this being repeated to him, said, &ldquo;It was too much:&rdquo; it must be remembered, that Johnson always appeared not to be sufficiently sensible of the merit of Otway.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Snatches of reading (said he) will not make a Bentley or a Clarke. They are, however, in a certain degree advantageous. I would put a child into a library (where no unfit books are) and let him read at his choice. A child should not be discouraged from reading any thing that he takes a liking to, from a notion that it is above his reach. If that be the case, the child will soon find it out and desist; if not, he of course gains the instruction; which is so much the more likely to come, from the inclination with which he takes up the study.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Though he used to censure carelessness with great vehemence, he owned, that he once, to avoid the trouble of locking up five guineas, hid them, he forgot where, so that he could not find them.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;A gentleman who introduced his brother to Dr. Johnson was earnest to recommend him to the Doctor&rsquo;s notice, which he did by saying, &ldquo;When we have sat together some time, you&rsquo;ll find my brother grow very entertaining.&rdquo;&mdash; &ldquo;Sir, (said Johnson,) I can wait.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;When the rumour was strong that we should have a war, because the French would assist the Americans, he rebuked a friend with some asperity for supposing it, saying, &ldquo;No, Sir, national faith is not yet sunk so low.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;In the latter part of his life, in order to satisfy himself whether his mental faculties were impaired, he resolved that he would try to learn a new language, and fixed upon the Low Dutch, for that purpose, and this he continued till he had read about one half of <span class="t8">Thomas à Kempis</span>; and finding that there appeared no abatement of his power of acquisition, he then desisted, as thinking the experiment had been duly tried. Mr. Burke justly observed, that this was not the most vigorous trial, Low Dutch being a language so near to our own; had it been one of the languages entirely different, he might have been very soon satisfied.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Mr. Langton and he having gone to see a Freemason&rsquo;s funeral procession, when they were at Rochester, and some solemn musick being played on French horns, he said, &ldquo;This is the first time that I have ever been affected by musical sounds;&rdquo; adding, &ldquo;that the impression made upon him was of a melancholy kind.&rdquo; Mr. Langton saying, that this effect was a fine one, &mdash; JOHNSON. &ldquo;Yes, if it softens the mind, so as to prepare it for the reception of salutary feelings, it may be good: but inasmuch as it is melancholy <span class="t8">per se</span>, it is bad.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Goldsmith had long a visionary project, that some time or other when his circumstances should be easier, he would go to Aleppo, in order to acquire a knowledge as far as might be of any arts peculiar to the East, and introduce them into Britain. When this was talked of in Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s company, he said, &ldquo;Of all men Goldsmith is the most unfit to go out upon such an inquiry; for he is utterly ignorant of such arts as we already possess, and consequently could not know what would be accessions to our present stock of mechanical knowledge. Sir, he would bring home a grinding barrow, which you see in every street in London, and think that he had furnished a wonderful improvement.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Greek, Sir, (said he,) is like lace; every man gets as much of it as he can.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;When Lord Charles Hay, after his return from America, was preparing his defence to be offered to the Court-Martial which he had demanded, having heard Mr. Langton as high in expressions of admiration of Johnson, as he usually was, he requested that Dr. Johnson might be introduced to him; and Mr. Langton having mentioned it to Johnson, he very kindly and readily agreed; and being presented by Mr. Langton to his Lordship, while under arrest, he saw him several times; upon one of which occasions Lord Charles read to him what he had prepared, which Johnson signified his approbation of, saying, &ldquo;It is a very good soldierly defence.&rdquo; Johnson said, that he had advised his Lordship, that as it was in vain to contend with those who were in possession of power, if they would offer him the rank of Lieutenant-General, and a government, it would be better judged to desist from urging his complaints. It is well known that his Lordship died before the sentence was made known.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Johnson one day gave high praise to Dr. Bentley&rsquo;s verses in Dodsley&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Collection</span>, which he recited with his usual energy. Dr. Adam Smith, who was present, observed in his decisive professorial manner, &ldquo;Very well &mdash; Very well.&rdquo; Johnson however added, &ldquo;Yes, they <span class="t8">are</span> very well, Sir; but you may observe in what manner they are well. They are the forcible verses of a man of a strong mind, but not accustomed to write verse; for there is some uncouthness in the expression.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Drinking tea one day at Garrick&rsquo;s with Mr. Langton, he was questioned if he was not somewhat of a heretick as to Shakspeare; said Garrick, &ldquo;I doubt he is a little of an infidel.&rdquo;&mdash; &ldquo;Sir, (said Johnson) I will stand by the lines I have written on Shakspeare in my Prologue at the opening of your Theatre.&rdquo; Mr. Langton suggested, that in the line</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;And panting Time toil&rsquo;d after him in vain,&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson might have had in his eye the passage in <span class="t8">The Tempest</span>, where Prospero says of Miranda,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo; &mdash;&mdash;&nbsp; &mdash; She will outstrip all praise,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And make it halt behind her84.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson said nothing. Garrick then ventured to observe, &ldquo;I do not think that the happiest line in the praise of Shakspeare.&rdquo; Johnson exclaimed (smiling,) &ldquo;Prosaical rogues! next time I write, I&rsquo;ll make both time and space pant.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;It is well known that there was formerly a rude custom for those who were sailing upon the Thames, to accost each other as they passed, in the most abusive language they could invent, generally, however, with as much satirical humour as they were capable of producing. Addison gives a specimen of this ribaldry, in Number 383 of <span class="t8">The Spectator</span>, when Sir Roger de Coverly and he are going to Spring-garden. Johnson was once eminently successful in this species of contest; a fellow having attacked him with some coarse raillery, Johnson answered him thus, &ldquo;Sir, your wife, <span class="t8">under pretence of keeping a bawdy-house</span>, is a receiver of stolen goods.&rdquo; One evening when he and Mr. Burke and Mr. Langton were in company together, and the admirable scolding of Timon of Athens was mentioned, this instance of Johnson&rsquo;s was quoted, and thought to have at least equal excellence.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;As Johnson always allowed the extraordinary talents of Mr. Burke, so Mr. Burke was fully sensible of the wonderful powers of Johnson. Mr. Langton recollects having passed an evening with both of them, when Mr. Burke repeatedly entered upon topicks which it was evident he would have illustrated with extensive knowledge and richness of expression; but Johnson always seized upon the conversation, in which, however, he acquitted himself in a most masterly manner. As Mr. Burke and Mr. Langton were walking home, Mr. Burke observed that Johnson had been very great that night; Mr. Langton joined in this, but added, he could have wished to hear more from another person; (plainly intimating that he meant Mr. Burke.) &ldquo;O, no (said Mr. Burke) it is enough for me to have rung the bell to him.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Beauclerk having observed to him of one of their friends, that he was aukward at counting money, &ldquo;Why, Sir, said Johnson, I am likewise aukward at counting money. But then, Sir, the reason is plain; I have had very little money to count.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;He had an abhorrence of affectation. Talking of old Mr. Langton, of whom he said, &ldquo;Sir, you will seldom see such a gentleman, such are his stores of literature, such his knowledge in divinity, and such his exemplary life;&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;and Sir, he has no grimace, no gesticulation, no bursts of admiration on trivial occasions; he never embraces you with an overacted cordiality.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Being in company with a gentleman who thought fit to maintain Dr. Berkeley&rsquo;s ingenious philosophy, that nothing exists but as perceived by some mind; when the gentleman was going away, Johnson said to him, &ldquo;Pray, Sir, don&rsquo;t leave us; for we may perhaps forget to think of you, and then you will cease to exist.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Goldsmith, upon being visited by Johnson one day in the Temple, said to him with a little jealousy of the appearance of his accommodation, &ldquo;I shall soon be in better chambers than these.&rdquo; Johnson at the same time checked him and paid him a handsome compliment, implying that a man of his talents should be above attention to such distinctions,&mdash; &lsquo;Nay, Sir, never mind that. <span class="t8">Nil te quaesiveris extra</span>.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;At the time when his pension was granted to him, he said, with a noble literary ambition, &ldquo;Had this happened twenty years years ago, I should have gone to Constantinople to learn Arabick, as Pococke did.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;As an instance of the niceness of his taste, though he praised West&rsquo;s translation of Pindar, he pointed out the following passage as faulty, by expressing a circumstance so minute as to detract from the general dignity which should prevail:</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Down then from thy glittering nail,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take, O Muse, thy Dorian <span class="t8">lyre</span>95.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;When Mr. Vesey was proposed as a member of the LITERARY CLUB, Mr. Burke began by saying that he was a man of gentle manners. &ldquo;Sir, said Johnson, you need say no more. When you have said a man of gentle manners; you have said enough.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The late Mr. Fitzherbert told Mr. Langton that Johnson said to him, &ldquo;Sir, a man has no more right to <span class="t8">say</span> an uncivil thing, than to <span class="t8">act</span> one; no more right to say a rude thing to another than to knock him down.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;My dear friend Dr. Bathurst, (said he with a warmth of approbation) declared he was glad that his father, who was a West-Indian planter, had left his affairs in total ruin, because having no estate, he was not under the temptation of having slaves.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Richardson had little conversation, except about his own works, of which Sir Joshua Reynolds said he was always willing to talk, and glad to have them introduced. Johnson when he carried Mr. Langton to see him, professed that he could bring him out into conversation, and used this allusive expression, &ldquo;Sir, I can make him <span class="t8">rear.</span>&rdquo; But he failed; for in that interview Richardson said little else than that there lay in the room a translation of his <span class="t8">Clarissa</span> into German.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Once when somebody produced a newspaper in which there was a letter of stupid abuse of Sir Joshua Reynolds, of which Johnson himself came in for a share,&mdash; &ldquo;Pray,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;let us have it read aloud from beginning to end;&rdquo; which being done, he with a ludicrous earnestness, and not directing his look to any particular person, called out, &ldquo;Are we alive after all this satire!&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;He had a strong prejudice against the political character of Seeker, one instance of which appeared at Oxford, where he expressed great dissatisfaction at his varying the old established toast, &ldquo;Church and King.&rdquo; &ldquo;The Archbishop of Canterbury, said he (with an affected smooth smiling grimace) drinks,&rsquo; Constitution in Church and State.&rsquo;&rdquo; Being asked what difference there was between the two toasts, he said, &ldquo;Why, Sir, you may be sure he meant something.&rdquo; Yet when the life of that prelate, prefixed to his sermons by Dr. Porteus and Dr. Stinton his chaplains, first came out, he read it with the utmost avidity, and said, &ldquo;It is a life well written, and that well deserves to be recorded.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Of a certain noble Lord, he said, &ldquo;Respect him, you could not; for he had no mind of his own. Love him you could not; for that which you could do with him, every one else could.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Of Dr. Goldsmith he said, &ldquo;No man was more foolish when he had not a pen in his hand, or more wise when he had.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;He told in his lively manner the following literary anecdote: &ldquo;Green and Guthrie, an Irishman and a Scotchman, undertook a translation of Duhalde&rsquo;s <span class="t8">History of China</span>. Green said of Guthrie, that he knew no English, and Guthrie of Green, that he knew no French; and these two undertook to translate Duhalde&rsquo;s <span class="t8">History of China</span>. In this translation there was found &lsquo;the twenty-sixth day of the new moon.&rsquo; Now as the whole age of the moon is but twenty-eight days, the moon instead of being new, was nearly as old as it could be. Their blunder arose from their mistaking the word <span class="t8">neuvième</span> ninth, for <span class="t8">nouvelle</span> or <span class="t8">neuve</span>, new.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Talking of Dr. Blagden&rsquo;s copiousness and precision of communication, Dr. Johnson said, &ldquo;Blagden, Sir, is a delightful fellow.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;On occasion of Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s publishing his pamphlet of <span class="t8">The False Alarm</span>, there came out a very angry answer (by many supposed to be by Mr. Wilkes). Dr. Johnson determined on not answering it; but, in conversation with Mr. Langton, mentioned a particular or two, which if he <span class="t8">had</span> replied to it, he might perhaps have inserted. In the answerer&rsquo;s pamphlet, it had been said with solemnity, &ldquo;Do you consider, Sir, that a House of Commons is to the people as a Creature is to its Creator?&rdquo; To this question, said Dr. Johnson, I could have replied, that &mdash; in the first place &mdash; the idea of a CREATOR must be such as that he has a power to unmake or annihilate his creature.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Then it cannot be conceived that a creature can make laws for its</p>
<p class="p24">CREATOR.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Depend upon it, said he, that if a man <span class="t8">talks</span> of his misfortunes, there is something in them that is not disagreeable to him; for where there is nothing but pure misery, there never is any recourse to the mention of it.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;A man must be a poor beast that should <span class="t8">read</span> no more in quantity than he could <span class="t8">utter</span> aloud.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Imlac in <span class="t8">Rasselas</span>, I spelt with a <span class="t8">c</span> at the end, because it is less like English, which should always have the Saxon <span class="t8">k</span> added to the <span class="t8">c</span>.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Many a man is mad in certain instances, and goes through life without having it perceived: for example, a madness has seized a person of supposing himself obliged literally to pray continually &mdash; had the madness turned the opposite way and the person thought it a crime ever to pray, it might not improbably have continued unobserved.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;He apprehended that the delineation of <span class="t8">characters</span> in the end of the first Book of the <span class="t8">Retreat of the Ten Thousand</span> was the first instance of the kind that was known.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Supposing (said he) a wife to be of a studious or argumentative turn, it would be very troublesome: for instance, &mdash; if a woman should continually dwell upon the subject of the Arian heresy.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;No man speaks concerning another, even suppose it be in his praise, if he thinks he does not hear him, exactly as he would, if he thought he was within hearing.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The applause of a single human being is of great consequence: This he said to me with great earnestness of manner, very near the time of his decease, on occasion of having desired me to read a letter addressed to him from some person in the North of England; which when I had done, and he asked me what the contents were, as I thought being particular upon it might fatigue him, it being of great length, I only told him in general that it was highly in his praise; &mdash; and then he expressed himself as above.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;He mentioned with an air of satisfaction what Baretti had told him; that, meeting, in the course of his studying English, with an excellent paper in the <span class="t8">Spectator</span>, one of four that were written by the respectable Dissenting Minister, Mr. Grove of Taunton, and observing the genius and energy of mind that it exhibits, it greatly quickened his curiosity to visit our country; as he thought if such were the lighter periodical essays of our authours, their productions on more weighty occasions must be wonderful indeed!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;He observed once, at Sir Joshua Reynolds&rsquo;s, that a beggar in the street will more readily ask alms from a <span class="t8">man</span>, though there should be no marks of wealth in his appearance, than from even a well-dressed woman; which he accounted for from the greater degree of carefulness as to money that is to be found in women; saying farther upon it, that the opportunities in general that they possess of improving their condition are much fewer than men have; and adding, as he looked round the company, which consisted of men only, &mdash; there is not one of us who does not think he might be richer if he would use his endeavour.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;He thus characterised an ingenious writer of his acquaintance: &ldquo;Sir, he is an enthusiast by rule.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;<span class="t8">He may hold up that SHIELD against all his enemies</span>;&rsquo; &mdash; was an observation on Homer, in reference to his description of the shield of Achilles, made by Mrs. Fitzherbert, wife to his friend Mr. Fitzherbert of Derbyshire, and respected by Dr. Johnson as a very fine one. He had in general a very high opinion of that lady&rsquo;s understanding.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;An observation of Bathurst&rsquo;s may be mentioned, which Johnson repeated, appearing to acknowledge it to be well founded, namely, it was somewhat remarkable how seldom, on occasion of coming into the company of any new person, one felt any wish or inclination to see him again.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">This year the Reverend Dr. Franklin having published a translation of <span class="t8">Lucian</span>, inscribed to him the <span class="t8">Demonax</span> thus: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To DR. SAMUEL JOHNSON, the Demonax of the present age, this piece is inscribed by a sincere admirer of his respectable talents,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;THE TRANSLATOR.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Though upon a particular comparison of Demonax and Johnson, there does not seem to be a great deal of similarity between them, this Dedication is a just compliment from the general character given by Lucian of the ancient Sage, &lsquo;[Greek: ariston on oida ego philosophon genomenon], the best philosopher whom I have ever seen or known.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">1781: AETAT. 72. &mdash; In 1781 Johnson at last completed his <span class="t8">Lives of the Poets</span>, of which he gives this account: &lsquo;Some time in March I finished the <span class="t8">Lives of the Poets</span>, which I wrote in my usual way, dilatorily and hastily, unwilling to work, and working with vigour and haste.&rsquo; In a memorandum previous to this, he says of them: &lsquo;Written, I hope, in such a manner as may tend to the promotion of piety.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">This is the work which of all Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s writings will perhaps be read most generally, and with most pleasure. Philology and biography were his favourite pursuits, and those who lived most in intimacy with him, heard him upon all occasions, when there was a proper opportunity, take delight in expatiating upon the various merits of the English Poets: upon the niceties of their characters, and the events of their progress through the world which they contributed to illuminate. His mind was so full of that kind of information, and it was so well arranged in his memory, that in performing what he had undertaken in this way, he had little more to do than to put his thoughts upon paper, exhibiting first each Poet&rsquo;s life, and then subjoining a critical examination of his genius and works. But when he began to write, the subject swelled in such a manner, that instead of prefaces to each poet, of no more than a few pages, as he had originally intended, he produced an ample, rich, and most entertaining view of them in every respect. In this he resembled Quintilian, who tells us, that in the composition of his <span class="t8">Institutions of Oratory, Latiùs se tamen aperiente materiâ, plus quàm imponebatur oneris sponte suscepi.</span> The booksellers, justly sensible of the great additional value of the copy-right, presented him with another hundred pounds, over and above two hundred, for which his agreement was to furnish such prefaces as he thought fit.</p>
<p class="p24">This was, however, but a small recompense for such a collection of biography, and such principles and illustrations of criticism, as, if digested and arranged in one system, by some modern Aristotle or Longinus, might form a code upon that subject, such as no other nation can shew. As he was so good as to make me a present of the greatest part of the original and indeed only manuscript of this admirable work, I have an opportunity of observing with wonder, the correctness with which he rapidly struck off such glowing composition. He may be assimilated to the Lady in Waller, who could impress with &lsquo;Love at first sight:&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Some other nymphs with colours faint,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And pencil slow may Cupid paint,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a weak heart in time destroy;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has a stamp, and prints the boy129.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">That he, however, had a good deal of trouble, and some anxiety in carrying on the work, we see from a series of letters to Mr. Nichols the printer, whose variety of literary inquiry and obliging disposition, rendered him useful to Johnson. Mr. Steevens appears, from the papers in my possession, to have supplied him with some anecdotes and quotations; and I observe the fair hand of Mrs. Thrale as one of his copyists of select passages. But he was principally indebted to my steady friend Mr. Isaac Reed, of Staple-inn, whose extensive and accurate knowledge of English literary history I do not express with exaggeration, when I say it is wonderful; indeed his labours have proved it to the world; and all who have the pleasure of his acquaintance can bear testimony to the frankness of his communications in private society.</p>
<p class="p24">It is not my intention to dwell upon each of Johnson&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Lives of the Poets</span>, or attempt an analysis of their merits, which, were I able to do it, would take up too much room in this work; yet I shall make a few observations upon some of them, and insert a few various readings.</p>
<p class="p24">The Life of COWLEY he himself considered as the best of the whole, on account of the dissertation which it contains on the <span class="t8">Metaphysical Poets</span>. Dryden, whose critical abilities were equal to his poetical, had mentioned them in his excellent Dedication of his Juvenal, but had barely mentioned them. Johnson has exhibited them at large, with such happy illustration from their writings, and in so luminous a manner, that indeed he may be allowed the full merit of novelty, and to have discovered to us, as it were, a new planet in the poetical hemisphere.</p>
<p class="p24">It is remarked by Johnson, in considering the works of a poet, that &lsquo;amendments are seldom made without some token of a rent;&rsquo; but I do not find that this is applicable to prose. We shall see that though his amendments in this work are for the better, there is nothing of the <span class="t8">pannus assutus</span>; the texture is uniform: and indeed, what had been there at first, is very seldom unfit to have remained.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Various Readings in the Life of COWLEY.</span></p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;All [future votaries of] <span class="t8">that may hereafter pant for</span> solitude.</p>

<p class="p24">&lsquo;The wide effulgence of [the blazing] a <span class="t8">summer</span> noon.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">In the Life of WALLER, Johnson gives a distinct and animated narrative of publick affairs in that variegated period, with strong yet nice touches of character; and having a fair opportunity to display his political principles, does it with an unqualified manly confidence, and satisfies his readers how nobly he might have executed a <span class="t8">Tory History</span> of his country.</p>
<p class="p24">So easy is his style in these Lives, that I do not recollect more than three uncommon or learned words; one, when giving an account of the approach of Waller&rsquo;s mortal disease, he says, &lsquo;he found his legs grow <span class="t8">tumid</span>;&rsquo; by using the expression his legs <span class="t8">swelled</span>, he would have avoided this; and there would have been no impropriety in its being followed by the interesting question to his physician, &lsquo;What that <span class="t8">swelling</span> meant?&rsquo; Another, when he mentions that Pope had <span class="t8">emitted</span> proposals; when <span class="t8">published</span> or <span class="t8">issued</span> would have been more readily understood; and a third, when he calls Orrery and Dr. Delany, writers both undoubtedly <span class="t8">veracious</span>, when <span class="t8">true, honest</span>, or <span class="t8">faithful</span>, might have been used. Yet, it must be owned, that none of these are <span class="t8">hard</span> or <span class="t8">too big</span> words; that custom would make them seem as easy as any others; and that a language is richer and capable of more beauty of expression, by having a greater variety of synonimes.</p>
<p class="p24">His dissertation upon the unfitness of poetry for the aweful subjects of our holy religion, though I do not entirely agree with with him, has all the merit of originality, with uncommon force and reasoning.</p>

<p class="p24">Against his Life of MILTON, the hounds of Whiggism have opened in full cry. But of Milton&rsquo;s great excellence as a poet, where shall we find such a blazon as by the hand of Johnson? I shall select only the following passage concerning <span class="t8">Paradise Lost</span>:</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Fancy can hardly forbear to conjecture with what temper Milton surveyed the silent progress of his work, and marked his reputation stealing its way in a kind of subterraneous current, through fear and silence. I cannot but conceive him calm and confident, little disappointed, not at all dejected, relying on his own merit with steady consciousness, and waiting without impatience the vicissitudes of opinion, and the impartiality of a future generation.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Indeed even Dr. Towers, who may be considered as one of the warmest zealots of <span class="t8">The Revolution Society</span> itself, allows, that &lsquo;Johnson has spoken in the highest terms of the abilities of that great poet, and has bestowed on his principal poetical compositions the most honourable encomiums.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">That a man, who venerated the Church and Monarchy as Johnson did, should speak with a just abhorrence of Milton as a politician, or rather as a daring foe to good polity, was surely to be expected; and to those who censure him, I would recommend his commentary on Milton&rsquo;s celebrated complaint of his situation, when by the lenity of Charles the Second, &lsquo;a lenity of which (as Johnson well observes) the world has had perhaps no other example, he, who had written in justification of the murder of his Sovereign, was safe under an Act of Oblivion.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;No sooner is he safe than he finds himself in danger, <span class="t8">fallen on evil days and evil tongues</span>, [and] <span class="t8">with darkness and with danger compassed round</span>. This darkness, had his eyes been better employed, had undoubtedly deserved compassion; but to add the mention of danger, was ungrateful and unjust. He was fallen, indeed, on <span class="t8">evil days</span>; the time was come in which regicides could no longer boast their wickedness. But of <span class="t8">evil tongues</span> for Milton to complain, required impudence at least equal to his other powers; Milton, whose warmest advocates must allow, that he never spared any asperity of reproach, or brutality of insolence.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I have, indeed, often wondered how Milton, &lsquo;an acrimonious and surly Republican,&rsquo;&mdash; &lsquo;a man who in his domestick relations was so severe and arbitrary,&rsquo; and whose head was filled with the hardest and most dismal tenets of Calvinism, should have been such a poet; should not only have written with sublimity, but with beauty, and even gaiety; should have exquisitely painted the sweetest sensations of which our nature is capable; imaged the delicate raptures of connubial love; nay, seemed to be animated with all the spirit of revelry. It is a proof that in the human mind the departments of judgement and imagination, perception and temper, may sometimes be divided by strong partitions; and that the light and shade in the same character may be kept so distinct as never to be blended.</p>
<p class="p24">In the Life of Milton, Johnson took occasion to maintain his own and the general opinion of the excellence of rhyme over blank verse, in English poetry; and quotes this apposite illustration of it by &lsquo;an ingenious critick,&rsquo; that <span class="t8">it seems to be verse only to the eye</span>. The gentleman whom he thus characterises, is (as he told Mr. Seward) Mr. Lock, of Norbury Park, in Surrey, whose knowledge and taste in the fine arts is universally celebrated; with whose elegance of manners the writer of the present work has felt himself much impressed, and to whose virtues a common friend, who has known him long, and is not much addicted to flattery, gives the highest testimony.</p>

<p class="p24">&lsquo;I cannot find any meaning but this which [his most bigotted advocates] <span class="t8">even kindness and reverence</span> can give.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;[Perhaps no] <span class="t8">scarcely any</span> man ever wrote so much, and praised so few.</p>

<p class="p24">I could, with pleasure, expatiate upon the masterly execution of the Life of DRYDEN, which we have seen was one of Johnson&rsquo;s literary projects at an early period, and which it is remarkable, that after desisting from it, from a supposed scantiness of materials, he should, at an advanced age, have exhibited so amply.</p>
<p class="p24">His defence of that great poet against the illiberal attacks upon him, as if his embracing the Roman Catholick communion had been a time-serving measure, is a piece of reasoning at once able and candid. Indeed, Dryden himself, in his <span class="t8">Hind and Panther</span>, has given such a picture of his mind, that they who know the anxiety for repose as to the aweful subject of our state beyond the grave, though they may think his opinion ill-founded, must think charitably of his sentiment: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;But, gracious GOD, how well dost thou provide</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For erring judgements an unerring guide!</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy throne is darkness in the abyss of light,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A blaze of glory that forbids the sight.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O! teach me to believe thee thus conceal&rsquo;d,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And search no farther than thyself reveal&rsquo;d;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Her alone for my director take,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whom thou hast promis&rsquo;d never to forsake.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My thoughtless youth was wing&rsquo;d with vain desires;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My manhood long misled by wand&rsquo;ring fires,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Follow&rsquo;d false lights; and when their glimpse was gone,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My pride struck out new sparkles of her own.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such was I, such by Nature still I am;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be thine the glory, and be mine the shame.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good life be now my task: my doubts are done;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What more could shock160 my faith than Three in One?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">In drawing Dryden&rsquo;s character, Johnson has given, though I suppose unintentionally, some touches of his own. Thus:&mdash; &lsquo;The power that predominated in his intellectual operations was rather strong reason than quick sensibility. Upon all occasions that were presented, he studied rather than felt; and produced sentiments not such as Nature enforces, but meditation supplies. With the simple and elemental passions as they spring separate in the mind, he seems not much acquainted. He is, therefore, with all his variety of excellence, not often pathetick; and had so little sensibility of the power of effusions purely natural, that he did not esteem them in others.&rsquo; It may indeed be observed, that in all the numerous writings of Johnson, whether in prose or verse, and even in his Tragedy, of which the subject is the distress of an unfortunate Princess, there is not a single passage that ever drew a tear.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Various Readings in the Life of</span> DRYDEN.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The reason of this general perusal, Addison has attempted to [find in] <span class="t8">derive from</span> the delight which the mind feels in the investigation of secrets.</p>

<p class="p24">The Life of POPE was written by Johnson <span class="t8">con amore</span>, both from the early possession which that writer had taken of his mind, and from the pleasure which he must have felt, in for ever silencing all attempts to lessen his poetical fame, by demonstrating his excellence, and pronouncing the following triumphant eulogium:&mdash; &lsquo;After all this, it is surely superfluous to answer the question that has once been asked, Whether Pope was a poet? otherwise than by asking in return, If Pope be not a poet, where is poetry to be found? To circumscribe poetry by a definition, will only shew the narrowness of the definer; though a definition which shall exclude Pope will not easily be made. Let us look round upon the present time, and back upon the past; let us enquire to whom the voice of mankind has decreed the wreath of poetry; let their productions be examined, and their claims stated, and the pretensions of Pope will be no more disputed.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I remember once to have heard Johnson say, &lsquo;Sir, a thousand years may elapse before there shall appear another man with a power of versification equal to that of Pope.&rsquo; That power must undoubtedly be allowed its due share in enhancing the value of his captivating composition.</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson, who had done liberal justice to Warburton in his edition of <span class="t8">Shakspeare</span>, which was published during the life of that powerful writer, with still greater liberality took an opportunity, in the Life of Pope, of paying the tribute due to him when he was no longer in &lsquo;high place,&rsquo; but numbered with the dead.</p>
<p class="p24">It seems strange, that two such men as Johnson and Warburton, who lived in the same age and country, should not only not have been in any degree of intimacy, but been almost personally unacquainted. But such instances, though we must wonder at them, are not rare. If I am rightly informed, after a careful enquiry, they never met but once, which was at the house of Mrs. French, in London, well known for her elegant assemblies, and bringing eminent characters together. The interview proved to be mutually agreeable.</p>
<p class="p24">I am well informed, that Warburton said of Johnson, &lsquo;I admire him, but I cannot bear his style:&rsquo; and that Johnson being told of this, said, &lsquo;That is exactly my case as to him.&rsquo; The manner in which he expressed his admiration of the fertility of Warburton&rsquo;s genius and of the variety of his materials was, &lsquo;The table is always full, Sir. He brings things from the north, and the south, and from every quarter. In his <span class="t8">Divine Legation</span>, you are always entertained. He carries you round and round, without carrying you forward to the point; but then you have no wish to be carried forward.&rsquo; He said to the Reverend Mr. Strahan, &lsquo;Warburton is perhaps the last man who has written with a mind full of reading and reflection.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">It is remarkable, that in the Life of Broome, Johnson takes notice of Dr. Warburton using a mode of expression which he himself used, and that not seldom, to the great offence of those who did not know him. Having occasion to mention a note, stating the different parts which were executed by the associated translators of <span class="t8">The Odyssey</span>, he says, &lsquo;Dr. Warburton told me, in his warm language, that he thought the relation given in the note <span class="t8">a lie</span>. The language is <span class="t8">warm</span> indeed; and, I must own, cannot be justified in consistency with a decent regard to the established forms of speech. Johnson had accustomed himself to use the word <span class="t8">lie</span>, to express a mistake or an errour in relation; in short, when the <span class="t8">thing was not so as told</span>, though the relator did not <span class="t8">mean</span> to deceive. When he thought there was intentional falsehood in the relator, his expression was, &lsquo;He <span class="t8">lies</span>, and he <span class="t8">knows</span> he <span class="t8">lies</span>.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Speaking of Pope&rsquo;s not having been known to excel in conversation, Johnson observes, that &lsquo;traditional memory retains no sallies of raillery, or sentences of observation; nothing either pointed or solid, wise or merry; and that one apophthegm only is recorded.&rsquo; In this respect, Pope differed widely from Johnson, whose conversation was, perhaps, more admirable than even his writings, however excellent. Mr. Wilkes has, however, favoured me with one repartee of Pope, of which Johnson was not informed. Johnson, after justly censuring him for having &lsquo;nursed in his mind a foolish dis-esteem of Kings,&rsquo; tells us, &lsquo;yet a little regard shewn him by the Prince of Wales melted his obduracy; and he had not much to say when he was asked by his Royal Highness, <span class="t8">how he could love a Prince, while he disliked Kings</span>?&rsquo; The answer which Pope made, was, &lsquo;The young lion is harmless, and even playful; but when his claws are full grown he becomes cruel, dreadful, and mischievous.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">But although we have no collection of Pope&rsquo;s sayings, it is not therefore to be concluded, that he was not agreeable in social intercourse; for Johnson has been heard to say, that &lsquo;the happiest conversation is that of which nothing is distinctly remembered but a general effect of pleasing impression.&rsquo; The late Lord Somerville, who saw much both of great and brilliant life, told me, that he had dined in company with Pope, and that after dinner the <span class="t8">little man</span>, as he called him, drank his bottle of Burgundy, and was exceedingly gay and entertaining.</p>
<p class="p24">I cannot withhold from my great friend a censure of at least culpable inattention, to a nobleman, who, it has been shewn, behaved to him with uncommon politeness. He says, &lsquo;Except Lord Bathurst, none of Pope&rsquo;s noble friends were such as that a good man would wish to have his intimacy with them known to posterity.&rsquo; This will not apply to Lord Mansfield, who was not ennobled in Pope&rsquo;s life-time; but Johnson should have recollected, that Lord Marchmont was one of those noble friends. He includes his Lordship along with Lord Bolingbroke, in a charge of neglect of the papers which Pope left by his will; when, in truth, as I myself pointed out to him, before he wrote that poet&rsquo;s life, the papers were &lsquo;committed to <span class="t8">the sole care and judgement</span> of Lord Bolingbroke, unless he (Lord Bolingbroke) shall not survive me;&rsquo; so that Lord Marchmont had no concern whatever with them. After the first edition of the <span class="t8">Lives</span>, Mr. Malone, whose love of justice is equal to his accuracy, made, in my hearing, the same remark to Johnson; yet he omitted to correct the erroneous statement. These particulars I mention, in the belief that there was only forgetfulness in my friend; but I owe this much to the Earl of Marchmont&rsquo;s reputation, who, were there no other memorials, will be immortalised by that line of Pope, in the verses on his Grotto:</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;And the bright flame was shot through Marchmont&rsquo;s soul.&rsquo;</p>

<p class="p24">In the Life of ADDISON we find an unpleasing account of his having lent Steele a hundred pounds, and &lsquo;reclaimed his loan by an execution.&rsquo; In the new edition of the <span class="t8">Biographia Britannica</span>, the authenticity of this anecdote is denied. But Mr. Malone has obliged me with the following note concerning it: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Many persons having doubts concerning this fact, I applied to Dr. Johnson to learn on what authority he asserted it. He told me, he had it from Savage, who lived in intimacy with Steele, and who mentioned, that Steele told him the story with tears in his eyes. &mdash; Ben Victor, Dr. Johnson said, likewise informed him of this remarkable transaction, from the relation of Mr. Wilkes the comedian, who was also an intimate of Steele&rsquo;s. &mdash; Some in defence of Addison, have said, that &ldquo;the act was done with the good natured view of rousing Steele, and correcting that profusion which always made him necessitous.&rdquo;&mdash; &ldquo;If that were the case, (said Johnson,) and that he only wanted to alarm Steele, he would afterwards have <span class="t8">returned</span> the money to his friend, which it is not pretended he did.&rdquo;&mdash; &ldquo;This too, (he added,) might be retorted by an advocate for Steele, who might alledge, that he did not repay the loan <span class="t8">intentionally</span>, merely to see whether Addison would be mean and ungenerous enough to make use of legal process to recover it. But of such speculations there is no end: we cannot dive into the hearts of men; but their actions are open to observation.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I then mentioned to him that some people thought that Mr. Addison&rsquo;s character was so pure, that the fact, <span class="t8">though true</span>, ought to have been suppressed. He saw no reason for this. &ldquo;If nothing but the bright side of characters should be shewn, we should sit down in despondency, and think it utterly impossible to imitate them in <span class="t8">any thing</span>. The sacred writers (he observed) related the vicious as well as the virtuous actions of men; which had this moral effect, that it kept mankind from <span class="t8">despair</span>, into which otherwise they would naturally fall, were they not supported by the recollection that others had offended like themselves, and by penitence and amendment of life had been restored to the favour of Heaven.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="p24">In the Life of LYTTELTON, Johnson seems to have been not favourably disposed towards that nobleman. Mrs. Thrale suggests that he was offended by <span class="t8">Molly Aston&rsquo;s</span> preference of his Lordship to him. I can by no means join in the censure bestowed by Johnson on his Lordship, whom he calls &lsquo;poor Lyttelton,&rsquo; for returning thanks to the Critical Reviewers for having &lsquo;kindly commended&rsquo; his <span class="t8">Dialogues of the Dead</span>. Such &lsquo;acknowledgements (says my friend) never can be proper, since they must be paid either for flattery or for justice.&rsquo; In my opinion, the most upright man, who has been tried on a false accusation, may, when he is acquitted, make a bow to his jury. And when those who are so much the arbiters of literary merit, as in a considerable degree to influence the publick opinion, review an authour&rsquo;s work, <span class="t8">placido lumine</span>, when I am afraid mankind in general are better pleased with severity, he may surely express a grateful sense of their civility.</p>

<p class="p24">As the introduction to his critical examination of the genius and writings of YOUNG, he did Mr. Herbert Croft, then a Barrister of Lincoln&rsquo;s-inn, now a clergyman, the honour to adopt a <span class="t8">Life of Young</span> written by that gentleman, who was the friend of Dr. Young&rsquo;s son, and wished to vindicate him from some very erroneous remarks to his prejudice. Mr. Croft&rsquo;s performance was subjected to the revision of Dr. Johnson, as appears from the following note to Mr. John Nichols: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;This <span class="t8">Life of Dr. Young</span> was written by a friend of his son. What is crossed with black is expunged by the authour, what is crossed with red is expunged by me. If you find any thing more that can be well omitted, I shall not be sorry to see it yet shorter&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">It has always appeared to me to have a considerable share of merit, and to display a pretty successful imitation of Johnson&rsquo;s style. When I mentioned this to a very eminent literary character, he opposed me vehemently, exclaiming, &lsquo;No, no, it is <span class="t8">not</span> a good imitation of Johnson; it has all his pomp without his force; it has all the nodosities of the oak without its strength.&rsquo; This was an image so happy, that one might have thought he would have been satisfied with it; but he was not. And setting his mind again to work, he added, with exquisite felicity, &lsquo;It has all the contortions of the Sybil, without the inspiration.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Mr. Croft very properly guards us against supposing that Young was a gloomy man; and mentions, that &lsquo;his parish was indebted to the good-humour of the authour of the <span class="t8">Night Thoughts</span> for an Assembly and a Bowling-Green.&rsquo; A letter from a noble foreigner is quoted, in which he is said to have been &lsquo;very pleasant in conversation.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Mr. Langton, who frequently visited him, informs me, that there was an air of benevolence in his manner, but that he could obtain from him less information than he had hoped to receive from one who had lived so much in intercourse with the brightest men of what has been called the Augustan age of England; and that he shewed a degree of eager curiosity concerning the common occurrences that were then passing, which appeared somewhat remarkable in a man of such intellectual stores, of such an advanced age, and who had retired from life with declared disappointment in his expectations.</p>
<p class="p24">An instance at once of his pensive turn of mind, and his cheerfulness of temper, appeared in a little story which he himself told to Mr. Langton, when they were walking in his garden: &lsquo;Here (said he) I had put a handsome sun-dial, with this inscription, <span class="t8">Eheu fugaces!</span> which (speaking with a smile) was sadly verified, for by the next morning my dial had been carried off.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;It gives me much pleasure to observe, that however Johnson may have casually talked, yet when he sits, as &ldquo;an ardent judge zealous to his trust, giving sentence&rdquo;&nbsp; upon the excellent works of Young, he allows them the high praise to which they are justly entitled. &ldquo;The <span class="t8">Universal Passion</span> (says he) is indeed a very great performance, &mdash; his distichs have the weight of solid sentiment, and his points the sharpness of resistless truth.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">But I was most anxious concerning Johnson&rsquo;s decision upon <span class="t8">Night Thoughts</span>, which I esteem as a mass of the grandest and richest poetry that human genius has ever produced; and was delighted to find this character of that work: &lsquo;In his <span class="t8">Night Thoughts</span>, he has exhibited a very wide display of original poetry, variegated with deep reflections and striking allusions; a wilderness of thought, in which the fertility of fancy scatters flowers of every hue and of every odour. This is one of the few poems in which blank verse could not be changed for rhime but with disadvantage.&rsquo; And afterwards, &lsquo;Particular lines are not to be regarded; the power is in the whole; and in the whole there is a magnificence like that ascribed to Chinese plantation, the magnificence of vast extent and endless diversity.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">But there is in this Poem not only all that Johnson so well brings in view, but a power of the <span class="t8">Pathetick</span> beyond almost any example that I have seen. He who does not feel his nerves shaken, and his heart pierced by many passages in this extraordinary work, particularly by that most affecting one, which describes the gradual torment suffered by the contemplation of an object of affectionate attachment, visibly and certainly decaying into dissolution, must be of a hard and obstinate frame.</p>
<p class="p24">To all the other excellencies of <span class="t8">Night Thoughts</span> let me add the great and peculiar one, that they contain not only the noblest sentiments of virtue, and contemplations on immortality, but the <span class="t8">Christian Sacrifice</span>, the <span class="t8">Divine Propitiation</span>, with all its interesting circumstances, and consolations to &lsquo;a wounded spirit,&rsquo; solemnly and poetically displayed in such imagery and language, as cannot fail to exalt, animate, and soothe the truly pious. No book whatever can be recommended to young persons, with better hopes of seasoning their minds with <span class="t8">vital religion</span>, than YOUNG&rsquo;S <span class="t8">Night Thoughts</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">In the Life of SWIFT, it appears to me that Johnson had a certain degree of prejudice against that extraordinary man, of which I have elsewhere had occasion to speak. Mr. Thomas Sheridan imputed it to a supposed apprehension in Johnson, that Swift had not been sufficiently active in obtaining for him an Irish degree when it was solicited, but of this there was not sufficient evidence; and let me not presume to charge Johnson with injustice, because he did not think so highly of the writings of this authour, as I have done from my youth upwards. Yet that he had an unfavourable bias is evident, were it only from that passage in which he speaks of Swift&rsquo;s practice of saving, as, &lsquo;first ridiculous and at last detestable;&rsquo; and yet after some examination of circumstances, finds himself obliged to own, that &lsquo;it will perhaps appear that he only liked one mode of expence better than another, and saved merely that he might have something to give.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">One observation which Johnson makes in Swift&rsquo;s life should be often inculcated: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;It may be justly supposed, that there was in his conversation what appears so frequently in his letters, an affectation of familiarity with the great, an ambition of momentary equality, sought and enjoyed by the neglect of those ceremonies which custom has established as the barriers between one order of society and another. This transgression of regularity was by himself and his admirers termed greatness of soul; but a great mind disdains to hold any thing by courtesy, and therefore never usurps what a lawful claimant may take away. He that encroaches on another&rsquo;s dignity puts himself in his power; he is either repelled with helpless indignity, or endured by clemency and condescension.&rsquo;</p>

Indeed a different order is observed in the original publication, and in the collection of Johnson&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Works</span>. And should it be objected, that many of my various readings are inconsiderable, those who make the objection will be pleased to consider, that such small particulars are intended for those who are nicely critical in composition, to whom they will be an acceptable selection.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Spence&rsquo;s Anecdotes</span>, which are frequently quoted and referred to in Johnson&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Lives of the Poets</span>, are in a manuscript collection, made by the Reverend Mr. Joseph Spence, containing a number of particulars concerning eminent men. To each anecdote is marked the name of the person on whose authority it is mentioned. This valuable collection is the property of the Duke of Newcastle, who upon the application of Sir Lucas Pepys, was pleased to permit it to be put into the hands of Dr. Johnson, who I am sorry to think made but an aukward return. &lsquo;Great assistance (says he) has been given me by Mr. Spence&rsquo;s Collection, of which I consider the communication as a favour worthy of publick acknowledgement;&rsquo; but he has not owned to whom he was obliged; so that the acknowledgement is unappropriated to his Grace.</p>
<p class="p24">While the world in general was filled with admiration of Johnson&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Lives of the Poets</span>, there were narrow circles in which prejudice and resentment were fostered, and from which attacks of different sorts issued against him. By some violent Whigs he was arraigned of injustice to Milton; by some Cambridge men of depreciating Gray; and his expressing with a dignified freedom what he really thought of George, Lord Lyttelton, gave offence to some of the friends of that nobleman, and particularly produced a declaration of war against him from Mrs. Montagu, the ingenious Essayist on Shakspeare, between whom and his Lordship a commerce of reciprocal compliments had long been carried on. In this war the smaller powers in alliance with him were of course led to engage, at least on the defensive, and thus I for one was excluded from the enjoyment of &lsquo;A Feast of Reason,&rsquo; such as Mr. Cumberland has described, with a keen, yet just and delicate pen, in his <span class="t8">Observer</span>. These minute inconveniencies gave not the least disturbance to Johnson. He nobly said, when I talked to him of the feeble, though shrill outcry which had been raised, &lsquo;Sir, I considered myself as entrusted with a certain portion of truth. I have given my opinion sincerely; let them shew where they think me wrong.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">While my friend is thus contemplated in the splendour derived from his last and perhaps most admirable work, I introduce him with peculiar propriety as the correspondent of WARREN HASTINGS! a man whose regard reflects dignity even upon JOHNSON; a man, the extent of whose abilities was equal to that of his power; and who, by those who are fortunate enough to know him in private life, is admired for his literature and taste, and beloved for the candour, moderation, and mildness of his character. Were I capable of paying a suitable tribute of admiration to him, I should certainly not withhold it at a moment when it is not possible that I should be suspected of being an interested flatterer. But how weak would be my voice after that of the millions whom he governed. His condescending and obliging compliance with my solicitation, I with humble gratitude acknowledge; and while by publishing his letter to me, accompanying the valuable communication, I do eminent honour to my great friend, I shall entirely disregard any invidious suggestions, that as I in some degree participate in the honour, I have, at the same time, the gratification of my own vanity in view.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;TO JAMES BOSWELL, ESQ. Park Lane, Dec. 2, 1790.</p>
<p class="p24">SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">I have been fortunately spared the troublesome suspense of a long search, to which, in performance of my promise, I had devoted this morning, by lighting upon the objects of it among the first papers that I laid my hands on: my veneration for your great and good friend, Dr. Johnson, and the pride, or I hope something of a better sentiment, which I indulged in possessing such memorials of his good will towards me, having induced me to bind them in a parcel containing other select papers, and labelled with the titles appertaining to them. They consist but of three letters, which I believe were all that I ever received from Dr. Johnson. Of these, one, which was written in quadruplicate, under the different dates of its respective dispatches, has already been made publick, but not from any communication of mine. This, however, I have joined to the rest; and have now the pleasure of sending them to you for the use to which you informed me it was your desire to destine them.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;My promise was pledged with the condition, that if the letters were found to contain any thing which should render them improper for the publick eye, you would dispense with the performance of it. You will have the goodness, I am sure, to pardon my recalling this stipulation to your recollection, as I should be both to appear negligent of that obligation which is always implied in an epistolary confidence. In the reservation of that right I have read them over with the most scrupulous attention, but have not seen in them the slightest cause on that ground to withhold them from you. But, though not on that, yet on another ground I own I feel a little, yet but a little, reluctance to part with them: I mean on that of my own credit, which I fear will suffer by the information conveyed by them, that I was early in the possession of such valuable instructions for the beneficial employment of the influence of my late station, and (as it may seem) have so little availed myself of them. Whether I could, if it were necessary, defend myself against such an imputation, it little concerns the world to know. I look only to the effect which these relicks may produce, considered as evidences of the virtues of their authour: and believing that they will be found to display an uncommon warmth of private friendship, and a mind ever attentive to the improvement and extension of useful knowledge, and solicitous for the interests of mankind, I can cheerfully submit to the little sacrifice of my own fame, to contribute to the illustration of so great and venerable a character. They cannot be better applied, for that end, than by being entrusted to your hands. Allow me, with this offering, to infer from it a proof of the very great esteem with which I have the honour to profess myself, Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your most obedient</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And most humble servant,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;WARREN HASTINGS.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;<span class="t8">P.S</span>. At some future time, and when you have no further occasion for these papers, I shall be obliged to you if you would return them.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">The last of the three letters thus graciously put into my hands, and which has already appeared in publick, belongs to this year; but I shall previously insert the first two in the order of their dates. They altogether form a grand group in my biographical picture.</p>
<p class="p24">TO THE HONOURABLE WARREN HASTINGS, ESQ.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">Though I have had but little personal knowledge of you, I have had enough to make me wish for more; and though it be now a long time since I was honoured by your visit, I had too much pleasure from it to forget it. By those whom we delight to remember, we are unwilling to be forgotten; and therefore I cannot omit this opportunity of reviving myself in your memory by a letter which you will receive from the hands of my friend Mr. Chambers; a man, whose purity of manners and vigour of mind are sufficient to make every thing welcome that he brings.</p>
<p class="p24">That this is my only reason for writing, will be too apparent by the uselessness of my letter to any other purpose. I have no questions to ask; not that I want curiosity after either the ancient or present state of regions in which have been seen all the power and splendour of wide-extended empire; and which, as by some grant of natural superiority, supply the rest of the world with almost all that pride desires and luxury enjoys. But my knowledge of them is too scanty to furnish me with proper topicks of enquiry; I can only wish for information; and hope, that a mind comprehensive like yours will find leisure, amidst the cares of your important station, to enquire into many subjects of which the European world either thinks not at all, or thinks with deficient intelligence and uncertain conjecture. I shall hope, that he who once intended to increase the learning of his country by the introduction of the Persian language, will examine nicely the traditions and histories of the East; that he will survey the wonders of its ancient edifices, and trace the vestiges of its ruined cities; and that, at his return, we shall know the arts and opinions of a race of men, from whom very little has been hitherto derived.</p>
<p class="p24">You, Sir, have no need of being told by me, how much may be added by your attention and patronage to experimental knowledge and natural history. There are arts of manufacture practised in the countries in which you preside, which are yet very imperfectly known here, either to artificers or philosophers. Of the natural productions, animate and inanimate, we yet have so little intelligence, that our books are filled, I fear, with conjectures about things which an Indian peasant knows by his senses.</p>
<p class="p24">Many of those things my first wish is to see; my second to know, by such accounts as a man like you will be able to give.</p>
<p class="p24">As I have not skill to ask proper questions, I have likewise no such access to great men as can enable me to send you any political information. Of the agitations of an unsettled government, and the struggles of a feeble ministry, care is doubtless taken to give you more exact accounts than I can obtain. If you are inclined to interest yourself much in publick transactions, it is no misfortune to you to be so distant from them.</p>
<p class="p24">That literature is not totally forsaking us, and that your favourite language is not neglected, will appear from the book, which I should have pleased myself more with sending, if I could have presented it bound: but time was wanting. I beg, however, Sir, that you will accept it from a man very desirous of your regard; and that if you think me able to gratify you by any thing more important you will employ me.</p>
<p class="p24">I am now going to take leave, perhaps a very long leave, of my dear Mr. Chambers. That he is going to live where you govern, may justly alleviate the regret of parting; and the hope of seeing both him and you again, which I am not willing to mingle with doubt, must at present comfort as it can, Sir, Your most humble servant,</p>

<p class="p24">To THE SAME.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">Being informed that by the departure of a ship, there is now an opportunity of writing to Bengal, I am unwilling to slip out of your memory by my own negligence, and therefore take the liberty of reminding you of my existence, by sending you a book which is not yet made publick.</p>
<p class="p24">I have lately visited a region less remote, and less illustrious than India, which afforded some occasions for speculation; what has occurred to me, I have put into the volume, of which I beg your acceptance.</p>
<p class="p24">Men in your station seldom have presents totally disinterested; my book is received, let me now make my request.</p>
<p class="p24">There is, Sir, somewhere within your government, a young adventurer, one Chauncey Lawrence, whose father is one of my oldest friends. Be pleased to shew the young man what countenance is fit, whether he wants to be restrained by your authority, or encouraged by your favour. His father is now President of the College of Physicians, a man venerable for his knowledge, and more venerable for his virtue.</p>
<p class="p24">I wish you a prosperous government, a safe return, and a long enjoyment of plenty and tranquillity.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am, Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your most obedient</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And most humble servant,</p>

<p class="p24">TO THE SAME.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Jan. 9, 1781.</p>
<p class="p24">Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">Amidst the importance and multiplicity of affairs in which your great office engages you, I take the liberty of recalling your attention for a moment to literature, and will not prolong the interruption by an apology which your character makes needless.</p>
<p class="p24">Mr. Hoole, a gentleman long known, and long esteemed in the India-House, after having translated Tasso, has undertaken Ariosto. How well he is qualified for his undertaking he has already shewn. He is desirous, Sir, of your favour in promoting his proposals, and flatters me by supposing that my testimony may advance his interest.</p>
<p class="p24">It is a new thing for a clerk of the India-House to translate poets; &mdash; it is new for a Governour of Bengal to patronize learning. That he may find his ingenuity rewarded, and that learning may flourish under your protection, is the wish of, Sir, Your most humble servant,</p>
<p class="p24">SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I wrote to him in February, complaining of having been troubled by a recurrence of the perplexing question of Liberty and Necessity; &mdash; and mentioning that I hoped soon to meet him again in London.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To JAMES BOSWELL, ESQ.</p>
<p class="p24">DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">I hoped you had got rid of all this hypocrisy of misery. What have you to do with Liberty and Necessity? Or what more than to hold your tongue about it? Do not doubt but I shall be most heartily glad to see you here again, for I love every part about you but your affectation of distress.</p>
<p class="p24">I have at last finished my <span class="t8">Lives</span>, and have laid up for you a load of copy, all out of order, so that it will amuse you a long time to set it right. Come to me, my dear Bozzy, and let us be as happy as we can. We will go again to the Mitre, and talk old times over.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am, dear Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yours affectionately,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">March, 14, 1781.</p>
<p class="p24">On Monday, March 19, I arrived in London, and on Tuesday, the 20th, met him in Fleet-street, walking, or rather indeed moving along; for his peculiar march is thus described in a very just and picturesque manner, in a short Life of him published very soon after his death:&mdash; &lsquo;When he walked the streets, what with the constant roll of his head, and the concomitant motion of his body, he appeared to make his way by that motion, independent of his feet.&rsquo; That he was often much stared at while he advanced in this manner, may easily be believed; but it was not safe to make sport of one so robust as he was. Mr. Langton saw him one day, in a fit of absence, by a sudden start, drive the load off a porter&rsquo;s back, and walk forward briskly, without being conscious of what he had done.</p>
<p class="p24">The porter was very angry, but stood still, and eyed the huge figure with much earnestness, till he was satisfied that his wisest course was to be quiet, and take up his burthen again.</p>
<p class="p24">Our accidental meeting in the street after a long separation was a pleasing surprize to us both. He stepped aside with me into Falcon-court, and made kind inquiries about my family, and as we were in a hurry going different ways, I promised to call on him next day; he said he was engaged to go out in the morning. &lsquo;Early, Sir?&rsquo; said I. JOHNSON: &lsquo;Why, Sir, a London morning does not go with the sun.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I waited on him next evening, and he gave me a great portion of his original manuscript of his <span class="t8">Lives of the Poets</span>, which he had preserved for me.</p>
<p class="p24">I found on visiting his friend, Mr. Thrale, that he was now very ill, and had removed, I suppose by the solicitation of Mrs. Thrale, to a house in Grosvenor-square. I was sorry to see him sadly changed in his appearance.</p>
<p class="p24">He told me I might now have the pleasure to see Dr. Johnson drink wine again, for he had lately returned to it. When I mentioned this to Johnson, he said, &lsquo;I drink it now sometimes, but not socially.&rsquo; The first evening that I was with him at Thrale&rsquo;s, I observed he poured a large quantity of it into a glass, and swallowed it greedily. Every thing about his character and manners was forcible and violent; there never was any moderation; many a day did he fast, many a year did he refrain from wine; but when he did eat, it was voraciously; when he did drink wine, it was copiously. He could practise abstinence, but not temperance.</p>
<p class="p24">Mrs. Thrale and I had a dispute, whether Shakspeare or Milton had drawn the most admirable picture of a man. I was for Shakspeare; Mrs. Thrale for Milton; and after a fair hearing, Johnson decided for my opinion.</p>
<p class="p24">I told him of one of Mr. Burke&rsquo;s playful sallies upon Dean Marlay: &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t like the Deanery of <span class="t8">Ferns</span>, it sounds so like a <span class="t8">barren</span> title.&rsquo;&mdash; &lsquo;Dr. Heath should have it;&rsquo; said I. Johnson laughed, and condescending to trifle in the same mode of conceit, suggested Dr. <span class="t8">Moss</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">He said, &lsquo;Mrs. Montagu has dropt me. Now, Sir, there are people whom one should like very well to drop, but would not wish to be dropped by.&rsquo; He certainly was vain of the society of ladies, and could make himself very agreeable to them, when he chose it; Sir Joshua Reynolds agreed with me that he could. Mr. Gibbon, with his usual sneer, controverted it, perhaps in resentment of Johnson&rsquo;s having talked with some disgust of his ugliness, which one would think a <span class="t8">philosopher</span> would not mind. Dean Marlay wittily observed, &lsquo;A lady may be vain, when she can turn a wolf-dog into a lap-dog.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">The election for Ayrshire, my own county, was this spring tried upon a petition, before a Committee of the House of Commons. I was one of the Counsel for the sitting member, and took the liberty of previously stating different points to Johnson, who never failed to see them clearly, and to supply me with some good hints. He dictated to me the following note upon the registration of deeds: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;All laws are made for the convenience of the community: what is legally done, should be legally recorded, that the state of things may be known, and that wherever evidence is requisite, evidence may be had. For this reason, the obligation to frame and establish a legal register is enforced by a legal penalty, which penalty is the want of that perfection and plentitude of right which a register would give. Thence it follows, that this is not an objection merely legal: for the reason on which the law stands being equitable, makes it an equitable objection.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;This (said he) you must enlarge on, when speaking to the Committee. You must not argue there as if you were arguing in the schools; close reasoning will not fix their attention; you must say the same thing over and over again, in different words. If you say it but once, they miss it in a moment of inattention. It is unjust, Sir, to censure lawyers for multiplying words when they argue; it is often necessary for them to multiply words.&rsquo; His notion of the duty of a member of Parliament, sitting upon an election-committee, was very high; and when he was told of a gentleman upon one of those committees, who read the newspapers part of the time, and slept the rest, while the merits of a vote were examined by the counsel; and as an excuse, when challenged by the chairman for such behaviour, bluntly answered, &lsquo;I had made up my mind upon that case;&rsquo; &mdash; Johnson, with an indignant contempt, said, &lsquo;If he was such a rogue as to make up his mind upon a case without hearing it, he should not have been such a fool as to tell it.&rsquo; &lsquo;I think (said Mr. Dudley Long, now North) the Doctor has pretty plainly made him out to be both rogue and fool.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson&rsquo;s profound reverence for the Hierarchy made him expect from bishops the highest degree of decorum; he was offended even at their going to taverns; &lsquo;A bishop (said he) has nothing to do at a tippling-house. It is not indeed immoral in him to go to a tavern; neither would it be immoral in him to whip a top in Grosvenor-square. But, if he did, I hope the boys would fall upon him, and apply the whip to <span class="t8">him</span>. There are gradations in conduct; there is morality, &mdash; decency, &mdash; propriety. None of these should be violated by a bishop. A bishop should not go to a house where he may meet a young fellow leading out a wench.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;But, Sir, every tavern does not admit women.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Depend upon it, Sir, any tavern will admit a well-drest man and a well-drest woman; they will not perhaps admit a woman whom they see every night walking by their door, in the street. But a well-drest man may lead in a well-drest woman to any tavern in London. Taverns sell meat and drink, and will sell them to any body who can eat and can drink. You may as well say that a mercer will not sell silks to a woman of the town.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He also disapproved of bishops going to routs, at least of their staying at them longer than their presence commanded respect. He mentioned a particular bishop. &lsquo;Poh! (said Mrs. Thrale) the Bishop of &mdash;&mdash; is never minded at a rout.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;When a bishop places himself in a situation where he has no distinct character, and is of no consequence, he degrades the dignity of his order.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Mr. Boswell, Madam, has said it as correctly as it could be.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Nor was it only in the dignitaries of the Church that Johnson required a particular decorum and delicacy of behaviour; he justly considered that the clergy, as persons set apart for the sacred office of serving at the altar, and impressing the minds of men with the aweful concerns of a future state, should be somewhat more serious than the generality of mankind, and have a suitable composure of manners. A due sense of the dignity of their profession, independent of higher motives, will ever prevent them from losing their distinction in an indiscriminate sociality; and did such as affect this, know how much it lessens them in the eyes of those whom they think to please by it, they would feel themselves much mortified.</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson and his friend, Beauclerk, were once together in company with several clergymen, who thought that they should appear to advantage, by assuming the lax jollity of <span class="t8">men of the world;</span> which, as it may be observed in similar cases, they carried to noisy excess. Johnson, who they expected would be <span class="t8">entertained,</span> sat grave and silent for some time; at last, turning to Beauclerk, he said, by no means in a whisper, &lsquo;This merriment of parsons is mighty offensive.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Even the dress of a clergyman should be in character, and nothing can be more despicable than conceited attempts at avoiding the appearance of the clerical order; attempts, which are as ineffectual as they are pitiful. Dr. Porteus, now Bishop of London, in his excellent charge when presiding over the diocese of Chester, justly animadverts upon this subject; and observes of a reverend fop, that he &lsquo;can be but <span class="t8">half a beau</span>.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Addison, in <span class="t8">The Spectator</span>, has given us a fine portrait of a clergyman, who is supposed to be a member of his <span class="t8">Club</span>; and Johnson has exhibited a model, in the character of Mr. Mudge, which has escaped the collectors of his works, but which he owned to me, and which indeed he shewed to Sir Joshua Reynolds at the time when it was written. It bears the genuine marks of Johnson&rsquo;s best manner, and is as follows: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The Reverend Mr. <span class="t8">Zacariah Mudge</span>, Prebendary of Exeter, and Vicar of St. Andrew&rsquo;s in Plymouth; a man equally eminent for his virtues and abilities, and at once beloved as a companion and reverenced as a pastor. He had that general curiosity to which no kind of knowledge is indifferent or superfluous; and that general benevolence by which no order of men is hated or despised.</p>
<p class="p24">His principles both of thought and action were great and comprehensive. By a solicitous examination of objections, and judicious comparison of opposite arguments, he attained what enquiry never gives but to industry and perspicuity, a firm and unshaken settlement of conviction. But his firmness was without asperity; for, knowing with how much difficulty truth was sometimes found, he did not wonder that many missed it.</p>
<p class="p24">The general course of his life was determined by his profession; he studied the sacred volumes in the original languages; with what diligence and success, his <span class="t8">Notes upon the Psalms</span> give sufficient evidence. He once endeavoured to add the knowledge of Arabick to that of Hebrew; but finding his thoughts too much diverted from other studies, after some time desisted from his purpose.</p>
<p class="p24">His discharge of parochial duties was exemplary. How his <span class="t8">Sermons</span> were composed, may be learned from the excellent volume which he has given to the publick; but how they were delivered, can be known only to those that heard them; for as he appeared in the pulpit, words will not easily describe him. His delivery, though unconstrained was not negligent, and though forcible was not turbulent; disdaining anxious nicety of emphasis, and laboured artifice of action, it captivated the hearer by its natural dignity, it roused the sluggish, and fixed the volatile, and detained the mind upon the subject, without directing it to the speaker.</p>
<p class="p24">The grandeur and solemnity of the preacher did not intrude upon his general behaviour; at the table of his friends he was a companion communicative and attentive, of unaffected manners, of manly cheerfulness, willing to please, and easy to be pleased. His acquaintance was universally solicited, and his presence obstructed no enjoyment which religion did not forbid. Though studious he was popular; though argumentative he was modest; though inflexible he was candid; and though metaphysical yet orthodox.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Friday, March 30, I dined with him at Sir Joshua Reynolds&rsquo;s, with the Earl of Charlemont, Sir Annesley Stewart, Mr. Eliot of Port-Eliot, Mr. Burke, Dean Marlay, Mr. Langton; a most agreeable day, of which I regret that every circumstance is not preserved; but it is unreasonable to require such a multiplication of felicity.</p>
<p class="p24">Mr. Eliot, with whom Dr. Walter Harte had travelled, talked to us of his <span class="t8">History of Gustavus Adolphus</span>, which he said was a very good book in the German translation. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Harte was excessively vain. He put copies of his book in manuscript into the hands of Lord Chesterfield and Lord Granville, that they might revise it. Now how absurd was it to suppose that two such noblemen would revise so big a manuscript. Poor man! he left London the day of the publication of his book, that he might be out of the way of the great praise he was to receive; and he was ashamed to return, when he found how ill his book had succeeded. It was unlucky in coming out on the same day with Robertson&rsquo;s <span class="t8">History of Scotland</span>. His husbandry, however, is good.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;So he was fitter for that than for heroick history: he did well, when he turned his sword into a plough-share.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Mr. Eliot mentioned a curious liquor peculiar to his country, which the Cornish fishermen drink. They call it <span class="t8">Mahogany</span>; and it is made of two parts gin, and one part treacle, well beaten together. I begged to have some of it made, which was done with proper skill by Mr. Eliot. I thought it very good liquor; and said it was a counterpart of what is called <span class="t8">Athol Porridge</span> in the Highlands of Scotland, which is a mixture of whisky and honey. Johnson said, &lsquo;that must be a better liquor than the Cornish, for both its component parts are better.&rsquo; He also observed, &lsquo;<span class="t8">Mahogany</span> must be a modern name; for it is not long since the wood called mahogany was known in this country.&rsquo; I mentioned his scale of liquors; &mdash; claret for boys &mdash; port for men &mdash; brandy for heroes. &lsquo;Then (said Mr. Burke) let me have claret: I love to be a boy; to have the careless gaiety of boyish days.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;I should drink claret too, if it would give me that; but it does not: it neither makes boys men, nor men boys. You&rsquo;ll be drowned by it, before it has any effect upon you.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I ventured to mention a ludicrous paragraph in the newspapers, that Dr. Johnson was learning to dance of Vestris. Lord Charlemont, wishing to excite him to talk, proposed in a whisper, that he should be asked, whether it was true. &lsquo;Shall I ask him?&rsquo; said his Lordship. We were, by a great majority, clear for the experiment. Upon which his Lordship very gravely, and with a courteous air said, &lsquo;Pray, Sir, is it true that you are taking lessons of Vestris?&rsquo; This was risking a good deal, and required the boldness of a General of Irish Volunteers to make the attempt. Johnson was at first startled, and in some heat answered, &lsquo;How can your Lordship ask so simple a question?&rsquo; But immediately recovering himself, whether from unwillingness to be deceived, or to appear deceived, or whether from real good humour, he kept up the joke: &lsquo;Nay, but if any body were to answer the paragraph, and contradict it, I&rsquo;d have a reply, and would say, that he who contradicted it was no friend either to Vestris or me. For why should not Dr. Johnson add to his other powers a little corporeal agility? Socrates learnt to dance at an advanced age, and Cato learnt Greek at an advanced age. Then it might proceed to say, that this Johnson, not content with dancing on the ground, might dance on the rope; and they might introduce the elephant dancing on the rope. A nobleman wrote a play, called <span class="t8">Love in a hollow Tree</span>. He found out that it was a bad one, and therefore wished to buy up all the copies, and burn them. The Duchess of Marlborough had kept one; and when he was against her at an election, she had a new edition of it printed, and prefixed to it, as a frontispiece, an elephant dancing on a rope; to shew, that his Lordship&rsquo;s writing comedy was as aukward as an elephant dancing on a rope.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Sunday, April 1, I dined with him at Mr. Thrale&rsquo;s, with Sir Philip Jennings Clerk and Mr. Perkins, who had the superintendence of Mr. Thrale&rsquo;s brewery, with a salary of five hundred pounds a year. Sir Philip had the appearance of a gentleman of ancient family, well advanced in life. He wore his own white hair in a bag of goodly size, a black velvet coat, with an embroidered waistcoat, and very rich laced ruffles; which Mrs. Thrale said were old fashioned, but which, for that reason, I thought the more respectable, more like a Tory; yet Sir Philip was then in Opposition in Parliament. &lsquo;Ah, Sir, (said Johnson,) ancient ruffles and modern principles do not agree.&rsquo; Sir Philip defended the Opposition to the American war ably and with temper, and I joined him. He said, the majority of the nation was against the ministry. JOHNSON. &lsquo;<span class="t8">I</span>, Sir, am against the ministry; but it is for having too little of that, of which Opposition thinks they have too much. Were I minister, if any man wagged his finger against me, he should be turned out; for that which it is in the power of Government to give at pleasure to one or to another, should be given to the supporters of Government. If you will not oppose at the expence of losing your place, your opposition will not be honest, you will feel no serious grievance; and the present opposition is only a contest to get what others have. Sir Robert Walpole acted as I would do. As to the American war, the <span class="t8">sense</span> of the nation is <span class="t8">with</span> the ministry. The majority of those who can <span class="t8">understand</span> is with it; the majority of those who can only <span class="t8">hear</span>, is against it; and as those who can only hear are more numerous than those who can understand, and Opposition is always loudest, a majority of the rabble will be for Opposition.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">This boisterous vivacity entertained us; but the truth in my opinion was, that those who could understand the best were against the American war, as almost every man now is, when the question has been coolly considered.</p>
<p class="p24">Mrs. Thrale gave high praise to Mr. Dudley Long, (now North). JOHNSON. &lsquo;Nay, my dear lady, don&rsquo;t talk so. Mr. Long&rsquo;s character is very <span class="t8">short</span>. It is nothing. He fills a chair. He is a man of genteel appearance, and that is all. I know nobody who blasts by praise as you do: for whenever there is exaggerated praise, every body is set against a character. They are provoked to attack it. Now there is Pepys; you praised that man with such disproportion, that I was incited to lessen him, perhaps more than he deserves. His blood is upon your head. By the same principle, your malice defeats itself; for your censure is too violent. And yet (looking to her with a leering smile) she is the first woman in the world, could she but restrain that wicked tongue of hers; &mdash; she would be the only woman, could she but command that little whirligig.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Upon the subject of exaggerated praise I took the liberty to say, that I thought there might be very high praise given to a known character which deserved it, and therefore it would not be exaggerated. Thus, one might say of Mr. Edmund Burke, He is a very wonderful man. JOHNSON. &lsquo;No, Sir, you would not be safe if another man had a mind perversely to contradict. He might answer, &ldquo;Where is all the wonder? Burke is, to be sure, a man of uncommon abilities, with a great quantity of matter in his mind, and a great fluency of language in his mouth. But we are not to be stunned and astonished by him.&rdquo; So you see, Sir, even Burke would suffer, not from any fault of his own, but from your folly.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Mrs. Thrale mentioned a gentleman who had acquired a fortune of four thousand a year in trade, but was absolutely miserable, because he could not talk in company; so miserable, that he was impelled to lament his situation in the street to &mdash;&mdash; , whom he hates, and who he knows despises him. &lsquo;I am a most unhappy man (said he). I am invited to conversations. I go to conversations; but, alas! I have no conversation.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Man commonly cannot be successful in different ways. This gentleman has spent, in getting four thousand pounds a year, the time in which he might have learnt to talk; and now he cannot talk.&rsquo; Mr. Perkins made a shrewd and droll remark: &lsquo;If he had got his four thousand a year as a mountebank, he might have learnt to talk at the same time that he was getting his fortune.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Some other gentlemen came in. The conversation concerning the person whose character Dr. Johnson had treated so slightingly, as he did not know his merit, was resumed. Mrs. Thrale said, &lsquo;You think so of him, Sir, because he is quiet, and does not exert himself with force. You&rsquo;ll be saying the same thing of Mr. &mdash;&mdash; there, who sits as quiet &mdash; .&rsquo; This was not well-bred; and Johnson did not let it pass without correction. &lsquo;Nay, Madam, what right have you to talk thus? Both Mr. &mdash;&mdash; and I have reason to take it ill. <span class="t8">You</span> may talk so of Mr. &mdash;&mdash; ; but why do you make <span class="t8">me</span> do it. Have I said anything against Mr. &mdash;&mdash; ? You have <span class="t8">set</span> him, that I might shoot him: but I have not shot him.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">One of the gentlemen said, he had seen three folio volumes of Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s sayings collected by me. &lsquo;I must put you right, Sir, (said I;) for I am very exact in authenticity. You could not see folio volumes, for I have none: you might have seen some in quarto and octavo. This is inattention which one should guard against.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, it is a want of concern about veracity. He does not know that he saw <span class="t8">any</span> volumes. If he had seen them he could have remembered their size.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Mr. Thrale appeared very lethargick to-day. I saw him again on Monday evening, at which time he was not thought to be in immediate danger; but early in the morning of Wednesday, the 4th, he expired. Johnson was in the house, and thus mentions the event: &lsquo;I felt almost the last flutter of his pulse, and looked for the last time upon the face that for fifteen years had never been turned upon me but with respect and benignity.&rsquo; Upon that day there was a Call of the LITERARY CLUB; but Johnson apologised for his absence by the following note: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;MR. JOHNSON knows that Sir Joshua Reynolds and the other gentlemen will excuse his incompliance with the call, when they are told that Mr. Thrale died this morning.&rsquo; Wednesday.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Mr. Thrale&rsquo;s death was a very essential loss to Johnson, who, although he did not foresee all that afterwards happened, was sufficiently convinced that the comforts which Mr. Thrale&rsquo;s family afforded him, would now in a great measure cease. He, however continued to shew a kind attention to his widow and children as long as it was acceptable; and he took upon him, with a very earnest concern, the office of one of his executors, the importance of which seemed greater than usual to him, from his circumstances having been always such, that he had scarcely any share in the real business of life. His friends of the CLUB were in hopes that Mr. Thrale might have made a liberal provision for him for his life, which, as Mr. Thrale left no son, and a very large fortune, it would have been highly to his honour to have done; and, considering Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s age, could not have been of long duration; but he bequeathed him only two hundred pounds, which was the legacy given to each of his executors. I could not but be somewhat diverted by hearing Johnson talk in a pompous manner of his new office, and particularly of the concerns of the brewery, which it was at last resolved should be sold. Lord Lucan tells a very good story, which, if not precisely exact, is certainly characteristic: that when the sale of Thrale&rsquo;s brewery was going forward, Johnson appeared bustling about, with an ink-horn and pen in his button-hole, like an excise-man; and on being asked what he really considered to be the value of the property which was to be disposed of, answered, &lsquo;We are not here to sell a parcel of boilers and vats but the potentiality of growing rich, beyond the dreams of avarice.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Friday, April 6, he carried me to dine at a club, which, at his desire, had been lately formed at the Queen&rsquo;s Arms, in St. Paul&rsquo;s Church-yard. He told Mr. Hoole, that he wished to have a <span class="t8">City Club</span>, and asked him to collect one; but, said he, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t let them be <span class="t8">patriots</span>.&rsquo; The company were to-day very sensible, well-behaved men. I have preserved only two particulars of his conversation. He said he was glad Lord George Gordon had escaped, rather than that a precedent should be established for hanging a man for <span class="t8">constructive treason</span>; which, in consistency with his true, manly, constitutional Toryism, he considered would be a dangerous engine of arbitrary power. And upon its being mentioned that an opulent and very indolent Scotch nobleman, who totally resigned the management of his affairs to a man of knowledge and abilities, had claimed some merit by saying, &lsquo;The next best thing to managing a man&rsquo;s own affairs well is being sensible of incapacity, and not attempting it, but having full confidence in one who can do it:&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Nay, Sir, this is paltry. There is a middle course. Let a man give application; and depend upon it he will soon get above a despicable state of helplessness, and attain the power of acting for himself.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Saturday, April 7, I dined with him at Mr. Hoole&rsquo;s with Governour Bouchier and Captain Orme, both of whom had been long in the East-Indies; and being men of good sense and observation, were very entertaining. Johnson defended the oriental regulation of different <span class="t8">casts</span> of men, which was objected to as totally destructive of the hopes of rising in society by personal merit. He shewed that there was a <span class="t8">principle</span> in it sufficiently plausible by analogy. &lsquo;We see (said he) in metals that there are different species; and so likewise in animals, though one species may not differ very widely from another, as in the species of dogs, &mdash; the cur, the spaniel, the mastiff. The Bramins are the mastiffs of mankind.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Thursday, April 12, I dined with him at a Bishop&rsquo;s, where were Sir Joshua Reynolds, Mr. Berrenger, and some more company. He had dined the day before at another Bishop&rsquo;s. I have unfortunately recorded none of his conversation at the Bishop&rsquo;s where we dined together: but I have preserved his ingenious defence of his dining twice abroad in Passion-week; a laxity, in which I am convinced he would not have indulged himself at the time when he wrote his solemn paper in <span class="t8">The Rambler</span>, upon that aweful season. It appeared to me, that by being much more in company, and enjoying more luxurious living, he had contracted a keener relish of pleasure, and was consequently less rigorous in his religious rites. This he would not acknowledge; but he reasoned with admirable sophistry, as follows: &lsquo;Why, Sir, a Bishop&rsquo;s calling company together in this week is, to use the vulgar phrase, not <span class="t8">the thing</span>. But you must consider laxity is a bad thing; but preciseness is also a bad thing; and your general character may be more hurt by preciseness than by dining with a Bishop in Passion-week. There might be a handle for reflection. It might be said, &lsquo;He refused to dine with a Bishop in Passion-week, but was three Sundays absent from Church.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Very true, Sir. But suppose a man to be uniformly of good conduct, would it not be better that he should refuse to dine with a Bishop in this week, and so not encourage a bad practice by his example?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, you are to consider whether you might not do more harm by lessening the influence of a Bishop&rsquo;s character by your disapprobation in refusing him, than by going to him.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">TO MRS. LUCY PORTER, IN LICHFIELD.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;DEAR MADAM,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Life is full of troubles. I have just lost my dear friend Thrale. I hope he is happy; but I have had a great loss. I am otherwise pretty well. I require some care of myself, but that care is not ineffectual; and when I am out of order, I think it often my own fault.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The spring is now making quick advances. As it is the season in which the whole world is enlivened and invigorated, I hope that both you and I shall partake of its benefits. My desire is to see Lichfield; but being left executor to my friend, I know not whether I can be spared; but I will try, for it is now long since we saw one another, and how little we can promise ourselves many more interviews, we are taught by hourly examples of mortality. Let us try to live so as that mortality may not be an evil. Write to me soon, my dearest; your letters will give me great pleasure.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am sorry that Mr. Porter has not had his box; but by sending it to Mr. Mathias, who very readily undertook its conveyance, I did the best I could, and perhaps before now he has it.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Be so kind as to make my compliments to my friends; I have a great value for their kindness, and hope to enjoy it before summer is past. Do write to me. I am, dearest love,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your most humble servant,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;London, April 12, 1781.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Friday, April 13, being Good-Friday, I went to St. Clement&rsquo;s church with him as usual. There I saw again his old fellow-collegian, Edwards, to whom I said, &lsquo;I think, Sir, Dr. Johnson and you meet only at Church.&rsquo;&mdash; &lsquo;Sir, (said he,) it is the best place we can meet in, except Heaven, and I hope we shall meet there too.&rsquo; Dr. Johnson told me, that there was very little communication between Edwards and him, after their unexpected renewal of acquaintance. &lsquo;But (said he, smiling) he met me once, and said, &ldquo;I am told you have written a very pretty book called <span class="t8">The Rambler</span>.&rdquo; I was unwilling that he should leave the world in total darkness, and sent him a set.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Mr. Berrenger visited him to-day, and was very pleasing. We talked of an evening society for conversation at a house in town, of which we were all members, but of which Johnson said, &lsquo;It will never do, Sir. There is nothing served about there, neither tea, nor coffee, nor lemonade, nor any thing whatever; and depend upon it, Sir, a man does not love to go to a place from whence he comes out exactly as he went in.&rsquo; I endeavoured, for argument&rsquo;s sake, to maintain that men of learning and talents might have very good intellectual society, without the aid of any little gratifications of the senses. Berrenger joined with Johnson, and said, that without these any meeting would be dull and insipid. He would therefore have all the slight refreshments; nay, it would not be amiss to have some cold meat, and a bottle of wine upon a side-board. &lsquo;Sir, (said Johnson to me, with an air of triumph,) Mr. Berrenger knows the world. Every body loves to have good things furnished to them without any trouble. I told Mrs. Thrale once, that as she did not choose to have card tables, she should have a profusion of the best sweetmeats, and she would be sure to have company enough come to her.&rsquo; I agreed with my illustrious friend upon this subject; for it has pleased GOD to make man a composite animal, and where there is nothing to refresh the body, the mind will languish.</p>
<p class="p24">On Sunday, April 15, being Easter-day, after solemn worship in St. Paul&rsquo;s church, I found him alone; Dr. Scott of the Commons came in. He talked of its having been said that Addison wrote some of his best papers in <span class="t8">The Spectator</span> when warm with wine. Dr. Johnson did not seem willing to admit this. Dr. Scott, as a confirmation of it, related, that Blackstone, a sober man, composed his <span class="t8">Commentaries</span> with a bottle of port before him; and found his mind invigorated and supported in the fatigue of his great work, by a temperate use of it.</p>
<p class="p24">I told him, that in a company where I had lately been, a desire was expressed to know his authority for the shocking story of Addison&rsquo;s sending an execution into Steele&rsquo;s house. &lsquo;Sir, (said he,) it is generally known, it is known to all who are acquainted with the literary history of that period. It is as well known, as that he wrote <span class="t8">Cato</span>.&rsquo; Mr. Thomas Sheridan once defended Addison to me, by alledging that he did it in order to cover Steele&rsquo;s goods from other creditors, who were going to seize them.</p>
<p class="p24">We talked of the difference between the mode of education at Oxford, and that in those Colleges where instruction is chiefly conveyed by lectures. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Lectures were once useful; but now, when all can read, and books are so numerous, lectures are unnecessary. If your attention fails, and you miss a part of a lecture, it is lost; you cannot go back as you do upon a book.&rsquo; Dr. Scott agreed with him. &lsquo;But yet (said I), Dr. Scott, you yourself gave lectures at Oxford.&rsquo; He smiled. &lsquo;You laughed (then said I) at those who came to you.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Dr. Scott left us, and soon afterwards we went to dinner. Our company consisted of Mrs. Williams, Mrs. Desmoulins, Mr. Levett, Mr. Allen, the printer, and Mrs. Hall, sister of the Reverend Mr. John Wesley, and resembling him, as I thought, both in figure and manner. Johnson produced now, for the first time, some handsome silver salvers, which he told me he had bought fourteen years ago; so it was a great day. I was not a little amused by observing Allen perpetually struggling to talk in the manner of Johnson, like the little frog in the fable blowing himself up to resemble the stately ox.</p>
<p class="p24">I mentioned a kind of religious Robinhood Society, which met every Sunday evening, at Coachmakers&rsquo;-hall, for free debate; and that the subject for this night was, the text which relates, with other miracles, which happened at our SAVIOUR&rsquo;S death, &lsquo;And the graves were opened, and many bodies of the saints which slept arose, and came out of the graves after his resurrection, and went into the holy city, and appeared unto many.&rsquo; Mrs. Hall said it was a very curious subject, and she should like to hear it discussed. JOHNSON, (somewhat warmly) &lsquo;One would not go to such a place to hear it, &mdash; one would not be seen in such a place &mdash; to give countenance to such a meeting.&rsquo; I, however, resolved that I would go. &lsquo;But, Sir, (said she to Johnson,) I should like to hear <span class="t8">you</span> discuss it.&rsquo; He seemed reluctant to engage in it. She talked of the resurrection of the human race in general, and maintained that we shall be raised with the same bodies. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Nay, Madam, we see that it is not to be the same body; for the Scripture uses the illustration of grain sown, and we know that the grain which grows is not the same with what is sown. You cannot suppose that we shall rise with a diseased body; it is enough if there be such a sameness as to distinguish identity of person.&rsquo; She seemed desirous of knowing more, but he left the question in obscurity.</p>
<p class="p24">Of apparitions, he observed, &lsquo;A total disbelief of them is adverse to the opinion of the existence of the soul between death and the last day; the question simply is, whether departed spirits ever have the power of making themselves perceptible to us; a man who thinks he has seen an apparition, can only be convinced himself; his authority will not convince another, and his conviction, if rational, must be founded on being told something which cannot be known but by supernatural means.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He mentioned a thing as not unfrequent, of which I had never heard before, &mdash; being <span class="t8">called</span>, that is, hearing one&rsquo;s name pronounced by the voice of a known person at a great distance, far beyond the possibility of being reached by any sound uttered by human organs. &lsquo;An acquaintance, on whose veracity I can depend, told me, that walking home one evening to Kilmarnock, he heard himself called from a wood, by the voice of a brother who had gone to America; and the next packet brought accounts of that brother&rsquo;s death.&rsquo; Macbean asserted that this inexplicable <span class="t8">calling</span> was a thing very well known. Dr. Johnson said, that one day at Oxford, as he was turning the key of his chamber, he heard his mother distinctly call Sam. She was then at Lichfield; but nothing ensued. This phaenomenon is, I think, as wonderful as any other mysterious fact, which many people are very slow to believe, or rather, indeed, reject with an obstinate contempt.</p>
<p class="p24">Some time after this, upon his making a remark which escaped my attention, Mrs. Williams and Mrs. Hall were both together striving to answer him. He grew angry, and called out loudly, &lsquo;Nay, when you both speak at once, it is intolerable.&rsquo; But checking himself, and softening, he said, &lsquo;This one may say, though you <span class="t8">are</span> ladies.&rsquo; Then he brightened into gay humour, and addressed them in the words of one of the songs in <span class="t8">The Beggar&rsquo;s Opera</span>: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;But two at a time there&rsquo;s no mortal can bear.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;What, Sir, (said I,) are you going to turn Captain Macheath?&rsquo; There was something as pleasantly ludicrous in this scene as can be imagined. The contrast between Macheath, Polly, and Lucy &mdash; and Dr. Samuel Johnson, blind, peevish Mrs. Williams, and lean, lank, preaching Mrs. Hall, was exquisite.</p>
<p class="p24">I stole away to Coachmakers&rsquo;-hall, and heard the difficult text of which we had talked, discussed with great decency, and some intelligence, by several speakers. There was a difference of opinion as to the appearance of ghosts in modern times, though the arguments for it, supported by Mr. Addison&rsquo;s authority, preponderated. The immediate subject of debate was embarrassed by the <span class="t8">bodies</span> of the saints having been said to rise, and by the question what became of them afterwards; did they return again to their graves? or were they translated to heaven? Only one evangelist mentions the fact, and the commentators whom I have looked at, do not make the passage clear. There is, however, no occasion for our understanding it farther, than to know that it was one of the extraordinary manifestations of divine power, which accompanied the most important event that ever happened.</p>
<p class="p24">On Friday, April 20, I spent with him one of the happiest days that I remember to have enjoyed in the whole course of my life. Mrs. Garrick, whose grief for the loss of her husband was, I believe, as sincere as wounded affection and admiration could produce, had this day, for the first time since his death, a select party of his friends to dine with her. The company was Miss Hannah More, who lived with her, and whom she called her Chaplain; Mrs. Boscawen, Mrs. Elizabeth Carter, Sir Joshua Reynolds, Dr. Burney, Dr. Johnson, and myself. We found ourselves very elegantly entertained at her house in the Adelphi, where I have passed many a pleasing hour with him &lsquo;who gladdened life.&rsquo; She looked well, talked of her husband with complacency, and while she cast her eyes on his portrait, which hung over the chimney-piece, said, that &lsquo;death was now the most agreeable object to her.&rsquo; The very semblance of David Garrick was cheering. Mr. Beauclerk, with happy propriety, inscribed under that fine portrait of him, which by Lady Diana&rsquo;s kindness is now the property of my friend Mr. Langton, the following passage from his beloved Shakspeare: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;A merrier man,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within the limit of becoming mirth,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I never spent an hour&rsquo;s talk withal.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His eye begets occasion for his wit;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For every object that the one doth catch,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other turns to a mirth-moving jest;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which his fair tongue (Conceit&rsquo;s expositor)</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Delivers in such apt and gracious words,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That aged ears play truant at his tales,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And younger hearings are quite ravished:</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So sweet and voluble is his discourse316.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">We were all in fine spirits; and I whispered to Mrs. Boscawen, &lsquo;I believe this is as much as can be made of life.&rsquo; In addition to a splendid entertainment, we were regaled with Lichfield ale, which had a peculiar appropriated value. Sir Joshua, and Dr. Burney, and I, drank cordially of it to Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s health; and though he would not join us, he as cordially answered, &lsquo;Gentlemen, I wish you all as well as you do me.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">The general effect of this day dwells upon my mind in fond remembrance; but I do not find much conversation recorded. What I have preserved shall be faithfully given.</p>
<p class="p24">One of the company mentioned Mr. Thomas Hollis, the strenuous Whig, who used to send over Europe presents of democratical books, with their boards stamped with daggers and caps of liberty. Mrs. Carter said, &lsquo;He was a bad man. He used to talk uncharitably.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Poh! poh! Madam; who is the worse for being talked of uncharitably? Besides, he was a dull poor creature as ever lived: And I believe he would not have done harm to a man whom he knew to be of very opposite principles to his own. I remember once at the Society of Arts, when an advertisement was to be drawn up, he pointed me out as the man who could do it best. This, you will observe, was kindness to me. I however slipt away, and escaped it.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Mrs. Carter having said of the same person, &lsquo;I doubt he was an Atheist.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know that. He might perhaps have become one, if he had had time to ripen, (smiling.) He might have <span class="t8">exuberated</span> into an Atheist.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Sir Joshua Reynolds praised <span class="t8">Mudge&rsquo;s Sermons</span>. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Mudge&rsquo;s Sermons are good, but not practical. He grasps more sense than he can hold; he takes more corn than he can make into meal; he opens a wide prospect, but it is so distant, it is indistinct. I love <span class="t8">Blair&rsquo;s Sermons</span>. Though the dog is a Scotchman, and a Presbyterian, and every thing he should not be, I was the first to praise them. Such was my candour.&rsquo; (smiling.) MRS. BOSCAWEN. &lsquo;Such his great merit to get the better of all your prejudices.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Madam, let us compound the matter; let us ascribe it to my candour, and his merit.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">In the evening we had a large company in the drawing-room, several ladies, the Bishop of Killaloe, Dr. Percy, Mr. Chamberlayne, of the Treasury, &amp;c. &amp;c. Somebody said the life of a mere literary man could not be very entertaining. JOHNSON. &lsquo;But it certainly may. This is a remark which has been made, and repeated, without justice; why should the life of a literary man be less entertaining than the life of any other man? Are there not as interesting varieties in such a life? As <span class="t8">a literary life</span> it may be very entertaining.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;But it must be better surely, when it is diversified with a little active variety &mdash; such as his having gone to Jamaica; or &mdash; his having gone to the Hebrides.&rsquo; Johnson was not displeased at this.</p>
<p class="p24">Talking of a very respectable authour, he told us a curious circumstance in his life, which was, that he had married a printer&rsquo;s devil. REYNOLDS. &lsquo;A printer&rsquo;s devil, Sir! Why, I thought a printer&rsquo;s devil was a creature with a black face and in rags.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Yes, Sir. But I suppose, he had her face washed, and put clean clothes on her. (Then looking very serious, and very earnest.) And she did not disgrace him; the woman had a bottom of good sense. The word <span class="t8">bottom</span> thus introduced, was so ludicrous when contrasted with his gravity, that most of us could not forbear tittering and laughing; though I recollect that the Bishop of Killaloe kept his countenance with perfect steadiness, while Miss Hannah More slyly hid her face behind a lady&rsquo;s back who sat on the same settee with her. His pride could not bear that any expression of his should excite ridicule, when he did not intend it; he therefore resolved to assume and exercise despotick power, glanced sternly around, and called out in a strong tone, &lsquo;Where&rsquo;s the merriment?&rsquo; Then collecting himself, and looking aweful, to make us feel how he could impose restraint, and as it were searching his mind for a still more ludicrous word, he slowly pronounced, &lsquo;I say the <span class="t8">woman</span> was <span class="t8">fundamentally</span> sensible;&rsquo; as if he had said, hear this now, and laugh if you dare. We all sat composed as at a funeral.</p>
<p class="p24">He and I walked away together; we stopped a little while by the rails of the Adelphi, looking on the Thames, and I said to him with some emotion that I was now thinking of two friends we had lost, who once lived in the buildings behind us, Beauclerk and Garrick. &lsquo;Ay, Sir, (said he, tenderly) and two such friends as cannot be supplied.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">For some time after this day I did not see him very often, and of the conversation which I did enjoy, I am sorry to find I have preserved but little. I was at this time engaged in a variety of other matters, which required exertion and assiduity, and necessarily occupied almost all my time.</p>
<p class="p24">One day having spoken very freely of those who were then in power, he said to me, &lsquo;Between ourselves, Sir, I do not like to give opposition the satisfaction of knowing how much I disapprove of the ministry.&rsquo; And when I mentioned that Mr. Burke had boasted how quiet the nation was in George the Second&rsquo;s reign, when Whigs were in power, compared with the present reign, when Tories governed;&mdash; &lsquo;Why, Sir, (said he,) you are to consider that Tories having more reverence for government, will not oppose with the same violence as Whigs, who being unrestrained by that principle, will oppose by any means.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">This month he lost not only Mr. Thrale, but another friend, Mr. William Strahan, Junior, printer, the eldest son of his old and constant friend, Printer to his Majesty.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;TO MRS. STRAHAN.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;DEAR MADAM,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The grief which I feel for the loss of a very kind friend is sufficient to make me know how much you suffer by the death of an amiable son; a man, of whom I think it may truly be said, that no one knew him who does not lament him. I look upon myself as having a friend, another friend, taken from me.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Comfort, dear Madam, I would give you if I could, but I know how little the forms of consolation can avail. Let me, however, counsel you not to waste your health in unprofitable sorrow, but go to Bath, and endeavour to prolong your own life; but when we have all done all that we can, one friend must in time lose the other.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am, dear Madam,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your most humble servant,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;April 23, 1781.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Tuesday, May 8, I had the pleasure of again dining with him and Mr. Wilkes, at Mr. Billy&rsquo;s. No <span class="t8">negociation</span> was now required to bring them together; for Johnson was so well satisfied with the former interview, that he was very glad to meet Wilkes again, who was this day seated between Dr. Beattie and Dr. Johnson; (between <span class="t8">Truth</span> and <span class="t8">Reason</span>, as General Paoli said, when I told him of it.) WILKES. &lsquo;I have been thinking, Dr. Johnson, that there should be a bill brought into parliament that the controverted elections for Scotland should be tried in that country, at their own Abbey of Holy-Rood House, and not here; for the consequence of trying them here is, that we have an inundation of Scotchmen, who come up and never go back again. Now here is Boswell, who is come up upon the election for his own county, which will not last a fortnight.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Nay, Sir, I see no reason why they should be tried at all; for, you know, one Scotchman is as good as another.&rsquo; WILKES. &lsquo;Pray, Boswell, how much may be got in a year by an Advocate at the Scotch bar?&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;I believe two thousand pounds.&rsquo; WlLKES. &lsquo;How can it be possible to spend that money in Scotland?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, the money may be spent in England: but there is a harder question. If one man in Scotland gets possession of two thousand pounds, what remains for all the rest of the nation?&rsquo; WILKES. &lsquo;You know, in the last war, the immense booty which Thurot carried off by the complete plunder of seven Scotch isles; he re-embarked with <span class="t8">three and six-pence</span>.&rsquo; Here again Johnson and Wilkes joined in extravagant sportive raillery upon the supposed poverty of Scotland, which Dr. Beattie and I did not think it worth our while to dispute.</p>
<p class="p24">The subject of quotation being introduced, Mr. Wilkes censured it as pedantry. JOHNSON. &lsquo;No, Sir, it is a good thing; there is a community of mind in it. Classical quotation is the <span class="t8">parole</span> of literary men all over the world.&rsquo; WlLKES. &lsquo;Upon the continent they all quote the vulgate Bible. Shakspeare is chiefly quoted here; and we quote also Pope, Prior, Butler, Waller, and sometimes Cowley.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">We talked of Letter-writing. JOHNSON. &lsquo;It is now become so much the fashion to publish letters, that in order to avoid it, I put as little into mine as I can.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Do what you will, Sir, you cannot avoid it. Should you even write as ill as you can, your letters would be published as curiosities:</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Behold a miracle! instead of wit,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See two dull lines with Stanhope&rsquo;s pencil writ332.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He gave us an entertaining account of <span class="t8">Bet Flint</span>, a woman of the town, who, with some eccentrick talents and much effrontery, forced herself upon his acquaintance. &lsquo;Bet (said he) wrote her own Life in verse, which she brought to me, wishing that I would furnish her with a Preface to it. (Laughing.) I used to say of her that she was generally slut and drunkard; occasionally, whore and thief. She had, however, genteel lodgings, a spinnet on which she played, and a boy that walked before her chair. Poor Bet was taken up on a charge of stealing a counterpane, and tried at the Old Bailey. Chief Justice &mdash;&mdash;&nbsp; &mdash; , who loved a wench, summed up favourably, and she was acquitted. After which Bet said, with a gay and satisfied air, &lsquo;Now that the counterpane is <span class="t8">my own</span>, I shall make a petticoat of it.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Talking of oratory, Mr. Wilkes described it as accompanied with all the charms of poetical expression. JOHNSON. &lsquo;No, Sir; oratory is the power of beating down your adversary&rsquo;s arguments, and putting better in their place.&rsquo; WlLKES. &lsquo;But this does not move the passions.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;He must be a weak man, who is to be so moved.&rsquo; WlLKES. (naming a celebrated orator) &lsquo;Amidst all the brilliancy of &mdash; &mdash; &lsquo;s imagination, and the exuberance of his wit, there is a strange want of <span class="t8">taste</span>. It was observed of Apelles&rsquo;s Venus, that her flesh seemed as if she had been nourished by roses: his oratory would sometimes make one suspect that he eats potatoes and drinks whisky.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Mr. Wilkes observed, how tenacious we are of forms in this country, and gave as an instance, the vote of the House of Commons for remitting money to pay the army in America <span class="t8">in Portugal pieces</span>, when, in reality, the remittance is made not in Portugal money, but in our own specie. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Is there not a law, Sir, against exporting the current coin of the realm?&rsquo; WlLKES. &lsquo;Yes, Sir: but might not the House of Commons, in case of real evident necessity, order our own current coin to be sent into our own colonies?&rsquo; Here Johnson, with that quickness of recollection which distinguished him so eminently, gave the <span class="t8">Middlesex Patriot</span> an admirable retort upon his own ground. &lsquo;Sure, Sir, <span class="t8">you</span> don&rsquo;t think a <span class="t8">resolution of the House of Commons</span> equal to <span class="t8">the law of the land</span>.&rsquo; WlLKES. (at once perceiving the application) &lsquo;GOD forbid, Sir.&rsquo; To hear what had been treated with such violence in <span class="t8">The False Alarm</span>, now turned into pleasant repartee, was extremely agreeable. Johnson went on;&mdash; &lsquo;Locke observes well, that a prohibition to export the current coin is impolitick; for when the balance of trade happens to be against a state, the current coin must be exported.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Mr. Beauclerk&rsquo;s great library was this season sold in London by auction. Mr. Wilkes said, he wondered to find in it such a numerous collection of sermons; seeming to think it strange that a gentleman of Mr. Beauclerk&rsquo;s character in the gay world should have chosen to have many compositions of that kind. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, you are to consider, that sermons make a considerable branch of English literature; so that a library must be very imperfect if it has not a numerous collection of sermons: and in all collections, Sir, the desire of augmenting it grows stronger in proportion to the advance in acquisition; as motion is accelerated by the continuance of the <span class="t8">impetus</span>. Besides, Sir, (looking at Mr. Wilkes with a placid but significant smile) a man may collect sermons with intention of making himself better by them. I hope Mr. Beauclerk intended, that some time or other that should be the case with him.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Mr. Wilkes said to me, loud enough for Dr. Johnson to hear, &lsquo;Dr. Johnson should make me a present of his <span class="t8">Lives of the Poets</span>, as I am a poor patriot, who cannot afford to buy them.&rsquo; Johnson seemed to take no notice of this hint; but in a little while, he called to Mr. Dilly, &lsquo;Pray, Sir, be so good as to send a set of my <span class="t8">Lives</span> to Mr. Wilkes, with my compliments.&rsquo; This was accordingly done; and Mr. Wilkes paid Dr. Johnson a visit, was courteously received, and sat with him a long time.</p>
<p class="p24">The company gradually dropped away. Mr. Dilly himself was called down stairs upon business; I left the room for some time; when I returned, I was struck with observing Dr. Samuel Johnson and John Wilkes, Esq., literally <span class="t8">tête-à-tête</span>; for they were reclined upon their chairs, with their heads leaning almost close to each other, and talking earnestly, in a kind of confidential whisper, of the personal quarrel between George the Second and the King of Prussia. Such a scene of perfectly easy sociality between two such opponents in the war of political controversy, as that which I now beheld, would have been an excellent subject for a picture. It presented to my mind the happy days which are foretold in Scripture, when the lion shall lie down with the kid.</p>
<p class="p24">After this day there was another pretty long interval, during which Dr. Johnson and I did not meet. When I mentioned it to him with regret, he was pleased to say, &lsquo;Then, Sir, let us live double.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">About this time it was much the fashion for several ladies to have evening assemblies, where the fair sex might participate in conversation with literary and ingenious men, animated by a desire to please. These societies were denominated <span class="t8">Blue-stocking Clubs</span>, the origin of which title being little known, it may be worth while to relate it. One of the most eminent members of those societies, when they first commenced, was Mr. Stillingfleet, whose dress was remarkably grave, and in particular it was observed, that he wore blue stockings. Such was the excellence of his conversation, that his absence was felt as so great a loss, that it used to be said, &lsquo;We can do nothing without the <span class="t8">blue stockings</span>;&rsquo; and thus by degrees the title was established. Miss Hannah More has admirably described a <span class="t8">Blue-stocking Club</span>, in her <span class="t8">Bas Bleu</span>, a poem in which many of the persons who were most conspicuous there are mentioned.</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson was prevailed with to come sometimes into these circles, and did not think himself too grave even for the lively Miss Monckton (now Countess of Corke), who used to have the finest <span class="t8">bit of blue</span> at the house of her mother, Lady Galway. Her vivacity enchanted the Sage, and they used to talk together with all imaginable ease. A singular instance happened one evening, when she insisted that some of Sterne&rsquo;s writings were very pathetick. Johnson bluntly denied it. &lsquo;I am sure (said she) they have affected <span class="t8">me</span>.&rsquo; &lsquo;Why (said Johnson, smiling, and rolling himself about,) that is, because, dearest, you&rsquo;re a dunce.&rsquo; When she some time afterwards mentioned this to him, he said with equal truth and politeness; &lsquo;Madam, if I had thought so, I certainly should not have said it.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Another evening Johnson&rsquo;s kind indulgence towards me had a pretty difficult trial. I had dined at the Duke of Montrose&rsquo;s with a very agreeable party, and his Grace, according to his usual custom, had circulated the bottle very freely. Lord Graham and I went together to Miss Monckton&rsquo;s, where I certainly was in extraordinary spirits, and above all fear or awe. In the midst of a great number of persons of the first rank, amongst whom I recollect with confusion, a noble lady of the most stately decorum, I placed myself next to Johnson, and thinking myself now fully his match, talked to him in a loud and boisterous manner, desirous to let the company know how I could contend with <span class="t8">Ajax</span>. I particularly remember pressing him upon the value of the pleasures of the imagination, and as an illustration of my argument, asking him, &lsquo;What, Sir, supposing I were to fancy that the &mdash; (naming the most charming Duchess in his Majesty&rsquo;s dominions) were in love with me, should I not be very happy?&rsquo; My friend with much address evaded my interrogatories, and kept me as quiet as possible; but it may easily be conceived how he must have felt. However, when a few days afterwards I waited upon him and made an apology, he behaved with the most friendly gentleness.</p>
<p class="p24">While I remained in London this year, Johnson and I dined together at several places. I recollect a placid day at Dr. Butter&rsquo;s, who had now removed from Derby to Lower Grosvenor-street, London; but of his conversation on that and other occasions during this period, I neglected to keep any regular record, and shall therefore insert here some miscellaneous articles which I find in my Johnsonian notes.</p>
<p class="p24">His disorderly habits, when &lsquo;making provision for the day that was passing over him,&rsquo; appear from the following anecdote, communicated to me by Mr. John Nichols:&mdash; &lsquo;In the year 1763, a young bookseller, who was an apprentice to Mr. Whiston, waited on him with a subscription to his <span class="t8">Shakspeare</span>: and observing that the Doctor made no entry in any book of the subscriber&rsquo;s name, ventured diffidently to ask, whether he would please to have the gentleman&rsquo;s address, that it might be properly inserted in the printed list of subscribers. &lsquo;<span class="t8">I shall print no list of subscribers</span>;&rsquo; said Johnson, with great abruptness: but almost immediately recollecting himself, added, very complacently, &lsquo;Sir, I have two very cogent reasons for not printing any list of subscribers; &mdash; one, that I have lost all the names, &mdash; the other, that I have spent all the money.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson could not brook appearing to be worsted in argument, even when he had taken the wrong side, to shew the force and dexterity of his talents. When, therefore, he perceived that his opponent gained ground, he had recourse to some sudden mode of robust sophistry. Once when I was pressing upon him with visible advantage, he stopped me thus:&mdash; &lsquo;My dear Boswell, let&rsquo;s have no more of this; you&rsquo;ll make nothing of it. I&rsquo;d rather have you whistle a Scotch tune.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Care, however, must be taken to distinguish between Johnson when he &lsquo;talked for victory,&rsquo; and Johnson when he had no desire but to inform and illustrate. &lsquo;One of Johnson&rsquo;s principal talents (says an eminent friend of his) was shewn in maintaining the wrong side of an argument, and in a splendid perversion of the truth. If you could contrive to have his fair opinion on a subject, and without any bias from personal prejudice, or from a wish to be victorious in argument, it was wisdom itself, not only convincing, but overpowering.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He had, however, all his life habituated himself to consider conversation as a trial of intellectual vigour and skill; and to this, I think, we may venture to ascribe that unexampled richness and brilliancy which appeared in his own. As a proof at once of his eagerness for colloquial distinction, and his high notion of this eminent friend, he once addressed him thus:-&rsquo; &mdash;&mdash; , we now have been several hours together; and you have said but one thing for which I envied you.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He disliked much all speculative desponding considerations, which tended to discourage men from diligence and exertion. He was in this like Dr. Shaw, the great traveller, who Mr. Daines Barrington told me, used to say, &lsquo;I hate a <span class="t8">cui bono</span> man.&rsquo; Upon being asked by a friend what he should think of a man who was apt to say <span class="t8">non est tanti</span>;-&rsquo;That he&rsquo;s a stupid fellow, Sir; (answered Johnson): What would these <span class="t8">tanti</span> men be doing the while?&rsquo; When I in a low-spirited fit, was talking to him with indifference of the pursuits which generally engage us in a course of action, and inquiring a <span class="t8">reason</span> for taking so much trouble; &lsquo;Sir (said he, in an animated tone) it is driving on the system of life.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He told me, that he was glad that I had, by General Oglethorpe&rsquo;s means, become acquainted with Dr. Shebbeare. Indeed that gentleman, whatever objections were made to him, had knowledge and abilities much above the class of ordinary writers, and deserves to be remembered as a respectable name in literature, were it only for his admirable <span class="t8">Letters on the English Nation</span>, under the name of &lsquo;Battista Angeloni, a Jesuit.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson and Shebbeare were frequently named together, as having in former reigns had no predilection for the family of Hanover. The authour of the celebrated <span class="t8">Heroick Epistle to Sir William Chambers</span>, introduces them in one line, in a list of those &lsquo;who tasted the sweets of his present Majesty&rsquo;s reign.&rsquo; Such was Johnson&rsquo;s candid relish of the merit of that satire, that he allowed Dr. Goldsmith, as he told me, to read it to him from beginning to end, and did not refuse his praise to its execution.</p>
<p class="p24">Goldsmith could sometimes take adventurous liberties with him, and escape unpunished. Beauclerk told me that when Goldsmith talked of a project for having a third Theatre in London, solely for the exhibition of new plays, in order to deliver authours from the supposed tyranny of managers, Johnson treated it slightingly; upon which Goldsmith said, &lsquo;Ay, ay, this may be nothing to you, who can now shelter yourself behind the corner of a pension;&rsquo; and that Johnson bore this with good-humour.</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson praised the Earl of Carlisle&rsquo;s Poems, which his Lordship had published with his name, as not disdaining to be a candidate for literary fame. My friend was of opinion, that when a man of rank appeared in that character, he deserved to have his merit handsomely allowed. In this I think he was more liberal than Mr. William Whitehead, in his <span class="t8">Elegy to Lord Villiers</span>, in which under the pretext of &lsquo;superiour toils, demanding all their care,&rsquo; he discovers a jealousy of the great paying their court to the Muses: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo; &mdash;&mdash;&nbsp; &mdash; to the chosen few</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who dare excel, thy fost&rsquo;ring aid afford,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their arts, their magick powers, with honours due</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exalt; &mdash; but be thyself what they record371.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson had called twice on the Bishop of Killaloe before his Lordship set out for Ireland, having missed him the first time. He said, &lsquo;It would have hung heavy on my heart if I had not seen him. No man ever paid more attention to another than he has done to me; and I have neglected him, not wilfully, but from being otherwise occupied. Always, Sir, set a high value on spontaneous kindness. He whose inclination prompts him to cultivate your friendship of his own accord, will love you more than one whom you have been at pains to attach to you.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson told me, that he was once much pleased to find that a carpenter, who lived near him, was very ready to shew him some things in his business which he wished to see: &lsquo;It was paying (said he) respect to literature.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I asked him if he was not dissatisfied with having so small a share of wealth, and none of those distinctions in the state which are the objects of ambition. He had only a pension of three hundred a year. Why was he not in such circumstances as to keep his coach? Why had he not some considerable office? JOHNSON, &lsquo;Sir, I have never complained of the world; nor do I think that I have reason to complain. It is rather to be wondered at that I have so much. My pension is more out of the usual course of things than any instance that I have known. Here, Sir, was a man avowedly no friend to Government at the time, who got a pension without asking for it. I never courted the great; they sent for me; but I think they now give me up. They are satisfied; they have seen enough of me.&rsquo; Upon my observing that I could not believe this, for they must certainly be highly pleased by his conversation; conscious of his own superiority, he answered, &lsquo;No, Sir; great lords and great ladies don&rsquo;t love to have their mouths stopped.&rsquo; This was very expressive of the effect which the force of his understanding and brilliancy of his fancy could not but produce; and, to be sure, they must have found themselves strangely diminished in his company. When I warmly declared how happy I was at all times to hear him;&mdash; &lsquo;Yes, Sir, (said he); but if you were Lord Chancellor, it would not be so: you would then consider your own dignity.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">There was much truth and knowledge of human nature in this remark. But certainly one should think, that in whatever elevated state of life a man who <span class="t8">knew</span> the value of the conversation of Johnson might be placed, though he might prudently avoid a situation in which he might appear lessened by comparison; yet he would frequently gratify himself in private with the participation of the rich intellectual entertainment which Johnson could furnish. Strange, however, it is, to consider how few of the great sought his society; so that if one were disposed to take occasion for satire on that account, very conspicuous objects present themselves. His noble friend, Lord Elibank, well observed, that if a great man procured an interview with Johnson, and did not wish to see him more, it shewed a mere idle curiosity, and a wretched want of relish for extraordinary powers of mind. Mrs. Thrale justly and wittily accounted for such conduct by saying, that Johnson&rsquo;s conversation was by much too strong for a person accustomed to obsequiousness and flattery; it was <span class="t8">mustard in a young child&rsquo;s mouth!</span></p>
<p class="p24">One day, when I told him that I was a zealous Tory, but not enough &lsquo;according to knowledge,&rsquo; and should be obliged to him for &lsquo;a reason,&rsquo; he was so candid, and expressed himself so well, that I begged of him to repeat what he had said, and I wrote down as follows: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">OF TORY AND WHIG.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;A wise Tory and a wise Whig, I believe, will agree. Their principles are the same, though their modes of thinking are different. A high Tory makes government unintelligible: it is lost in the clouds. A violent Whig makes it impracticable: he is for allowing so much liberty to every man, that there is not power enough to govern any man. The prejudice of the Tory is for establishment; the prejudice of the Whig is for innovation. A Tory does not wish to give more real power to Government; but that Government should have more reverence. Then they differ as to the Church. The Tory is not for giving more legal power to the Clergy, but wishes they should have a considerable influence, founded on the opinion of mankind; the Whig is for limiting and watching them with a narrow jealousy.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">To MR. PERKINS.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">However often I have seen you, I have hitherto forgotten the note, but I have now sent it: with my good wishes for the prosperity of you and your partner, of whom, from our short conversation, I could not judge otherwise than favourably.</p>
<p class="p24">I am, Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">Your most humble servant,</p>
<p class="p24">SAM. JOHNSON.</p>
<p class="p24">June 2, 1781.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Saturday, June 2, I set out for Scotland, and had promised to pay a visit in my way, as I sometimes did, at Southill, in Bedfordshire, at the hospitable mansion of &lsquo;Squire Dilly, the elder brother of my worthy friends, the booksellers, in the Poultry. Dr. Johnson agreed to be of the party this year, with Mr. Charles Dilly and me, and to go and see Lord Bute&rsquo;s seat at Luton Hoe. He talked little to us in the carriage, being chiefly occupied in reading Dr. Watson&rsquo;s second volume of <span class="t8">Chemical Essays</span>, which he liked very well, and his own <span class="t8">Prince of Abyssinia</span>, on which he seemed to be intensely fixed; having told us, that he had not looked at it since it was first published. I happened to take it out of my pocket this day, and he seized upon it with avidity. He pointed out to me the following remarkable passage: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;By what means (said the prince) are the Europeans thus powerful; or why, since they can so easily visit Asia and Africa for trade or conquest, cannot the Asiaticks and Africans invade their coasts, plant colonies in their ports, and give laws to their natural princes? The same wind that carries them back would bring us thither.&rsquo; &lsquo;They are more powerful, Sir, than we, (answered Imlac,) because they are wiser. Knowledge will always predominate over ignorance, as man governs the other animals. But why their knowledge is more than ours, I know not what reason can be given, but the unsearchable will of the Supreme Being.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He said, &lsquo;This, Sir, no man can explain otherwise.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">We stopped at Welwyn, where I wished much to see, in company with Dr. Johnson, the residence of the authour of <span class="t8">Night Thoughts</span>, which was then possessed by his son, Mr. Young. Here some address was requisite, for I was not acquainted with Mr. Young, and had I proposed to Dr. Johnson that we should send to him, he would have checked my wish, and perhaps been offended. I therefore concerted with Mr. Dilly, that I should steal away from Dr. Johnson and him, and try what reception I could procure from Mr. Young; if unfavourable, nothing was to be said; but if agreeable, I should return and notify it to them. I hastened to Mr. Young&rsquo;s, found he was at home, sent in word that a gentleman desired to wait upon him, and was shewn into a parlour, where he and a young lady, his daughter, were sitting. He appeared to be a plain, civil, country gentleman; and when I begged pardon for presuming to trouble him, but that I wished much to see his place, if he would give me leave; he behaved very courteously, and answered, &lsquo;By all means, Sir; we are just going to drink tea; will you sit down?&rsquo; I thanked him, but said, that Dr. Johnson had come with me from London, and I must return to the inn and drink tea with him; that my name was Boswell, I had travelled with him in the Hebrides. &lsquo;Sir, (said he) I should think it a great honour to see Dr. Johnson here. Will you allow me to send for him?&rsquo; Availing myself of this opening, I said that &lsquo;I would go myself and bring him, when he had drunk tea; he knew nothing of my calling here.&rsquo; Having been thus successful, I hastened back to the inn, and informed Dr. Johnson that &lsquo;Mr. Young, son of Dr. Young, the authour of <span class="t8">Night Thoughts</span>, whom I had just left, desired to have the honour of seeing him at the house where his father lived.&rsquo; Dr. Johnson luckily made no inquiry how this invitation had arisen, but agreed to go, and when we entered Mr. Young&rsquo;s parlour, he addressed him with a very polite bow, &lsquo;Sir, I had a curiosity to come and see this place. I had the honour to know that great man, your father.&rsquo; We went into the garden, where we found a gravel walk, on each side of which was a row of trees, planted by Dr. Young, which formed a handsome Gothick arch; Dr. Johnson called it a fine grove. I beheld it with reverence.</p>
<p class="p24">We sat some time in the summer-house, on the outside wall of which was inscribed, <span class="t8">&lsquo;Ambulantes in horto audiebant vocem Dei</span>;&rsquo; and in reference to a brook by which it is situated, <span class="t8">&lsquo;Vivendi rectè qui prorogat horam</span>,&rsquo; &amp;c. I said to Mr. Young, that I had been told his father was cheerful. &lsquo;Sir, (said he) he was too well-bred a man not to be cheerful in company; but he was gloomy when alone. He never was cheerful after my mother&rsquo;s death, and he had met with many disappointments.&rsquo; Dr. Johnson observed to me afterwards, &lsquo;That this was no favourable account of Dr. Young; for it is not becoming in a man to have so little acquiescence in the ways of Providence, as to be gloomy because he has not obtained as much preferment as he expected; nor to continue gloomy for the loss of his wife. Grief has its time.&rsquo; The last part of this censure was theoretically made. Practically, we know that grief for the loss of a wife may be continued very long, in proportion as affection has been sincere. No man knew this better than Dr. Johnson.</p>
<p class="p24">We went into the church, and looked at the monument erected by Mr. Young to his father. Mr. Young mentioned an anecdote, that his father had received several thousand pounds of subscription-money for his <span class="t8">Universal Passion</span>, but had lost it in the South-Sea. Dr. Johnson thought this must be a mistake; for he had never seen a subscription-book.</p>
<p class="p24">Upon the road we talked of the uncertainty of profit with which authours and booksellers engage in the publication of literary works. JOHNSON. &lsquo;My judgement I have found is no certain rule as to the sale of a book.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Pray, Sir, have you been much plagued with authours sending you their works to revise?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;No, Sir; I have been thought a sour, surly fellow.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Very lucky for you, Sir, &mdash; in that respect.&rsquo; I must however observe, that notwithstanding what he now said, which he no doubt imagined at the time to be the fact, there was, perhaps, no man who more frequently yielded to the solicitations even of very obscure authours, to read their manuscripts, or more liberally assisted them with advice and correction.</p>
<p class="p24">He found himself very happy at &lsquo;Squire Dilly&rsquo;s, where there is always abundance of excellent fare, and hearty welcome.</p>
<p class="p24">On Sunday, June 3, we all went to Southill church, which is very near to Mr. Dilly&rsquo;s house. It being the first Sunday of the month, the holy sacrament was administered, and I staid to partake of it. When I came afterwards into Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s room, he said, &lsquo;You did right to stay and receive the communion; I had not thought of it.&rsquo; This seemed to imply that he did not choose to approach the altar without a previous preparation, as to which good men entertain different opinions, some holding that it is irreverent to partake of that ordinance without considerable premeditation; others, that whoever is a sincere Christian, and in a proper frame of mind to discharge any other ritual duty of our religion, may, without scruple, discharge this most solemn one. A middle notion I believe to be the just one, which is, that communicants need not think a long train of preparatory forms indispensibly necessary; but neither should they rashly and lightly venture upon so aweful and mysterious an institution. Christians must judge each for himself, what degree of retirement and self-examination is necessary upon each occasion.</p>
<p class="p24">Being in a frame of mind which, I hope for the felicity of human nature, many experience, &mdash; in fine weather, &mdash; at the country house of a friend, &mdash; consoled and elevated by pious exercises, &mdash; I expressed myself with an unrestrained fervour to my &lsquo;Guide, Philosopher, and Friend;&rsquo; &lsquo;My dear Sir, I would fain be a good man; and I am very good now. I fear GOD, and honour the King, I wish to do no ill, and to be benevolent to all mankind.&rsquo; He looked at me with a benignant indulgence; but took occasion to give me wise and salutary caution. &lsquo;Do not, Sir, accustom yourself to trust to <span class="t8">impressions</span>. There is a middle state of mind between conviction and hypocrisy, of which many are conscious. By trusting to impressions, a man may gradually come to yield to them, and at length be subject to them, so as not to be a free agent, or what is the same thing in effect, to <span class="t8">suppose</span> that he is not a free agent. A man who is in that state, should not be suffered to live; if he declares he cannot help acting in a particular way, and is irresistibly impelled, there can be no confidence in him, no more than in a tyger. But, Sir, no man believes himself to be impelled irresistibly; we know that he who says he believes it, lies. Favourable impressions at particular moments, as to the state of our souls, may be deceitful and dangerous. In general no man can be sure of his acceptance with God; some, indeed, may have had it revealed to them. St. Paul, who wrought miracles, may have had a miracle wrought on himself, and may have obtained supernatural assurance of pardon, and mercy, and beatitude; yet St. Paul, though he expresses strong hope, also expresses fear, lest having preached to others, he himself should be a cast-away.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">The opinion of a learned Bishop of our acquaintance, as to there being merit in religious faith, being mentioned; &mdash; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, yes, Sir, the most licentious man, were hell open before him, would not take the most beautiful strumpet to his arms. We must, as the Apostle says, live by faith, not by sight.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I talked to him of original sin, in consequence of the fall of man, and of the atonement made by our SAVIOUR. After some conversation, which he desired me to remember, he, at my request, dictated to me as follows: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;With respect to original sin, the inquiry is not necessary; for whatever is the cause of human corruption, men are evidently and confessedly so corrupt, that all the laws of heaven and earth are insufficient to restrain them from crimes.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Whatever difficulty there may be in the conception of vicarious punishments, it is an opinion which has had possession of mankind in all ages. There is no nation that has not used the practice of sacrifices. Whoever, therefore, denies the propriety of vicarious punishments, holds an opinion which the sentiments and practice of mankind have contradicted, from the beginning of the world. The great sacrifice for the sins of mankind was offered at the death of the MESSIAH, who is called in scripture &ldquo;The Lamb of God, that taketh away the sins of the world.&rdquo; To judge of the reasonableness of the scheme of redemption, it must be considered as necessary to the government of the universe, that GOD should make known his perpetual and irreconcileable detestation of moral evil. He might indeed punish, and punish only the offenders; but as the end of punishment is not revenge of crimes, but propagation of virtue, it was more becoming the Divine clemency to find another manner of proceeding, less destructive to man, and at least equally powerful to promote goodness. The end of punishment is to reclaim and warn. <span class="t8">That</span> punishment will both reclaim and warn, which shews evidently such abhorrence of sin in GOD, as may deter us from it, or strike us with dread of vengeance when we have committed it. This is effected by vicarious punishment. Nothing could more testify the opposition between the nature of GOD and moral evil, or more amply display his justice, to men and angels, to all orders and successions of beings, than that it was necessary for the highest and purest nature, even for DIVINITY itself, to pacify the demands of vengeance, by a painful death; of which the natural effect will be, that when justice is appeased, there is a proper place for the exercise of mercy; and that such propitiation shall supply, in some degree, the imperfections of our obedience, and the inefficacy of our repentance: for, obedience and repentance, such as we can perform, are still necessary. Our SAVIOUR has told us, that he did not come to destroy the law, but to fulfill; to fulfill the typical law, by the performance of what those types had foreshewn; and the moral law, by precepts of greater purity and higher exaltation.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">[Here he said, &lsquo;GOD bless you with it.&rsquo; I acknowledged myself much obliged to him; but I begged that he would go on as to the propitiation being the chief object of our most holy faith. He then dictated this one other paragraph.]</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The peculiar doctrine of Christianity is, that of an universal sacrifice, and perpetual propitiation. Other prophets only proclaimed the will and the threatenings of GOD. CHRIST satisfied his justice.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">The Reverend Mr. Palmer, Fellow of Queen&rsquo;s College, Cambridge, dined with us. He expressed a wish that a better provision were made for parish-clerks. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Yes, Sir, a parish-clerk should be a man who is able to make a will, or write a letter for any body in the parish.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I mentioned Lord Monboddo&rsquo;s notion that the ancient Egyptians, with all their learning, and all their arts, were not only black, but woolly-haired. Mr. Palmer asked how did it appear upon examining the mummies? Dr. Johnson approved of this test.</p>
<p class="p24">Although upon most occasions I never heard a more strenuous advocate for the advantages of wealth, than Dr. Johnson: he this day, I know not from what caprice, took the other side. &lsquo;I have not observed (said he) that men of very large fortunes enjoy any thing extraordinary that makes happiness. What has the Duke of Bedford? What has the Duke of Devonshire? The only great instance that I have ever known of the enjoyment of wealth was, that of Jamaica Dawkins, who, going to visit Palmyra, and hearing that the way was infested by robbers, hired a troop of Turkish horse to guard him.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Dr. Gibbons, the Dissenting minister, being mentioned, he said, &lsquo;I took to Dr. Gibbons.&rsquo; And addressing himself to Mr. Charles Dilly, added, &lsquo;I shall be glad to see him. Tell him, if he&rsquo;ll call on me, and dawdle over a dish of tea in an afternoon, I shall take it kind.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">The Reverend Mr. Smith, Vicar of Southill, a very respectable man, with a very agreeable family, sent an invitation to us to drink tea. I remarked Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s very respectful politeness. Though always fond of changing the scene, he said, &lsquo;We must have Mr. Dilly&rsquo;s leave. We cannot go from your house, Sir, without your permission.&rsquo; We all went, and were well satisfied with our visit. I however remember nothing particular, except a nice distinction which Dr. Johnson made with respect to the power of memory, maintaining that forgetfulness was a man&rsquo;s own fault. &lsquo;To remember and to recollect (said he) are different things. A man has not the power to recollect what is not in his mind; but when a thing is in his mind he may remember it.&rsquo; The remark was occasioned by my leaning back on a chair, which a little before I had perceived to be broken, and pleading forgetfulness as an excuse. &lsquo;Sir, (said he,) its being broken was certainly in your mind.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">When I observed that a housebreaker was in general very timorous; JOHNSON. &lsquo;No wonder, Sir; he is afraid of being shot getting <span class="t8">into</span> a house, or hanged when he has got <span class="t8">out</span> of it.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He told us, that he had in one day written six sheets of a translation from the French, adding, &lsquo;I should be glad to see it now. I wish that I had copies of all the pamphlets written against me, as it is said Pope had. Had I known that I should make so much noise in the world, I should have been at pains to collect them. I believe there is hardly a day in which there is not something about me in the newspapers.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Monday, June 4, we all went to Luton-Hoe, to see Lord Bute&rsquo;s magnificent seat, for which I had obtained a ticket. As we entered the park, I talked in a high style of my old friendship with Lord Mountstuart, and said, &lsquo;I shall probably be much at this place.&rsquo; The Sage, aware of human vicissitudes, gently checked me: &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you be too sure of that.&rsquo; He made two or three peculiar observations; as when shewn the botanical garden, &lsquo;Is not every garden a botanical garden?&rsquo; When told that there was a shrubbery to the extent of several miles: &lsquo;That is making a very foolish use of the ground; a little of it is very well.&rsquo; When it was proposed that we should walk on the pleasure-ground; &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t let us fatigue ourselves. Why should we walk there? Here&rsquo;s a fine tree, let&rsquo;s get to the top of it.&rsquo; But upon the whole, he was very much pleased. He said, &lsquo;This is one of the places I do not regret having come to see. It is a very stately place, indeed; in the house magnificence is not sacrificed to convenience, nor convenience to magnificence. The library is very splendid: the dignity of the rooms is very great; and the quantity of pictures is beyond expectation, beyond hope.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">It happened without any previous concert, that we visited the seat of Lord Bute upon the King&rsquo;s birthday; we dined and drank his Majesty&rsquo;s health at an inn, in the village of Luton.</p>
<p class="p24">In the evening I put him in mind of his promise to favour me with a copy of his celebrated Letter to the Earl of Chesterfield, and he was at last pleased to comply with this earnest request, by dictating it to me from his memory; for he believed that he himself had no copy. There was an animated glow in his countenance while he thus recalled his high-minded indignation.</p>
<p class="p24">He laughed heartily at a ludicrous action in the Court of Session, in which I was Counsel. The Society of <span class="t8">Procurators</span>, or Attornies, entitled to practise in the inferiour courts at Edinburgh, had obtained a royal charter, in which they had taken care to have their ancient designation of Procurators changed into that of <span class="t8">Solicitors</span>, from a notion, as they supposed, that it was more genteel; and this new title they displayed by a publick advertisement for a <span class="t8">General Meeting</span> at their HALL.</p>
<p class="p24">It has been said, that the Scottish nation is not distinguished for humour; and, indeed, what happened on this occasion may in some degree justify the remark: for although this society had contrived to make themselves a very prominent object for the ridicule of such as might stoop to it, the only joke to which it gave rise, was the following paragraph, sent to the newspaper called <span class="t8">The Caledonian Mercury</span>: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;A correspondent informs us, that the Worshipful Society of <span class="t8">Chaldeans</span>, <span class="t8">Cadies</span>, or <span class="t8">Running Stationers</span> of this city are resolved, in imitation, and encouraged by the singular success of their brethren, of an equally respectable Society, to apply for a Charter of their Privileges, particularly of the sole privilege of PROCURING, in the most extensive sense of the word, exclusive of chairmen, porters, penny-post men, and other <span class="t8">inferiour</span> ranks; their brethren the R &mdash; Y &mdash; L S &mdash; LL &mdash; RS, <span class="t8">alias</span> P &mdash; C &mdash; RS, <span class="t8">before the</span> INFERIOUR Courts of this City, always excepted.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Should the Worshipful Society be successful, they are farther resolved not to be <span class="t8">puffed up</span> thereby, but to demean themselves with more equanimity and decency than their <span class="t8">R &mdash; y &mdash; l, learned</span>, and <span class="t8">very modest</span> brethren above mentioned have done, upon their late dignification and exaltation.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">A majority of the members of the Society prosecuted Mr. Robertson, the publisher of the paper, for damages; and the first judgement of the whole Court very wisely dismissed the action: <span class="t8">Solventur risu tabulae, tu missus abibis</span>. But a new trial or review was granted upon a petition, according to the forms in Scotland. This petition I was engaged to answer, and Dr. Johnson with great alacrity furnished me this evening with what follows: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;All injury is either of the person, the fortune, or the fame. Now it is a certain thing, it is proverbially known, that <span class="t8">a jest breaks no bones</span>. They never have gained half-a-crown less in the whole profession since this mischievous paragraph has appeared; and, as to their reputation, What is their reputation but an instrument of getting money? If, therefore, they have lost no money, the question upon reputation may be answered by a very old position, &mdash; <span class="t8">De minimis non curat Praetor</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Whether there was, or was not, an <span class="t8">animus injuriandi</span>, is not worth inquiring, if no <span class="t8">injuria</span> can be proved. But the truth is, there was no <span class="t8">animus injuriandi</span>. It was only an <span class="t8">animus irritandi</span>, which, happening to be exercised upon a <span class="t8">genus irritabile</span>, produced unexpected violence of resentment. Their irritability arose only from an opinion of their own importance, and their delight in their new exaltation. What might have been borne by a <span class="t8">Procurator</span> could not be borne by a <span class="t8">Solicitor</span>. Your Lordships well know, that <span class="t8">honores mutant mores</span>. Titles and dignities play strongly on the fancy. As a madman is apt to think himself grown suddenly great, so he that grows suddenly great is apt to borrow a little from the madman. To co-operate with their resentment would be to promote their phrenzy; nor is it possible to guess to what they might proceed, if to the new title of Solicitor, should be added the elation of victory and triumph.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;We consider your Lordships as the protectors of our rights, and the guardians of our virtues; but believe it not included in your high office, that you should flatter our vices, or solace our vanity: and, as vanity only dictates this prosecution, it is humbly hoped your Lordships will dismiss it.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;If every attempt, however light or ludicrous, to lessen another&rsquo;s reputation, is to be punished by a judicial sentence, what punishment can be sufficiently severe for him who attempts to diminish the reputation of the Supreme Court of Justice, by reclaiming upon a cause already determined, without any change in the state of the question? Does it not imply hopes that the Judges will change their opinion? Is not uncertainty and inconstancy in the highest degree disreputable to a Court? Does it not suppose, that the former judgement was temerarious or negligent? Does it not lessen the confidence of the publick? Will it not be said, that <span class="t8">jus est aut incognitum aut vagum?</span> and will not the consequence be drawn, <span class="t8">misera est servitus?</span> Will not the rules of action be obscure? Will not he who knows himself wrong to-day, hope that the Courts of Justice will think him right to-morrow? Surely, my Lords, these are attempts of dangerous tendency, which the Solicitors, as men versed in the law, should have foreseen and avoided. It was natural for an ignorant printer to appeal from the Lord Ordinary; but from lawyers, the descendants of lawyers, who have practised for three hundred years, and have now raised themselves to a higher denomination, it might be expected, that they should know the reverence due to a judicial determination; and, having been once dismissed, should sit down in silence.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I am ashamed to mention, that the Court, by a plurality of voices, without having a single additional circumstance before them, reversed their own judgement, made a serious matter of this dull and foolish joke, and adjudged Mr. Robertson to pay to the Society five pounds (sterling money) and costs of suit. The decision will seem strange to English lawyers.</p>
<p class="p24">On Tuesday, June 5, Johnson was to return to London. He was very pleasant at breakfast; I mentioned a friend of mine having resolved never to marry a pretty woman. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, it is a very foolish resolution to resolve not to marry a pretty woman. Beauty is of itself very estimable. No, Sir, I would prefer a pretty woman, unless there are objections to her. A pretty woman may be foolish; a pretty woman may be wicked; a pretty woman may not like me. But there is no such danger in marrying a pretty woman as is apprehended: she will not be persecuted if she does not invite persecution. A pretty woman, if she has a mind to be wicked, can find a readier way than another; and that is all.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I accompanied him in Mr. Dilly&rsquo;s chaise to Shefford, where talking of Lord Bute&rsquo;s never going to Scotland, he said, &lsquo;As an Englishman, I should wish all the Scotch gentlemen should be educated in England; Scotland would become a province; they would spend all their rents in England.&rsquo; This is a subject of much consequence, and much delicacy. The advantage of an English education is unquestionably very great to Scotch gentlemen of talents and ambition; and regular visits to Scotland, and perhaps other means, might be effectually used to prevent them from being totally estranged from their native country, any more than a Cumberland or Northumberland gentleman who has been educated in the South of England. I own, indeed, that it is no small misfortune for Scotch gentlemen, who have neither talents nor ambition, to be educated in England, where they may be perhaps distinguished only by a nick-name, lavish their fortune in giving expensive entertainments to those who laugh at them, and saunter about as mere idle insignificant hangers on even upon the foolish great; when if they had been judiciously brought up at home, they might have been comfortable and creditable members of society.</p>
<p class="p24">At Shefford I had another affectionate parting from my revered friend, who was taken up by the Bedford coach and carried to the metropolis. I went with Messieurs Dilly, to see some friends at Bedford; dined with the officers of the militia of the county, and next day proceeded on my journey.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To BENNET LANGTON, ESQ.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;How welcome your account of yourself and your invitation to your new house was to me, I need not tell you, who consider our friendship not only as formed by choice, but as matured by time. We have been now long enough acquainted to have many images in common, and therefore to have a source of conversation which neither the learning nor the wit of a new companion can supply.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;My <span class="t8">Lives</span> are now published; and if you will tell me whither I shall send them, that they may come to you, I will take care that you shall not be without them.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;You will, perhaps, be glad to hear, that Mrs. Thrale is disencumbered of her brewhouse; and that it seemed to the purchaser so far from an evil, that he was content to give for it an hundred and thirty-five thousand pounds. Is the nation ruined?</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Please to make my respectful compliments to Lady Rothes, and keep me in the memory of all the little dear family, particularly pretty Mrs. Jane.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am, Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your affectionate humble servant, &lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Bolt-Court, June 16, 1781.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson&rsquo;s charity to the poor was uniform and extensive, both from inclination and principle. He not only bestowed liberally out of his own purse, but what is more difficult as well as rare, would beg from others, when he had proper objects in view. This he did judiciously as well as humanely. Mr. Philip Metcalfe tells me, that when he has asked him for some money for persons in distress, and Mr. Metcalfe has offered what Johnson thought too much, he insisted on taking less, saying &lsquo;No, no, Sir; we must not <span class="t8">pamper</span> them.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I am indebted to Mr. Malone, one of Sir Joshua Reynolds&rsquo;s executors, for the following note, which was found among his papers after his death, and which, we may presume, his unaffected modesty prevented him from communicating to me with the other letters from Dr. Johnson with which he was pleased to furnish me. However slight in itself, as it does honour to that illustrious painter, and most amiable man, I am happy to introduce it.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To SIR JOSHUA REYNOLDS. &lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;It was not before yesterday that I received your splendid benefaction. To a hand so liberal in distributing, I hope nobody will envy the power of acquiring.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am, dear Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">Your obliged and most humble servant, SAM, JOHNSON. June 23, 1781.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To THOMAS ASTLE, Esq.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am ashamed that you have been forced to call so often for your books, but it has been by no fault on either side. They have never been out of my hands, nor have I ever been at home without seeing you; for to see a man so skilful in the antiquities of my country, is an opportunity of improvement not willingly to be missed.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your notes on Alfred appear to me very judicious and accurate, but they are too few. Many things familiar to you, are unknown to me, and to most others; and you must not think too favourably of your readers: by supposing them knowing, you will leave them ignorant. Measure of land, and value of money, it is of great importance to state with care. Had the Saxons any gold coin?</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I have much curiosity after the manners and transactions of the middle ages, but have wanted either diligence or opportunity, or both. You, Sir, have great opportunities, and I wish you both diligence and success.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am, Sir, &amp;c. SAM. JOHNSON. July 17, 1781.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">The following curious anecdote I insert in Dr. Burney&rsquo;s own words: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Dr. Burney related to Dr. Johnson the partiality which his writings had excited in a friend of Dr. Burney&rsquo;s, the late Mr. Bewley, well known in Norfolk by the name of the <span class="t8">Philosopher of Massingham</span>: who, from the <span class="t8">Ramblers</span> and Plan of his <span class="t8">Dictionary</span>, and long before the authour&rsquo;s fame was established by the <span class="t8">Dictionary</span> itself, or any other work, had conceived such a reverence for him, that he urgently begged Dr. Burney to give him the cover of the first letter he had received from him, as a relick of so estimable a writer. This was in 1755. In 1760, when Dr. Burney visited Dr. Johnson at the Temple in London, where he had then Chambers, he happened to arrive there before he was up; and being shewn into the room where he was to breakfast, finding himself alone, he examined the contents of the apartment, to try whether he could undiscovered steal any thing to send to his friend Bewley, as another relick of the admirable Dr. Johnson. But finding nothing better to his purpose, he cut some bristles off his hearth-broom, and enclosed them in a letter to his country enthusiast, who received them with due reverence. The Doctor was so sensible of the honour done him by a man of genius and science, to whom he was an utter stranger, that he said to Dr. Burney, &ldquo;Sir, there is no man possessed of the smallest portion of modesty, but must be flattered with the admiration of such a man. I&rsquo;ll give him a set of my <span class="t8">Lives</span>, if he will do me the honour to accept of them.&rdquo; In this he kept his word; and Dr. Burney had not only the pleasure of gratifying his friend with a present more worthy of his acceptance than the segment from the hearth-broom, but soon after of introducing him to Dr. Johnson himself in Bolt-court, with whom he had the satisfaction of conversing a considerable time, not a fortnight before his death; which happened in St. Martin&rsquo;s-street, during his visit to Dr. Burney, in the house where the great Sir Isaac Newton had lived and died before.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">In one of his little memorandum-books is the following minute: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;August 9, 3 P.M., aetat. 72, in the summer-house at Streatham. After innumerable resolutions formed and neglected, I have retired hither, to plan a life of greater diligence, in hope that I may yet be useful, and be daily better prepared to appear before my Creator and my Judge, from whose infinite mercy I humbly call for assistance and support.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;My purpose is,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To pass eight hours every day in some serious employment.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Having prayed, I purpose to employ the next six weeks upon the Italian language, for my settled study.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">How venerably pious does he appear in these moments of solitude, and how spirited are his resolutions for the improvement of his mind, even in elegant literature, at a very advanced period of life, and when afflicted with many complaints.</p>
<p class="p24">In autumn he went to Oxford, Birmingham, Lichfield, and Ashbourne, for which very good reasons might be given in the conjectural yet positive manner of writers, who are proud to account for every event which they relate. He himself, however, says,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The motives of my journey I hardly know; I omitted it last year, and am not willing to miss it again.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">But some good considerations arise, amongst which is the kindly recollection of Mr. Hector, surgeon at Birmingham:</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Hector is likewise an old friend, the only companion of my childhood that passed through the school with me. We have always loved one another; perhaps we may be made better by some serious conversation, of which however I have no distinct hope.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He says too,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;At Lichfield, my native place, I hope to shew a good example by frequent attendance on publick worship.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">My correspondence with him during the rest of this year was I know not why very scanty, and all on my side. I wrote him one letter to introduce Mr. Sinclair (now Sir John), the member for Caithness, to his acquaintance; and informed him in another that my wife had again been affected with alarming symptoms of illness.</p>
<p class="p24">1782: AETAT. 73. &mdash; In 1782, his complaints increased, and the history of his life this year, is little more than a mournful recital of the variations of his illness, in the midst of which, however, it will appear from his letters, that the powers of his mind were in no degree impaired.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;TO JAMES BOSWELL, ESQ.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I sit down to answer your letter on the same day in which I received it, and am pleased that my first letter of the year is to you. No man ought to be at ease while he knows himself in the wrong; and I have not satisfied myself with my long silence. The letter relating to Mr. Sinclair, however, was, I believe, never brought.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;My health has been tottering this last year; and I can give no very laudable account of my time. I am always hoping to do better than I have ever hitherto done.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;My journey to Ashbourne and Staffordshire was not pleasant; for what enjoyment has a sick man visiting the sick? &mdash; Shall we ever have another frolick like our journey to the Hebrides?</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I hope that dear Mrs. Boswell will surmount her complaints; in losing her you would lose your anchor, and be tost, without stability, by the waves of life. I wish both her and you very many years, and very happy.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;For some months past I have been so withdrawn from the world, that I can send you nothing particular. All your friends, however, are well, and will be glad of your return to London.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am, dear Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Yours most affectionately,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;January 5, 1782.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">At a time when he was less able than he had once been to sustain a shock, he was suddenly deprived of Mr. Levett, which event he thus communicated to Dr. Lawrence: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Our old friend, Mr. Levett, who was last night eminently cheerful, died this morning. The man who lay in the same room, hearing an uncommon noise, got up and tried to make him speak, but without effect. He then called Mr. Holder, the apothecary, who, though when he came he thought him dead, opened a vein, but could draw no blood. So has ended the long life of a very useful and very blameless man.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am, Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your most humble servant,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Jan. 17, 1782.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">In one of his memorandum-books in my possession, is the following entry: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;January 20, Sunday. Robert Levett was buried in the church-yard of Bridewell, between one and two in the afternoon. He died on Thursday 17, about seven in the morning, by an instantaneous death. He was an old and faithful friend; I have known him from about 46. <span class="t8">Commendavi</span>. May GOD have mercy on him. May he have mercy on me.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Such was Johnson&rsquo;s affectionate regard for Levett, that he honoured his memory with the following pathetick verses: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Condemd&rsquo;d to Hope&rsquo;s delusive mine,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As on we toil from day to day,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By sudden blast or slow decline</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our social comforts drop away.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well try&rsquo;d through many a varying year,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See LEVETT to the grave descend;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Officious, innocent, sincere,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of every friendless name the friend434.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet still he fills affection&rsquo;s eye,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obscurely wise435, and coarsely kind;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor, letter&rsquo;d arrogance436, deny</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy praise to merit unrefin&rsquo;d.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When fainting Nature call&rsquo;d for aid,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And hov&rsquo;ring Death prepar&rsquo;d the blow,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His vigorous remedy display&rsquo;d</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of art without the show.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Misery&rsquo;s darkest caverns known,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His ready help was ever nigh,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where hopeless Anguish pour&rsquo;d his groan,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And lonely want retir&rsquo;d to die437.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No summons mock&rsquo;d by chill delay,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No petty gains disdain&rsquo;d by pride;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The modest wants of every day</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The toil of every day supply&rsquo;d.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His virtues walk&rsquo;d their narrow round,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor made a pause, nor left a void;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sure the Eternal Master found</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His single talent well employ&rsquo;d.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The busy day, the peaceful night438,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfelt, uncounted, glided by;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His frame was firm, his powers were bright,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though now his eightieth year was nigh439.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, with no throbs of fiery pain,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No cold gradations of decay,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Death broke at once the vital chain,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And freed his soul the nearest way.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">In one of Johnson&rsquo;s registers of this year, there occurs the following curious passage: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Jan. 20. The Ministry is dissolved. I prayed with Francis and gave thanks.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">It has been the subject of discussion, whether there are two distinct particulars mentioned here? or that we are to understand the giving of thanks to be in consequence of the dissolution of the Ministry? In support of the last of these conjectures may be urged his mean opinion of that Ministry, which has frequently appeared in the course of this work; and it is strongly confirmed by what he said on the subject to Mr. Seward:&mdash; &lsquo;I am glad the Ministry is removed. Such a bunch of imbecility never disgraced a country. If they sent a messenger into the City to take up a printer, the messenger was taken up instead of the printer, and committed by the sitting Alderman. If they sent one army to the relief of another, the first army was defeated and taken before the second arrived. I will not say that what they did was always wrong; but it was always done at a wrong time.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;TO MRS. STRAHAN.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;DEAR MADAM,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Mrs. Williams shewed me your kind letter. This little habitation is now but a melancholy place, clouded with the gloom of disease and death. Of the four inmates, one has been suddenly snatched away; two are oppressed by very afflictive and dangerous illness; and I tried yesterday to gain some relief by a third bleeding, from a disorder which has for some time distressed me, and I think myself to-day much better.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am glad, dear Madam, to hear that you are so far recovered as to go to Bath. Let me once more entreat you to stay till your health is not only obtained, but confirmed. Your fortune is such as that no moderate expence deserves your care; and you have a husband, who, I believe, does not regard it. Stay, therefore, till you are quite well. I am, for my part, very much deserted; but complaint is useless. I hope GOD will bless you, and I desire you to form the same wish for me.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am, dear Madam,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your most humble servant,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Feb. 4, 1782.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To EDMOND MALONE, ESQ.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I have for many weeks been so much out of order, that I have gone out only in a coach to Mrs. Thrale&rsquo;s, where I can use all the freedom that sickness requires. Do not, therefore, take it amiss, that I am not with you and Dr. Farmer. I hope hereafter to see you often.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am, Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your most humble servant,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Feb. 27, 1782.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">To THE SAME.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I hope I grow better, and shall soon be able to enjoy the kindness of my friends. I think this wild adherence to Chatterton more unaccountable than the obstinate defence of Ossian. In Ossian there is a national pride, which may be forgiven, though it cannot be applauded. In Chatterton there is nothing but the resolution to say again what has once been said.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am, Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your humble servant,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;March 7, 1782.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">These short letters shew the regard which Dr. Johnson entertained for Mr. Malone, who the more he is known is the more highly valued. It is much to be regretted that Johnson was prevented from sharing the elegant hospitality of that gentleman&rsquo;s table, at which he would in every respect have been fully gratified. Mr. Malone, who has so ably succeeded him as an Editor of Shakspeare, has, in his Preface, done great and just honour to Johnson&rsquo;s memory.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;TO MRS. LUCY PORTER, IN LICHFIELD.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;DEAR MADAM,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I went away from Lichfield ill, and have had a troublesome time with my breath; for some weeks I have been disordered by a cold, of which I could not get the violence abated, till I had been let blood three times. I have not, however, been so bad but that I could have written, and am sorry that I neglected it.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;My dwelling is but melancholy; both Williams, and Desmoulins, and myself, are very sickly: Frank is not well; and poor Levett died in his bed the other day, by a sudden stroke; I suppose not one minute passed between health and death; so uncertain are human things.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Such is the appearance of the world about me; I hope your scenes are more cheerful. But whatever befalls us, though it is wise to be serious, it is useless and foolish, and perhaps sinful, to be gloomy. Let us, therefore, keep ourselves as easy as we can; though the loss of friends will be felt, and poor Levett had been a faithful adherent for thirty years.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Forgive me, my dear love, the omission of writing; I hope to mend that and my other faults. Let me have your prayers.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Make my compliments to Mrs. Cobb, and Miss Adey, and Mr. Pearson, and the whole company of my friends.</p>
<p class="p24">I am, my dear,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your most humble servant,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;London, March 2, 1782.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">TO THE SAME.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;DEAR MADAM,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;My last was but a dull letter, and I know not that this will be much more cheerful; I am, however, willing to write, because you are desirous to hear from me.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;My disorder has now begun its ninth week, for it is not yet over. I was last Thursday blooded for the fourth time, and have since found myself much relieved, but I am very tender and easily hurt; so that since we parted I have had but little comfort, but I hope that the spring will recover me; and that in the summer I shall see Lichfield again, for I will not delay my visit another year to the end of autumn.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I have, by advertising, found poor Mr. Levett&rsquo;s brothers in Yorkshire, who will take the little he has left: it is but little, yet it will be welcome, for I believe they are of very low condition.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To be sick, and to see nothing but sickness and death, is but a gloomy state; but I hope better times, even in this world, will come, and whatever this world may withhold or give, we shall be happy in a better state. Pray for me, my dear Lucy.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Make my compliments to Mrs. Cobb, and Miss Adey, and my old friend Hetty Baily, and to all the Lichfield ladies.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am, dear Madam,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Yours, affectionately,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Bolt-court, Fleet-street,</p>
<p class="p24">March 19, 1782.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On the day on which this letter was written, he thus feelingly mentions his respected friend and physician, Dr. Lawrence: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Poor Lawrence has almost lost the sense of hearing; and I have lost the conversation of a learned, intelligent, and communicative companion, and a friend whom long familiarity has much endeared. Lawrence is one of the best men whom I have known. &mdash; <span class="t8">Nostrum omnium miserere Deus</span>.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">It was Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s custom when he wrote to Dr. Lawrence concerning his own health, to use the Latin language. I have been favoured by Miss Lawrence with one of these letters as a specimen: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;T. LAWRENCIO, <span class="t8">Medico, S</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;NOVUM <span class="t8">frigus, nova tussis, nova spirandi difficultas, novam sanguinis missionem suadent, quam tamen te inconsulto nolim fieri. Ad te venire vix possum, nec est cur ad me venias. Licere vel non licere uno verbo dicendum est; catera mihi et Holdero reliqueris. Si per te licet, imperatur nuncio Holderum ad me deducere.</span></p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Maiis Calendis, 1782.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Postquàm tu discesseris, quò me vertam?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">TO CAPTAIN LANGTON, IN ROCHESTER.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;It is now long since we saw one another; and whatever has been the reason neither you have written to me, nor I to you. To let friendship die away by negligence and silence, is certainly not wise. It is voluntarily to throw away one of the greatest comforts of this weary pilgrimage, of which when it is, as it must be, taken finally away, he that travels on alone, will wonder how his esteem could be so little. Do not forget me; you see that I do not forget you. It is pleasing in the silence of solitude to think, that there is one at least, however distant, of whose benevolence there is little doubt, and whom there is yet hope of seeing again.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Of my life, from the time we parted, the history is mournful. The spring of last year deprived me of Thrale, a man whose eye for fifteen years had scarcely been turned upon me but with respect or tenderness; for such another friend, the general course of human things will not suffer man to hope. I passed the summer at Streatham, but there was no Thrale; and having idled away the summer with a weakly body and neglected mind, I made a journey to Staffordshire on the edge of winter. The season was dreary, I was sickly, and found the friends sickly whom I went to see. After a sorrowful sojourn, I returned to a habitation possessed for the present by two sick women, where my dear old friend, Mr. Levett, to whom as he used to tell me, I owe your acquaintance, died a few weeks ago, suddenly in his bed; there passed not, I believe, a minute between health and death. At night, as at Mrs. Thrale&rsquo;s I was musing in my chamber, I thought with uncommon earnestness, that however I might alter my mode of life, or whithersoever I might remove, I would endeavour to retain Levett about me; in the morning my servant brought me word that Levett was called to another state, a state for which, I think, he was not unprepared, for he was very useful to the poor. How much soever I valued him, I now wish that I had valued him more.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I have myself been ill more than eight weeks of a disorder, from which at the expence of about fifty ounces of blood, I hope I am now recovering.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;You, dear Sir, have, I hope, a more cheerful scene; you see George fond of his book, and the pretty misses airy and lively, with my own little Jenny equal to the best: and in whatever can contribute to your quiet or pleasure, you have Lady Rothes ready to concur. May whatever you enjoy of good be encreased, and whatever you suffer of evil be diminished.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am, dear Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your humble servant,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Bolt-court, Fleet-street,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;March 20, 1782.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;To MR. HECTOR, IN BIRMINGHAM461.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I hope I do not very grossly flatter myself to imagine that you and dear Mrs. Careless will be glad to hear some account of me. I performed the journey to London with very little inconvenience, and came safe to my habitation, where I found nothing but ill health, and, of consequence, very little cheerfulness. I then went to visit a little way into the country, where I got a complaint by a cold which has hung eight weeks upon me, and from which I am, at the expence of fifty ounces of blood, not yet free. I am afraid I must once more owe my recovery to warm weather, which seems to make no advances towards us.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Such is my health, which will, I hope, soon grow better. In other respects I have no reason to complain. I know not that I have written any thing more generally commended than the <span class="t8">Lives of the Poets</span>; and have found the world willing enough to caress me, if my health had invited me to be in much company; but this season I have been almost wholly employed in nursing myself.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;When summer comes I hope to see you again, and will not put off my visit to the end of the year. I have lived so long in London, that I did not remember the difference of seasons.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your health, when I saw you, was much improved. You will be prudent enough not to put it in danger. I hope, when we meet again, we shall all congratulate each other upon fair prospects of longer life; though what are the pleasures of the longest life, when placed in comparison with a happy death?</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am, dear Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Yours most affectionately,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;London, March 21, 1782.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">To THE SAME.</p>
<p class="p24">[Without a date, but supposed to be about this time.]</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
