<p class="p21">I.i.20 (358,4)</p>
<p class="p24">One Michael Cassio, a Florentine,</p>
<p class="p24">A fellow almost damn&rsquo;d in a fair wife]</p>
<p class="p24">This is one of the passages which must for the present be resigned to corruption and obscurity. I have nothing that I can, with any approach to confidence, propose. I cannot think it very plain from Act 3. Scene 1. that Cassio was or was not a Florentine.</p>
<p class="p24">I.i.30 (361,6) must be belee&rsquo;d and calm&rsquo;d] [ &mdash; <span class="t8">must be</span> LED <span class="t8">and calm&rsquo;d</span>. So the old quarto. The first folio reads <span class="t8">belee&rsquo;d</span>: but that spoils the measure. I read LET, hindered. WARBURTON.] <span class="t8">Belee&rsquo;d</span> suits to <span class="t8">calm&rsquo;d</span>, and the measure is not less perfect than in many other places.</p>
<p class="p24">I.i.36 (361,7) Preferment goes by letter] By <span class="t8">recommendation</span> from powerful friends.</p>
<p class="p24">I.i.37 (361,8) And not by old gradation] [W: Not (as of old)] <span class="t8">Old gradation</span>, is <span class="t8">gradation</span> established by<span class="t8">ancient</span> practice. Where is the difficulty?</p>
<p class="p24">I.i.39 (361,9) If I in any just term am affin&rsquo;d] <span class="t8">Affine</span> is the reading of the third quarto and the first folio. The second quarto and all the modern editions have <span class="t8">assign&rsquo;d</span>. The meaning is, <span class="t8">Do I stand</span> within <span class="t8">any such</span> terms <span class="t8">of propinquit</span> or <span class="t8">relation to the Moor, as that it is my duty to love him</span>?</p>
<p class="p24">I.i.49 (362,1) honest knaves] <span class="t8">Knave</span> is here for <span class="t8">servant</span>, but with a mixture of sly contempt.</p>
<p class="p24">I.i.63 (362,2) In compliment extern] In that which I do only for an outward shew of civility.</p>
<p class="p24">I.i.76 (363,3) As when, by night and negligence, the fire/Is spied in populous cities] [Warburton, objecting to &ldquo;by&rdquo;: Is spred] The particle is used equivocally; the same liberty is taken by writers more correct.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">The wonderful creature! a woman of reason!</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Never grave</span> out of <span class="t8">pride, never gay</span> out of <span class="t8">season</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">I.i.115 (364,4) What profane wretch art thou?] That is, <span class="t8">what wretch of gross and licentious language?</span> In that sense Shakespeare often uses the word <span class="t8">profane</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">I.i.124 (365,6) this odd even] The <span class="t8">even</span> of <span class="t8">night</span> is <span class="t8">midnight</span>, the time when night is divided into <span class="t8">even</span> parts.</p>
<p class="p24">I.i.149 (366,7) some check] Some rebuke.</p>
<p class="p24">I.i.150 (366,8) cast him] That is, <span class="t8">dismiss</span> him; <span class="t8">reject</span> him. We still say, a <span class="t8">cast</span> coat, and a <span class="t8">cast</span> serving-man.</p>
<p class="p24">I.i.162 (366,9) And what&rsquo;s to come of my despised time] [W: despited] <span class="t8">Despised time</span>, is <span class="t8">time of no value</span>; time in which</p>
<p class="p24">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing serious in mortality,</p>
<p class="p24">The wine of life is drawn, and the mere dregs</p>
<p class="p24">Are left, this vault to brag of.&rdquo; <span class="t8">Macbeth</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">I.i.173 (367,2) By which the property of youth and maidhood/May be abus&rsquo;d?] By which the faculties of a young virgin may be infatuated, and made subject to illusions and to false imagination.</p>
<p class="p24">&ldquo;Wicked dreams <span class="t8">abuse</span></p>
<p class="p24">The curtain&rsquo;d sleep.&rdquo; <span class="t8">Macbeth.</span></p>
<p class="p24">I.ii.2 (368,3) stuff o&rsquo; the conscience] This expression to common readers appears harsh. <span class="t8">Stuff</span> of the <span class="t8">conscience</span> is, <span class="t8">substance</span>, or <span class="t8">essence</span> of the conscience. <span class="t8">Stuff</span> is a word of great force in the Teutonic languages. The elements are called in Dutch, <span class="t8">Hoefd stoffen</span>, or <span class="t8">head stuffs</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">I.ii.13 (368,4) And hath, in his effect, a voice potential/As double as the duke&rsquo;s] [Warburton had given a source in Dioscorides and Theocritus for &ldquo;double&rdquo;] This note has been much censured by Mr. Upton, who denies, that the quotation is in Dioscorides, and disputes, not without reason, the interpretation of Theocritus.</p>
<p class="p24">All this learning, if it had even been what it endeavours to be thought, is, in this place, superfluous. There is no ground of supposing, that our author copied or knew the Greek phrase; nor does it follow, that, because a word has two senses in one language, the word which in another answers to one sense, should answer to both. <span class="t8">Manus</span>, in Latin, signifies both a <span class="t8">hand</span> and <span class="t8">troop of soldiers</span>, but we cannot say, that <span class="t8">the captain marched at the</span> head <span class="t8">of his</span> hand; or, that <span class="t8">he laid his</span> troop <span class="t8">upon his sword</span>. It is not always in books that the meaning is to be sought of this writer, who was much more acquainted with naked reason and with living manners.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Double</span> has here its natural sense. The president of every deliberative assembly has a <span class="t8">double voice</span>. In our courts, the chief justice and one of the inferior judges prevail over the other two, because the chief justice has a <span class="t8">double</span> voice.</p>
<p class="p24">Brabantio had, <span class="t8">in his effect</span>, though not by law, yet by <span class="t8">weight</span> and <span class="t8">influence</span>, a voice not <span class="t8">actual</span> and formal, but <span class="t8">potential</span> and operative, as <span class="t8">double</span>, that is, a voice that when a question was suspended, would turn the balance as effectually <span class="t8">as the duke&rsquo;s</span>. <span class="t8">Potential</span> is used in the sense of science; a <span class="t8">caustic</span> is called <span class="t8">potential</span> fire.</p>
<p class="p24">I.ii.23 (370,7) speak, unbonnetted] [Pope: unbonnetting] I do not see the propriety of Mr. Pope&rsquo;s emendation, though adopted by Dr. Warburton. <span class="t8">Unbonnetting</span> may as well be, <span class="t8">not putting on</span>, as <span class="t8">not putting off</span>, the bonnet. Hamner reads <span class="t8">e&rsquo;en</span> bonnetted.</p>
<p class="p24">I.ii.26 (370,8) unhoused] Free from <span class="t8">domestic</span> cares. A thought natural to an adventurer.</p>
<p class="p24">I.ii.28 (370,9) For the sea&rsquo;s worth] I would not marry her, though she were as rich as the Adriatic, which the Doge annually marries.</p>
<p class="p24">I.ii.30 (371,2) a land-carrack] A <span class="t8">carrack</span> is a ship of great bulk, and commonly of great value; perhaps what we now call a <span class="t8">galleon</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">I.ii.55 (372,3) be advis&rsquo;d] That is, be <span class="t8">cool</span>; be <span class="t8">cautious</span>; be <span class="t8">discreet</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">I.ii.68 (372,4) The wealthy curled darlings of our nation] <span class="t8">Curled</span> is <span class="t8">elegantly and ostentatiously dressed</span>. He had not the hair particularly in his thoughts.</p>
<p class="p24">I.ii.74 (373,6) Abused her delicate youth with drugs, or minerals,/ That weaken notion] [T: notion] Hanmer reads with equal probability, <span class="t8">That</span> waken motion. [Originally <span class="t8">motion</span>].</p>
<p class="p24">I.iii.6 (375,9) As in these cases where they aim reports] [W: the aim] The folio has,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&mdash; <span class="t8">the</span> aim reports.</p>
<p class="p24">But, <span class="t8">they aim reports</span>, has a sense sufficiently easy and commodious. There men <span class="t8">report</span> not by certain knowledge, but by <span class="t8">aim</span> and conjecture.</p>
<p class="p24">I.ii.18 (375,1) By no assay of reason] Bring it to the <span class="t8">test</span>, examine it by reason as we examine metals by the <span class="t8">assay</span>, it will be found counterfeit by all trials.</p>
<p class="p24">I.iii.23 (376,2) facile question] <span class="t8">Question</span> is for the <span class="t8">act of seeking</span>. With more <span class="t8">easy endeavour</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">I.iii.24 (376,4) warlike brace] State of defence. To arm was called to <span class="t8">brace on</span> the armour.</p>
<p class="p24">I.iii.42 (376,5) And prays you to believe him] The late learned and ingenious Mr. Thomas Clark, of Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn, read the passage thus:</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">And prays you to</span> relieve <span class="t8">him</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">But the present reading may stand. <span class="t8">He intreats you not to doubt the truth of this intelligence</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">I.iii.54 (377,6) Hath rais&rsquo;d me from my bed; nor doth the general care] The word <span class="t8">care</span>, which encumbers the verse, was probably added by the players. Shakespeare uses <span class="t8">the general</span> as a substantive, though, I think, not in this sense.</p>
<p class="p24">I.iii.69 (373,8) though our proper son/Stood in your action] Were the man exposed to your <span class="t8">charge</span> or <span class="t8">accusation</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">I.iii.80 (378,9) The very head and front of my offending] The <span class="t8">main</span>, the <span class="t8">whole</span>, unextenuated.</p>
<p class="p24">I.iii.85 (379,2) Their dearest action] That is <span class="t8">dear</span>, for which much is paid, whether money or labour; <span class="t8">dear action</span>, is action performed at great expence, either of ease or safety.</p>
<p class="p24">I.iii.107 (380,4) overt test] Open proofs, external evidence.</p>
<p class="p24">I.iii.108 (380,5) thin habits and poor likelihoods/Of modern seeming] Weak shew of slight appearance.</p>
<p class="p24">I.iii.139 (381,6) And portance in my travel&rsquo;s history] [I have restored,</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">And with it all my travel&rsquo;s history</span>:</p>
<p class="p24">From the old edition. It is in the rest,</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">And portance in my travel&rsquo;s history</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">Rymer, in his criticism on this play, has changed it to <span class="t8">portents</span>, instead of <span class="t8">portance</span>. POPE.] Mr. Pope has restored a line, to which there is little objection, but which has no force. I believe <span class="t8">portance</span> was the author&rsquo;s word in some revised copy. I read thus,</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Of being &mdash;&mdash; sold</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">To slavery, of my redemption, thence,</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">And portance in&rsquo;t; my travel&rsquo;s history.</span></p>
<p class="p24">My redemption from slavery, and behaviour in it.</p>
<p class="p24">I.iii.140-170 (381,7) Wherein of antres vast, and desarts idle] Whoever ridicules this account of the progress of love, shows his ignorance, not only of history, but of nature and manners. It is no wonder that, in any age, or in any nation, a lady, recluse, timorous, and delicate, should desire to hear of events and scenes which she could never see, and should admire the man who had endured dangers and performed actions, which, however great, were yet magnified by her timidity. [Pope: deserts wild] Every mind is liable to absence and inadvertency, else Pope could never have rejected a word so poetically beautiful. Idle is an epithet used to express the infertility of the chaotic state, in the Saxon translation of the Pentateuch. (1773)</p>
<p class="p24">I.iii.140 (382,8) antres] [French grottos. POPE.] Rather <span class="t8">caves</span> and <span class="t8">dens</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">I.iii.142 (382,9) It was my hint to speak] [W: hent] <span class="t8">Hent</span> is not used in Shakespeare, nor, I believe, in any other author; <span class="t8">hint</span>, or <span class="t8">cue</span>, is comnonly used for occasion of speech, which is explained by, <span class="t8">such was the process</span>, that is, the course of the tale required it. If <span class="t8">hent</span> be restored, it may be explained by <span class="t8">handle</span>. I had a <span class="t8">handle</span>, or <span class="t8">opportunity</span>, to speak of cannibals.</p>
<p class="p24">I.iii.144 (382,1) men whose heads/Do grow beneath their shoulders] Of these men there is an account in the interpolated travels of Mondeville, a book of that time.</p>
<p class="p24">I.iii.199 (384,4) Let me speak like yourself;] [W: our self] Hanmer reads,</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Let me</span> now speak <span class="t8">more</span> like your self.</p>
<p class="p24">Dr. Warburton&rsquo;s emendation is specious; but I do not see how Hanmer&rsquo;s makes any alteration. The duke seems to mean, when he says he will speak like Brabantio, that he will speak sententiously.</p>
<p class="p24">I.iii.213 (385,6) But the free comfort which from thence he hears] But the moral precepts of consolation, which are liberally bestowed on occasion of the sentence.</p>
<p class="p24">I.iii.232 (386,8) thrice-driven bed of down] A <span class="t8">driven</span> bed, is a bed for which the feathers are selected, by <span class="t8">driving</span> with a fan, which separates the light from the heavy.</p>
<p class="p24">I.iii.237 (337,9)</p>
<p class="p24">I crave fit disposition for my wife;</p>
<p class="p24">Due reverence of place, and exhibition]</p>
<p class="p24">I desire, that a proper <span class="t8">disposition</span> be made for my wife, that she may have <span class="t8">precedency</span>, and <span class="t8">revenue</span>, accommodation, and <span class="t8">company</span>, suitable to her rank.</p>
<p class="p24">For <span class="t8">reference</span> of place, the old quartos have <span class="t8">reverence</span>, which Hanmer has received. I should read,</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Due</span> preference <span class="t8">of place</span>. &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">I.iii.246 (387,1) And let me find a charter in your voice] Let your favour <span class="t8">privilege</span> me.</p>
<p class="p24">I.iii.250 (387,2) My down-right violence and storm of fortunes] [W: to forms, my fortunes] There is no need of this emendation. <span class="t8">Violence</span> is not <span class="t8">violence suffered</span>, but <span class="t8">violence acted</span>. Breach of common rules and obligations. The old quarto has, <span class="t8">scorn</span> of fortune, which is perhaps the true reading.</p>
<p class="p24">I.iii.253 (388,3) I saw Othello&rsquo;s visage in his mind] It must raise no wonder, that I loved a man of an appearance so little engaging; I saw his face only in his mind; the greatness of his character reconciled me to his form.</p>
<p class="p24">I.iii.264 (386,4)</p>
<p class="p24">Nor to comply with heat (the young affects,</p>
<p class="p24">In me defunct) and proper satisfaction]</p>
<p class="p24">[T: me distinct, i.e. with that heat and new affections which the indulgence of my appetite has raised and created. This is the meaning of <span class="t8">defunct</span>, which has made all the difficulty of the passage. WARBURTON.] I do not think that Mr. Theobald&rsquo;s emendation clears the text from embarrassment, though it is with a little imaginary improvement received by Hanmer, who reads thus:</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Nor to comply with heat</span>, affects the young</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">In my</span> distinct <span class="t8">and proper satisfaction</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">Dr. Warburton&rsquo;s explanation is not more satisfactory: what made the difficulty, will continue to make it. I read,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&mdash; <span class="t8">I beg it not,</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">To please the palate of my appetite,</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Nor to comply with heat (the young affects</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">In me defunct) and proper satisfaction;</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">But to be free and bounteous to her mind.</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Affects</span> stands here, not for <span class="t8">love</span>, but for <span class="t8">passions</span>, for that by which any thing is affected. <span class="t8">I ask it not</span>, says he, <span class="t8">to please appetite, or satisfy loose desires</span>, the passions of youth which I have now outlived, or <span class="t8">for any particular gratification of myself, but merely that I may indulge the wishes of my wife</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">Mr. Upton had, before me, changed <span class="t8">my</span> to <span class="t8">me</span>; but he has printed young <span class="t8">effects</span>, not seeming to know that <span class="t8">affects</span> could be a noun. (1773)</p>
<p class="p24">I.iii.290 (391,6) If virtue no delighted beauty lack] [W: belighted] Hanmer reads, more plausibly, <span class="t8">delighting</span>. I do not know that <span class="t8">belighted</span> has any authority. I should rather read,</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">If virtue no</span> delight or <span class="t8">beauty lack</span>.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Delight</span>, for <span class="t8">delectation</span>, or <span class="t8">power of pleasing</span>, as it is frequently used.</p>
<p class="p24">I.iii.299 (391,8) best advantage] Fairest opportunity.</p>
<p class="p24">I.iii.317 (392,9) a Guinea-hen] A showy bird with fine feathers.</p>
<p class="p24">I.iii.346 (392,1) defeat thy favour with an usurped beard] [W: disseat] It is more English, to <span class="t8">defeat</span>, than <span class="t8">disseat</span>. To <span class="t8">defeat</span>, is to <span class="t8">undo</span>, to <span class="t8">change</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">I.iii.350 (393,2) It was a violent commencement in her, and thou shalt see an answerable sequestration] There seems to be an opposition of terms here intended, which has been lost in transcription. We may read, <span class="t8">It was a violent</span> conjunction, <span class="t8">and thou shalt see an answerable sequestration</span>; or, what seems to me preferable, <span class="t8">It was a violent commencement, and thou shalt see an answerable sequel</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">I.iii.363 (393,4) betwixt an erring Barbarian] [W: errant] Hanmer reads, <span class="t8">errant</span>. <span class="t8">Erring</span> is as well as either.</p>
<p class="p24">II.i.15 (396,1) And quench the guards of the ever-fixed pole] Alluding to the star <span class="t8">Arctophylax</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">II.i.48 (397,3)</p>
<p class="p24">His bark is stoutly timber&rsquo;d, and his pilot</p>
<p class="p24">Of very expert and approv&rsquo;d allowance;</p>
<p class="p24">Therefore my hopes, not surfeited to death,</p>
<p class="p24">Stand in bold cure]</p>
<p class="p24">I do not understand these lines. I know not how <span class="t8">hope</span> can be <span class="t8">surfeited to death</span>, that is, <span class="t8">can be encreased, till it is destroyed</span>; nor what it is <span class="t8">to stand in bold cure</span>; or why <span class="t8">hope</span> should be considered as a disease. In the copies there is no variation. Shall we read</p>
<p class="p24">Therefore my fears, not surfeited to death,</p>
<p class="p24">Stand in bold cure?</p>
<p class="p24">This is better, but it is not well. Shall we strike a bolder stroke, and read thus?</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Therefore my hopes, not</span> forfeited <span class="t8">to death</span>,</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Stand</span> bold, not sure.</p>
<p class="p24">II.i.49 (398,4) Of very expert and approv&rsquo;d allowance] I read, <span class="t8">Very expert, and of approv&rsquo;d allowance</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">II.i.64 (308,5) And in the essential vesture of creation/Does bear all excellency; We in terrestrial] I do not think the present reading inexplicable. The author seems to use <span class="t8">essential</span>, for <span class="t8">existent, real</span>. She excels the praises of invention, says he, and in <span class="t8">real qualities</span>, with which <span class="t8">creation</span> has <span class="t8">invested</span> her, <span class="t8">bears all excellency</span>.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Does bear all excellency</span> &mdash;&mdash; ] Such is the reading of the quartos, for which the folio has this,</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">And in the essential vesture of creation</span></p>
<p class="p24">Do&rsquo;s tyre the ingeniuer.</p>
<p class="p24">Which I explain thus,</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Does tire the</span> ingenious verse.</p>
<p class="p24">This is the best reading, and that which the author substituted in his revisal.</p>
<p class="p24">II.i.112 (401,9) Saints in your injuries] When you have a mind to do injuries, you put on an air of sanctity.</p>
<p class="p24">II.i.120 (402,1) I am nothing, if not critical] That is, <span class="t8">censorious</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">II.i.137 (402,2) <span class="t8">She never yet was foolish</span>] We may read,</p>
<p class="p24">She ne&rsquo;er was yet so foolish that was fair,</p>
<p class="p24">But even her folly help&rsquo;d her to an heir.</p>
<p class="p24">Yet I believe the common reading to be right; the lay makes the power of cohabitation a proof that a man is not a <span class="t8">natural</span>; therefore, since the foolishest woman, if <span class="t8">pretty</span>, may have a child, no <span class="t8">pretty woman</span> is ever foolish.</p>
<p class="p24">II.i.146 (403,3) put on the vouch of very malice itself] <span class="t8">To put on the vouch of malice</span>, is to assume a character vouched by the testimony of malice itself.</p>
<p class="p24">II.i.165 (404,5) profane] Gross of language, of expression broad and brutal. So Brabantio, in the first act, calls Iago <span class="t8">profane</span> wretch.</p>
<p class="p24">II.i.165 (404,6) liberal counsellor.] <span class="t8">Counsellor</span> seems to mean, not so much a man that <span class="t8">gives counsel</span>, us one that discourses fearlessly and volubly. A talker.</p>
<p class="p24">II.i.177 (405,8) well kiss&rsquo;d! an excellent courtesy!] [ &mdash; <span class="t8">well kissed</span>, and <span class="t8">excellent courtesy</span>; &mdash; ] This I think should be printed, <span class="t8">well kiss&rsquo;d</span>! an <span class="t8">excellent courtesy</span>! Spoken when Cassio kisses his hand, and Desdemona courtesies. [The old quarto confirms Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s emendation. STEEVENS.]</p>

<p class="p24">II.i.252 (407,5) green minds] Minds unripe, minds not yet fully formed.</p>
<p class="p24">II.i.254 (408,6) she is full of most bless&rsquo;d condition] Qualities, disposition of mind.</p>

<p class="p24">II.i.283 (408,9) whose qualification shall come into no true taste again] Whose resentment shall not be so <span class="t8">qualified</span> or <span class="t8">tempered</span>, as to be <span class="t8">well tasted</span>, as not to retain <span class="t8">some bitterness</span>. The phrase is harsh, at least to our ears.</p>
<p class="p24">II.i.306 (409,1) like a poisonous mineral] This is philosophical. Mineral poisons kill by corrosion.</p>
<p class="p24">II.i.314 (411,4) I&rsquo;ll have our Michael Cassio on the hip] A phrase from the art of wrestling.</p>
<p class="p24">II.i.321 (411,6) Knavery&rsquo;s plain face is never seen] An honest man acts upon a plan, and forecasts his designs; but a knave depends upon temporary and local opportunities, and never knows his own purpose, but at the time of execution.</p>
<p class="p24">II.iii.14 (413,8) Our general cast us] That is, <span class="t8">appointed us to our stations</span>. To <span class="t8">cast the play</span>, is, in the stile of the theatres, to assign to every actor his proper part.</p>
<p class="p24">II.iii.26 (413,9) And when she speaks, is it not an alarum to love?] The voice may <span class="t8">sound</span> an <span class="t8">alarm</span> more properly than the <span class="t8">eye</span> can <span class="t8">sound</span> a <span class="t8">parley</span>.</p>

<p class="p24">II.iii.348 (425,5) free elements] Liberal, bountiful, as the elements, out of which all things are produced.</p>
<p class="p24">II.iii.355 (425,6) to this parallel course] i.e. a course level, and even with his design.</p>
<p class="p24">II.iii.363 (425,8) That she repeals him] That is, recalls him.</p>
<p class="p24">II.iii.382 (426,1)</p>
<p class="p24">Though ether things grew fair against the sun,</p>
<p class="p24">Yet fruits, that blossom first, will first be ripe]</p>
<p class="p24">Of many different things, all planned with the same art, and promoted with the same diligence, some must succeed sooner than others, by the order of nature. Every thing cannot be done at once; we must proceed by the necessary gradation. We are not to <span class="t8">despair</span> of slow events any <span class="t8">more</span> than of tardy fruits, while the causes are in regular progress, and the fruits <span class="t8">grow fair against the sun</span>. Hanmer has not, I think, rightly conceived the sentiment; for he reads,</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Those fruits which blossom first</span>, are not first <span class="t8">ripe</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">I have therefore drawn it out at length, for there are few to whom that will be easy which was difficult to Hanmer.</p>
<p class="p24">III.i.3 (427,2) Why, masters, have your instruments been in Naples, that they speak i&rsquo; the nose thus?] The venereal disease first appeared at the siege of Naples.</p>
<p class="p24">III.iii.14 (430,6)</p>
<p class="p24">That policy may either last so long,</p>
<p class="p24">Or feed upon such nice and waterish diet,</p>
<p class="p24">Or breed itself so out of circumstance,</p>
<p class="p24">That I, being absent, and my place supplied,</p>
<p class="p24">My general will forget my love and service]</p>
<p class="p24">He may either of himself think it politic to keep me out of office so long, or he may be satisfied with such slight reasons, or so many accidents may make him think my re-admission at that time improper, that I may be quite forgotten.</p>
<p class="p24">III.iii.23 (431,7) I&rsquo;ll watch him tame] It is said, that the ferocity of beasts, insuperable and irreclaimable by any other means, is subdued by keeping them from sleep.</p>
<p class="p24">III.iii.47 (431,8) His present reconciliation take] [W: make] To <span class="t8">take his reconciliation</span>, may be to accept the submission which he makes in order to be reconciled.</p>
<p class="p24">III.iii.65 (432,1) the wars must make examples/Out of their best] The severity of military discipline must not spare the <span class="t8">best men</span> of the army, when their punishment nay afford a wholesome <span class="t8">example</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">III.iii.90 (433,2) Excellent wretch! &mdash; Perdition catch my soul,/But I do love thee!] The meaning of the word <span class="t8">wretch</span>, is not generally understood. It is now, in some parts of England, a term of the softest and fondest tenderness. It expresses the utmost degree of amiableness, joined with an idea, which perhaps all tenderness includes, of feebleness, softness, and want of protection. Othello, considering Desdemona as excelling in beauty and virtue, soft and timorous by her sex, and by her situation absolutely in his power, calls her <span class="t8">Excellent wretch!</span> It may be expressed,</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Dear, harmless, helpless Excellence.</span></p>
<p class="p24">III.iii.91 (433,3) when I love thee not,/Chaos is come again] When my love is for a moment suspended by suspicion, I have nothing in my mind but discord, tumult, perturbation, and confusion.</p>
<p class="p24">III.iii.123 (435,4) They are close delations working from the heart,/ That passion cannot rule] <span class="t8">They are</span> cold dilations <span class="t8">working from the heart,/That passion cannot rule</span>.] I know not why the modern editors are satisfied with this reading, which no explanation can clear. They might easily have found, that it is introduced without authority. The old copies uniformly give, <span class="t8">close dilations</span>, except that the earlier quarto has <span class="t8">close denotements</span>; which was the author&rsquo;s first expression, afterwards changed by him, not to <span class="t8">cold dilations</span>, for <span class="t8">cold</span> is read in no ancient copy; nor, I believe, to <span class="t8">close dilations</span>, but to <span class="t8">close delations</span>; to <span class="t8">occult</span> and <span class="t8">secret accusations, working</span> involuntarily <span class="t8">from the heart</span>, which, though resolved to conceal the fault, cannot rule its <span class="t8">passion</span> of resentment.</p>
<p class="p24">III.iii.127 (435,5) Or, those that be not, &lsquo;would they might seem none!] [W: seem knaves] I believe the meaning is, <span class="t8">would they might no longer seem</span>, or bear the shape of <span class="t8">men</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">III.iii.140 (436,6) Keep leets and law-days] [i.e. govern. WARBURTON.] Rather <span class="t8">visit</span> than <span class="t8">govern</span>, but visit with authoritative intrusion.</p>
<p class="p24">III.iii.149 (437,8) From one that so improbably conceits] &mdash; imperfectly <span class="t8">conceits</span>,] In the old quarto it is,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&mdash; improbably <span class="t8">conceits</span>,</p>
<p class="p24">Which I think preferable.</p>
<p class="p24">III.iii.166 (437,9) the green-ey&rsquo;d monster, which doth make/The meat it feeds on] <span class="t8">which doth</span> mock <span class="t8">The meat it feeds on</span>.] I have received Hanmer&rsquo;s emendation [&ldquo;make&rdquo;]; because <span class="t8">to mock</span>, does not signify <span class="t8">to loath</span>; and because, when Iago bids Othello <span class="t8">beware of jealousy, the green-eyed monster</span>, it is natural to tell why he should beware, and for caution he gives him two reasons, that jealousy <span class="t8">often</span> creates its own cause, and that, when the causes are real, jealousy is misery.</p>
<p class="p24">III.iii.173 (438,1) But riches, fineless] Unbounded, endless, unnumbered treasures.</p>
<p class="p24">III.iii.180 (438,3)</p>
<p class="p24">Exchange me for a goat,</p>
<p class="p24">When I shall turn the business of my soul</p>
<p class="p24">To such exsuffolate and blown surmises,</p>
<p class="p24">Matching thy inference]</p>
<p class="p24">This odd and far-fetched word was made yet more uncouth in all the editions before Hanmer&rsquo;s, by being printed, <span class="t8">exsufflicate</span>. The allusion is to a bubble. Do not think, says the Moor, that I shall change the noble designs that now employ my thoughts, to suspicions which, like bubbles <span class="t8">blown</span> into a wide extent, have only an empty shew without solidity, or that in consequence of such empty fears, I will close with thy inference against the virtue of my wife.</p>
<p class="p24">III.iii.188 (439,4) Where virtue is, those are most virtuous] An action in itself indifferent grows virtuous by its end and application.</p>
<p class="p24">III.iii.201 (439,6)</p>
<p class="p24">I know our country disposition well;</p>
<p class="p24">In Venice they do let heaven see the pranks]</p>
<p class="p24">Here Iago seems to be a Venetian.</p>
<p class="p24">III.iii.207 (440,7) And, when she seem&rsquo;d to shake, and fear your looks,/She lov&rsquo;d them most] This and the following argument of Iago ought to be deeply impressed on every reader. Deceit and falsehood, whatever conveniencies they may for a time promise or produce, are, in the sum of life, obstacles to happiness. Those, who profit by the cheat, distruat the deceiver, and the act, by which kindness was sought, puts an end to confidence.</p>
<p class="p24">The same objection may be made with a lower degree of strength against the imprudent generosity of disproportionate marriages. When the first heat of passion is over, it is easily succeeded by suspicion, that the same violence of inclination, which caused one irregularity, may stimulate to another; and those who have shown, that their passions are too powerful for their prudence, will, with very alight appearances againat them, be censured, as not very likely to restrain them by their virtue. (see 1765, VIII, 397, 1)</p>
<p class="p24">III.iii.210 (440,8) To seel her father&rsquo;s eyes up, close as oak] There is little relation between <span class="t8">eyes</span> and <span class="t8">oak</span>. I would read,</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">She seel&rsquo;d her father&rsquo;s eyes up close as</span> owl&rsquo;s.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">As blind as an owl</span>, is a proverb.</p>
<p class="p24">III.iii.222 (441,1) My speech would fall into such vile success] [<span class="t8">Success</span>, far succession, i.e. conclusion; not prosperous issue. WARB.] I rather think there is a depravation, and would read,</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">My speech would fall into such vile</span> excess.</p>
<p class="p24">If <span class="t8">success</span> be the right word, it seems to mean <span class="t8">consequence</span> or <span class="t8">event</span>, as <span class="t8">successo</span> is used in Italian.</p>
<p class="p24">III.iii.232 (441,2) will most rank] <span class="t8">Will</span>, is for wilfulness. It is so used by Ascham. A <span class="t8">rank will</span>, is <span class="t8">self-will</span> overgrown and exuberant.</p>
<p class="p24">III.iii.249 (442,3) You shall by that perceive him, and his means] You shall discover whether he thinks his best <span class="t8">means</span>, his most powerful <span class="t8">interest</span>, is by the solicitation of your lady.</p>
<p class="p24">III.iii.250 (442,4) strain his entertainnent] Press hard his re-admission to his pay and office. <span class="t8">Entertainment</span> was the military term for admission of soldiers.</p>
<p class="p24">III.iii.256 (442,5) Fear not my government] Do not distrust ay ability to contain my passion.</p>
<p class="p24">III.iii.259 (442,6) knows all qualities, with a learned spirit,/Of human dealings] The construction is, He knows with a learned spirit all qualities of human dealings.</p>
<p class="p24">III.iii.260 (442,7) If I do prore her haggard] A <span class="t8">haggard</span> hark, is a <span class="t8">wild</span> hawk, a <span class="t8">hawk unreclaimed</span>, or <span class="t8">irreclaimable</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">III.iii.262 (443,8) I&rsquo;d whistle her off, and let her down the wind,/ To prey at fortune] The falconers always let fly the hawk against the wind; if she flies with the wind behind her, she seldom returns. If therefore a hawk was for any reason to be dismissed, she was <span class="t8">let down the wind</span>, and from that time shifted far herself, and <span class="t8">preyed at fortune</span>. This was told me by the late Mr. Clark.</p>
<p class="p24">III.iii.276 (443,9) forked plague] In allusion to a <span class="t8">barbed</span> or <span class="t8">forked</span> arrow, which, once infixed, cannot be extracted.</p>
<p class="p24">III.iii.312 (445,2) And, to the advantage, I, being here, took it up] I being <span class="t8">opportunely</span> here, took it up.</p>
<p class="p24">III.iii.319 (445,3) Be not you known on&rsquo;t] Should it not rather be read,</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Be not you known</span> in&rsquo;t?</p>
<p class="p24">The folio reads,</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Be not</span> unknown <span class="t8">on&rsquo;t</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">The sense is plain, but of the expression I cannot produce any example.</p>
<p class="p24">III.iii.332 (446,5) that sweet sleep,/Which thou owedst yesterday] To <span class="t8">owe</span> is, in our author, oftener to <span class="t8">possess</span>, than <span class="t8">to be indebted</span>, and such was its meaning here; but as that sense was growing less usual, it was changed unnecessarily by the editors to <span class="t8">hadst</span>; to the sane meaning, more intelligibly expressed.</p>
<p class="p24">III.iii.351 (447,6)</p>
<p class="p24">Farewell the neighing steed, and the shrill trump,</p>
<p class="p24">The spirit-stirring drum, the ear-piercing fife]</p>
<p class="p24">Dr. Warburton has offered <span class="t8">fear-spersing</span>, for <span class="t8">fear-dispersing</span>. But <span class="t8">ear-piercing</span> is an epithet so eminently adapted to the <span class="t8">fife</span>, and so distinct from the shrillness of the trumpet, that it certainly ought not to be changed. Dr. Warburton has been censured for this proposed emendation with more noise than honesty, for he did not himself put it in the text.</p>
<p class="p24">III.iii.369 (449,8) abandon all remorse] [<span class="t8">Remorse</span>, for repentance. WARBURTON.] I rather think it is, Let go all scruples, throw aside all restraints.</p>
<p class="p24">III.iii.429 (451,4) <span class="t8">Oth.</span> &rsquo;tis a shrewd doubt] [The old quarto gives this line, with the two following, to Iago; and rightly. WARB.] I think it more naturally spoken by Othello, who, by dwelling so long upon the proof, encouraged Iago to enforce it.</p>
<p class="p24">III.iii.448 (452,8) hearted throne] [W: parted] <span class="t8">Hearted</span> throne, is the heart on which thou wast <span class="t8">enthroned</span>. <span class="t8">Parted</span> throne has no meaning.</p>
<p class="p24">III.iii.467 (453,3)</p>
<p class="p24">Let him command,</p>
<p class="p24">And to obey, shall be in me remorse,</p>
<p class="p24">What bloody business ever]</p>
<p class="p24">[Pope: Not to obey] [T: Nor, to obey.] [W: me. Remord] Of these two emendations, I believe, Theobald&rsquo;s will have the greater number of suffrages; it has at least mine. The objection against the propriety of the declaration in Iago is a cavil; he does not say that he has no principle of remorse, but that it shall not operate against Othello&rsquo;s commands. <span class="t8">To obey shall be in me</span>, for <span class="t8">I will obey you</span>, is a mode of expression not worth the pains here taken to introduce it; and the word <span class="t8">remords</span> has not in the quotation the meaning of <span class="t8">withhold</span>, or <span class="t8">make reluctant</span>, but of <span class="t8">reprove</span>, or <span class="t8">censure</span>; nor do I know that it is used by any of the contemporaries of Shakespeare.</p>
<p class="p24">I will offer an interpretation, which, if it be received, will make alteration unnecessary, but it is very harsh and violent. Iago devotes himself to wronged Othello, and says, <span class="t8">Let him command whatever bloody business</span>, and in me it shall be an act, not of cruelty, but <span class="t8">of tenderness, to obey him</span>; not of malice to other, but of <span class="t8">tenderness</span> for him. If this sense be thought too violent, I see nothing better than to follow Pope&rsquo;s reading, as it is improved by Theobald.</p>
<p class="p24">III.iv.26 (457,5) cruzadoes] [A Portugueze coin, in value three shillings sterling. Dr. GREY.] So called from the cross stamped upon it.</p>
<p class="p24">III.iv.46 (458,6) The hearts, of old, gave hands] [Warburton explains this is an allusion to James the First&rsquo;s practice of creating baronets for money and emends to &ldquo;The hands of old gave hearts&rdquo;] The historical observation is very judicious and acute, but of the emendation there is no need. She says, that her hand gave away <span class="t8">her heart</span>. He goes on with his suspicion, and the hand which he had before called <span class="t8">frank</span>, he now terms <span class="t8">liberal</span>; then proceeds to remark, that <span class="t8">the hand was formerly given by the heart</span>; but now it neither gives it, nor is given by it.</p>
<p class="p24">III.iv.51 (459,7) salt and sullen rheum] &mdash; <span class="t8">salt and</span> sorry rheum] The old quarto has,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&mdash; <span class="t8">salt and</span> sullen <span class="t8">rheum</span> &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">That is, a <span class="t8">rheum obstinately troublesome</span>. I think this better.</p>

<p class="p24">A Sybil, that had numbred in the world</p>
<p class="p24">The sun to course two hundred compasses]</p>
<p class="p24">The expression is not very infrequent; we say, <span class="t8">I counted the clock to strike four</span>; so she <span class="t8">number&rsquo;d</span> the sun <span class="t8">to course</span>, to run <span class="t8">two hundred compasses</span>, two hundred annual circuits.</p>
<p class="p24">III.iv.79 (460,1) Why do you speak so startingly, and rash?] Is <span class="t8">vehement, violent</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">III.iv.103 (461,2) &rsquo;Tis not a year, or two, shews us a man] From this line it may be conjectured, that the author intended the action of the play to be considered as longer than is marked by any note of time. Since their arrival at Cyprus, to which they were hurried on their wedding-night, the fable seems to have been in one continual progress, nor can I see any vacuity into which a <span class="t8">year or two</span>, or even a month or two, could be put. On the night of Othello&rsquo;s arrival, a feast was proclaimed; at that feast Cassio was degraded, and immediately applies to Desdemona to get him restored. Iago indeed advises Othello to hold him off a while, but there is no reason to think, that he has been held off long. A little longer interval would increase the probability of the story, though it might violate the rules of the drama. See Act. 5. Sc. 2. (see 1765, VIII, 416, 1)</p>
<p class="p24">III.iv.113 (461,3) the duty of my heart] &mdash; the office <span class="t8">of my heart</span>.] The elder quarto reads,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&mdash; <span class="t8">the</span> duty <span class="t8">of my heart</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">The author used the more proper word, and then changed it, I suppose, for fashionable diction; but, as fashion is a very weak protectress, the old word is now ready to resume its place.</p>

<p class="p24">But to know so, must be my benefit]</p>

<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Endue with a sense of pain</span>, is an expression, which, though it might be endured, if it were genuine, cannot deserve to be introduced by artifice. The copies, both quarto and folio, read, <span class="t8">Endue our other healthful members even to a sense of pain</span>. I believe it should be rather, SUBDUE <span class="t8">our other healthful members to a sense of pain</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">III.iv.151 (463,2) (unhandsome warrior as I am)] [W: wrangler] <span class="t8">Unhandsome warrior</span>, is evidently <span class="t8">unfair assailant</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">III.iv.178 (464,3) a more continuate time] &mdash; <span class="t8">more</span> convenient <span class="t8">time</span>] The folio has,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&mdash; <span class="t8">more</span> continuate <span class="t8">time</span>;</p>
<p class="p24">Time <span class="t8">less interrupted</span>, time which I can call more my own. It gives a more distinct image than <span class="t8">convenient</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">III.iv.180 (464,4) Take me this work out] The meaning is not, &ldquo;Pick out the work, and leave the ground plain;&rdquo; but, &ldquo;Copy this work in another handkerchief.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">IV.i.5 (466,6)</p>
<p class="p24">Naked in bed, Iago, and not mean harm?</p>
<p class="p24">It is hypocrisy against the devil]</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Hypocrisy against the devil</span>, means hypocrisy to cheat the devil. As common hypocrites cheat men, by seeming good, and yet living wickedly, these men would cheat the devil, by giving him flattering hopes, and at last avoiding the crime which he thinks them ready to commit.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.i.22 (467,8) Boding to all] Thus all the old copies. The moderns, less grammatically,</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Boding to</span> ill &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">IV.i.42 (468,2) without sone instruction] [W: induction] This is a noble conjecture, and whether right or wrong does honour to its author. Yet I am in doubt whether there is any necessity of emendation. There has always prevailed in the world an opinion, that when any great calamity happens at a distance, notice is given of it to the sufferer by some dejection or perturbation of mind, of which he discovers no external cause. This is ascribed to that general communication of one part of the universe with another, which is called sympathy and antipathy; or to the secret monition, <span class="t8">instruction</span>, and influence of a superior Being, which superintends the order of nature and of life. Othello says, <span class="t8">Nature could not invest herself in such shadowing passion without</span> instruction. <span class="t8">It is not words that shake me thus.</span> This passion, which spreads its clouds over me, is the effect of some agency more than the operation of words; it is one of those notices which men have of unseen calamities.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.i.76 (471,4) Confine yourself but in a patient list] For attention; act of listening.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.i.82 (471,5) encave yourself] Hide yourself in a private place.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.i.89 (471,6) Or I shall say, you are all in all in spleen,/And nothing of a man] I read,</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Or shall I say, you&rsquo;re all in all a spleen</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">I think our author uses this expression elsewhere.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.i.121 (472,8) Do you triumph, Roman? do you triumph?] Othello calls him <span class="t8">Roman</span> ironically. <span class="t8">Triumph</span>, which was a Roman ceremony, brought Roman into his thoughts. <span class="t8">What</span> (says he) <span class="t8">you are now</span> triumphing <span class="t8">as great as a Roman</span>?</p>
<p class="p24">IV.i.123 (472,9) a customer!] A common woman, one that invites custom.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.i.130 (473,1) Have you scar&rsquo;d me? Have you made my reckoning? have you settled the term of my life? The old quarto reads, <span class="t8">stored</span> me. Have you disposed of me? have you laid me up?</p>
<p class="p24">IV.i.150 (473,2) &rsquo;Tis such another fitchew! marry, a perfum&rsquo;d one] Shakespeare has in another place mentioned the lust of this animal. He tells Iago, that she is as lewd as the <span class="t8">polecat</span>, but of better scent, the polecat being a very stinking animal.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.i.244 (476,4) atone them] Make them <span class="t8">one</span>; reconcile them.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.i.256 (477,5)</p>
<p class="p24">If that the earth could teem with woman&rsquo;s tears,</p>
<p class="p24">Each drop she falls would prove a crocodile]</p>
<p class="p24">If womens tears could impregnate the earth. By the doctrine of equivocal generation, new animals were supposed producible by new combinations of matter. See Bacon.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.i.277 (478,7)</p>
<p class="p24">whose solid virtue</p>
<p class="p24">The shot of accident, nor dart of chance,</p>
<p class="p24">Could neither graze nor pierce]</p>
<p class="p24">[T: of change] To <span class="t8">graze</span> is not merely to touch superficially, but to strike not directly, not so as to bury the body of the thing striking in the matter struck.</p>
<p class="p24">Theobald trifles, as is usual. <span class="t8">Accident</span> and <span class="t8">chance</span> may admit a subtle distinction; <span class="t8">accident</span> may be considered as the <span class="t8">act</span>, and <span class="t8">chance</span> as the <span class="t8">power</span> or <span class="t8">agency</span> of fortune; as, <span class="t8">It was</span> by chance <span class="t8">that this</span> accident <span class="t8">befel me</span>. At least, if we suppose all corrupt that is inaccurate, there will be no end of emendation.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.ii.57 (482,1) garner&rsquo;d up my heart] That is, <span class="t8">treasured</span> up; the <span class="t8">garner</span> and the <span class="t8">fountain</span> are improperly conjoined.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.ii.62 (482,2)</p>
<p class="p24">Turn thy complexion there!</p>
<p class="p24">Patience, thou young and rose-lipp&rsquo;d cherubim;</p>
<p class="p24">Ay, there, look grim as hell]</p>
<p class="p24">At such an object do thou, <span class="t8">patience</span>, thyself <span class="t8">change colour</span>; at this do thou, even thou, <span class="t8">rosy cherub</span> as thou art, <span class="t8">look grim as hell</span>. The old editions and the new have it,</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">I here look grim as hell.</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">I</span> was written for <span class="t8">ay</span>, and not since corrected.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.ii.109 (484,4) The small&rsquo;st opinion on my great&rsquo;st abuse] The old quarto reads [for &ldquo;least misuse&rdquo;],</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">The small&rsquo;st opinion on my</span> great&rsquo;st abuse.</p>
<p class="p24">Which I think is better.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.ii.140 (486,6) Some base notorious knave] For <span class="t8">gross</span>, not in its proper meaning for <span class="t8">known</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.ii.144 (486,7) Speak within door] Do not clamour so as to be heard beyond the house.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.ii.146 (486,8) the seamy side without] That is, <span class="t8">inside out</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.iii.27 (490,2) and he, she lov&rsquo;d, prov&rsquo;d mad,/And did forsake her] I believe that <span class="t8">mad</span> only signifies <span class="t8">wild, frantick, uncertain</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.iii.31 (490,3) I have much to do,/But to go hang my head] I <span class="t8">have much</span> ado to do any thing <span class="t8">but hang my head</span>. We might read,</p>
<p class="p24">Not <span class="t8">to go hang my head</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">This is perhaps the only insertion made in the latter editions which has improved the play. The rest seem to have been added for the sake of amplification, or of ornament. When the imagination had subsided, and the mind was no longer agitated by the horror of the action, it became at leisure to look round for specious additians. This addition is natural. Desdemona can at first hardly forbear to sing the song; she endeavours to change her train of thoughts, but her imagination at last prevails, and she sings it.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.iii.41 (491,4)</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Des.</span> &ldquo;The poor soul sat singing by a sycamore-tree,</p>
<p class="p24">&ldquo;Sing all a green willow]</p>
<p class="p24">This song, in two parts, is printed in a late collection of old ballads; the lines preserved here differ somewhat from the copy discovered by the ingenious collector.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.iii.55 (491,5)</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Des.</span> &ldquo;I call&rsquo;d my love false love; but what said</p>
<p class="p24">&ldquo;he then?</p>
<p class="p24">&ldquo;Sing willow, &amp;c.]</p>
<p class="p24">This couplet is not in the ballad, which is the complaint, not of a woman forsaken, but of a man rejected. These lines were probably added when it was accommodated to a woman.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.iii.94 (493,6) our former having] Our former allowance of experience.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.iii.107 (493,7) heaven me such usage send] &mdash; <span class="t8">heaven me such</span> uses <span class="t8">send</span>,] Such is the reading of the folio, and of the subsequent editions; but the old quarto has,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&mdash; <span class="t8">such</span> usage <span class="t8">send</span>. &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Usage</span> is an old word for <span class="t8">custom</span>, and, I think, better than <span class="t8">uses</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">V.i.11 (494,1) I have rubb&rsquo;d this young quat <span class="t8">almost to the sense</span>] In some editions,</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">I&rsquo;ve rubb&rsquo;d this young</span> gnat <span class="t8">almost to the sense,</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">And he grows angry</span>.]</p>
<p class="p24">This is a passage much controverted among the editors. Sir T. Hanner reads <span class="t8">quab</span>, a <span class="t8">gudgeon</span>; not that a gudgeon can be <span class="t8">rubbed</span> to much <span class="t8">sense</span>, but that a man grossly deceived is often called a <span class="t8">gudgeon</span>. Mr. Upton reads <span class="t8">quail</span>, which he proves, by much learning, to be a very choleric bird. Dr. Warburton retains <span class="t8">gnat</span>, which is found in the early quarto. Theobald would introduce <span class="t8">knot</span>, a small bird of that name. I have followed the text of the folio, and third and fourth quartos.</p>
<p class="p24">A <span class="t8">quat</span> in the midland counties is a <span class="t8">pimple</span>, which by rubbing is made to smart, or is <span class="t8">rubbed to sense</span>. Roderigo is called a <span class="t8">quat</span> by the same mode of speech, as a low fellow is now termed in lay language a <span class="t8">scab. To rub to the sense</span>, is <span class="t8">to rub to the quick</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">V.i.37 (496,2) No passage?] No passengers? No body going by?</p>
<p class="p24">V.i.42 (499,4) a heary night] A <span class="t8">thick cloudy</span> night, in which an ambush may be commodiously laid.</p>
<p class="p24">V.ii.1 (499,4) It is the cause, it is the cause, my soul; &mdash; /Let me not name it] The abruptness of this soliloquy makes it obscure. The meaning, I think, is this: &ldquo;I am here (says Othello in his mind) overwhelmed with horror. What is the reason of this perturbation? Is it want of resolution to do justice? Is it the dread of shedding blood? No; it is not the action that shocks me, but <span class="t8">it is the cause, it is the cause, my soul; let me not name it to you, ye chaste stars; it is the cause</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">V.ii.20 (500,7)</p>
<p class="p24">I must weep,</p>
<p class="p24">But they are cruel tears: this sorrel&rsquo;s heavenly;</p>
<p class="p24">It strikes, where it doth love. &mdash; She wakes &mdash; ]</p>
<p class="p24">This tenderness, with which I lament the punishment which justice compels me to inflict, is a holy passion.</p>
<p class="p24">I wish these two lines could be honestly ejected. It is the fate of Shakespeare to counteract his own pathos.</p>
<p class="p24">V.ii.65 (502,8) A murder, which I thought a sacrifice] This line is difficult. <span class="t8">Thou hast hardened my heart, and makest me</span> kill thee with the rage of a <span class="t8">murderer</span>, when <span class="t8">I thought to have sacrificed</span> thee to justice with the calmness of a priest striking a victim.</p>
<p class="p24">It must not be omitted, that one of the elder quartos reads, <span class="t8">thou dost stone</span> thy <span class="t8">heart</span>; which I suspect to be genuine. The meaning then will be, <span class="t8">thou forcest me</span> to dismiss thee from the world in the state of the <span class="t8">murdered</span> without preparation for death, <span class="t8">when I intended</span> that thy punishment should have been a <span class="t8">sacrifice</span> atoning for thy crime.</p>
<p class="p24">I am glad that I have ended my revisal of this dreadful scene. It is not to be endured.</p>
<p class="p24">V.ii.134 (505,3) false as water] As water that will support no weight, nor keep any impression.</p>
<p class="p24">V.ii.151 (506,4) villainy has made mocks with love] <span class="t8">Villainy</span> has taken advantage to <span class="t8">play upon</span> the weakness of a violent passion.</p>
<p class="p24">V.ii.162 (506,5) Thou hast not half that power to do me harm, /As I have to be hurt] [Hamner: to bear hurt] The Oxford Editor saw well the meaning of his author, but weakened his expression. She means to say, <span class="t8">I have in this cause power to endure more than thou hast power to inflict</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">V.ii.183 (507, 6) charm your tongue] I know not whether I have read, or whether my own thoughts hare suggested, an alteration of this passage. It seems to me not improbable, that Shakespeare wrote <span class="t8">clam</span> your tongue; to <span class="t8">clam</span> a bell, is to cover the clapper with felt, which drowns the blow, and hinders the sound.</p>
<p class="p24">V.ii.211 (509,7) she with Cassio had the act of shame/A thousand times committed] This is another passage which seems to suppose a longer space comprised in the action of this play than the scenes include.</p>
<p class="p24">V.ii.253 (512,2) It was a sword of Spain, the ice-brook&rsquo;s temper] [In the first edition it is, <span class="t8">Isebroke&rsquo;s temper</span>. Thence corrupted to <span class="t8">Ice-brook&rsquo;s</span>. &mdash; <span class="t8">Ebro&rsquo;s temper</span>; the waters of that river of Spain are particularly famous for tempering of steel. POPE.] I believe the old reading changed to <span class="t8">ice-brook</span> is right. Steel is hardened by being put red hot into very cold water.</p>
<p class="p24">V.ii.286 (513,3)</p>
<p class="p24">I look down towards his feet; but that&rsquo;s a fable.</p>
<p class="p24">If that thou be&rsquo;st a devil, I cannot kill thee]</p>
<p class="p24">To see if, according to the common opinion, his feet be cloven.</p>
<p class="p24">V.ii.292 (513,4) Fall&rsquo;n in the practice of a cursed slave] In the <span class="t8">snare</span>, by the <span class="t8">stratagem</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">V.ii.317 (514,5) in the interim] The first copy has, <span class="t8">in the</span> nick. It was, I suppose, thought upon revisal, that <span class="t8">nick</span> was too familiar.</p>
<p class="p24">V.ii.342 (515,6) Speak of me as I am] The early copies read, <span class="t8">Speak of them as they are</span>. The present reading has more force. (rev. 1778, X, 622, 6)</p>
<p class="p24">(520,2) General Observation. The beauties of this play impress themselves so strongly upon the attention of the reader, that they can draw no aid from critical illustration. The fiery openness of Othello, magnanimous, artless, and credulous, boundless in his confidence, ardent in his affection, inflexible in his resolution, and obdurate in his revenge; the cool malignity of Iago, silent in his resentment, subtle in his designs, and studious at once of his interest and his vengeance; the soft simplicity of Desdemona, confident of merit, and conscious of innocence, her artless perseverance in her suit, and her slowness to suspect that she can be suspected, are such proofs of Shakespeare&rsquo;s skill in human nature, as, I suppose, it is vain to seek in any modern writer. The gradual progress which Iago makes in the Moor&rsquo;s conviction, and the circumstances which he employs to inflame him, are so artfully natural, that, though it will perhaps not be said of him as he says of himself, that he is <span class="t8">a man not easily jealous</span>, yet we cannot but pity him, when at last we find him <span class="t8">perplexed in the extreme</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">There is always danger, lest wickedness, conjoined with abilities, should steal upon esteem, though it misses of approbation; but the character of Iago is so conducted, that he is from the first scene to the last hated and despised.</p>
<p class="p24">Even the inferior characters of this play would be very conspicuous in any other piece, not only for their justness, but their strength. Cassio is brave, benevolent, and honest, ruined only by his want of stubbornness to resist an insidious invitation. Roderigo&rsquo;s suspicious credulity, and impatient submission to the cheats which he sees practised upon him, and which by persuasion he suffers to be repeated, exhibit a strong picture of a weak mind betrayed by unlawful desires to a false friend; and the virtue of Aemilia is such as we often find, worn loosely, but not cast off, easy to commit small crimes, but quickened and alarmed at atrocious villainies.</p>
<p class="p24">The scenes from the beginning to the end are busy, varied by happy interchanges, and regularly promoting the progression of the story; and the narrative in the end, though it tells but what is known already, yet is necessary to produce the death of Othello.</p>
<p class="p24">Had the scene opened in Cyprus, and the preceding incidents been occasionally related, there had been little wanting to a drama of the most exact and scrupulous regularity.</p>
<p class="p24">(LI 2) Appendix. Some apology perhaps is necessary for the inconvenience of an Appendix, which, however, we can justify by the strongest of all pleas, the plea of necessity. The Notes which it contains, whether communicated by correspondents, or collected from published volumes, were not within our reach when the plays were printed, to which they relate. Of that which chance has supplied, we could have no previous knowledge; and he that waited till the river should run dry, did not act with less reason than the Editor would do, who should suspend his publication for possibilities of intelligence, or promises of improvement. Had we foreseen the <span class="t8">Oxford</span> edition, the assistance we expected from it might have persuaded us to pause; but our volumes were completely finished before its publication. [There are no notes by Johnson in this Appendix; several are by Steevens.]</p>
