<p class="p32">The leaves are large, fleshy, and of a glaucous colour; the flowers consist of four leaves, which are succeeded by long taper pods, containing several round acrid seeds.

The common white, red, flat, and long-sided <span class="t8">cabbages</span>, are chiefly cultivated for winter use; the seeds of which must be sown in the middle of March, in beds of good fresh earth. The Russian <span class="t8">cabbage</span> was formerly in much greater esteem than at present, and is rarely brought to the market. The early Battersea and sugar-loaf <span class="t8">cabbages</span>, are called Michaelmas <span class="t8">cabbages</span>; the season for sowing them is in the middle of July, in an open spot of ground. The Savoy <span class="t8">cabbages</span> are propagated for winter use, as being generally esteemed the better, when pinched by frost. The <span class="t8">boorcole</span> is never eaten till the frost has rendered it tender. The turnep <span class="t8">cabbage</span> was formerly more cultivated in England than at present; and some esteem this kind for soups, but it is generally too strong, and seldom good, except in hard winters. The curled <span class="t8">colewort</span> is more generally esteemed, and is fit for use after Christmas, and continues good until April. The musk <span class="t8">cabbage</span> has, through negligence, been almost lost in England, though, for eating, it is one of the best kinds we have; for it is always looser, and the leaves more crisp and tender, and has a most agreeable musky scent when cut. It will be fit for use in October, November, and December. The branching sea <span class="t8">cabbage</span> is found wild in England, and on the sea coast, and is sometimes gathered by the poor inhabitants in the spring, and eaten; but it is apt to be strong and bitter. The brown <span class="t8">broccoli</span> is by many esteemed, though it does not deserve a place in the kitchen garden, where the Roman <span class="t8">broccoli</span> can be obtained, which is much sweeter, and will continue longer in season. The Roman <span class="t8">broccoli</span> has large heads, which appear in the center of the plants like clusters of buds. The heads should be cut before they run up to seed, with about four or five inches of the stems; the skin of these stems should be stripped off, before they are boiled; they will eat very tender, and little inferiour to asparagus. The common <span class="t8">colewort</span> is now almost lost near London, where their markets are usually supplied with <span class="t8">cabbage</span> or Savoy plants instead of them; which, being tenderer and more delicate, are better worth cultivating. The perennial Alpine <span class="t8">colewort</span> is also little cultivated at present. The other two sorts of wild <span class="t8">cabbage</span> are varieties fit for a botanick garden, but are plants of no use. The <span class="t8">cauliflowers</span> have, of late years, been so far improved in England, as to exceed, in goodness and magnitude, what are produced in most parts of Europe; and, by the skill of the gardners, are continued for several months together; but the most common season for them is in May, June, and July. <span class="t8">Miller.</span></p>

<p class="p32"><span class="t25">Cábbage tree</span>. <span class="t8">n.s.</span> A species of <span class="t8">palm-tree</span>; which see.</p>
<p class="p32">It is very common in the Caribee islands, where it grows to a prodigious height. The leaves of this tree envelope each other, so that those which are inclosed, being deprived of the air, are blanched; which is the part the inhabitants cut for plaits for hats, &amp;c. and the genuine, or young shoots, are pickled, and sent into England by the name of cabbage; but whenever this part is cut out, the trees are destroyed; nor do they rise again from the old roots; so that there are very few trees left remaining near plantations, except for ornament; for their stems being exceedingly straight, and their leaves being produced very regularly at top, will afford a most beautiful prospect; for which reason, the planters generally spare two or three of them near their habitations. <span class="t8">Miller</span>.</p>

<p class="p32">2. A plant.</p>
<p class="p32">It is very common in the South of France, Spain, and Italy, where it grows among corn, and on most of the arable land, and is very troublesome to the feet of cattle; for the fruit being armed with strong prickles, run into the feet of the cattle, which walk over the land. This is certainly the plant which is mentioned in Virgil&rsquo;s Georgick, under the name of <span class="t8">tribulus</span>. <span class="t8">Miller.</span></p>

One sort is large, and full of flesh, and fit to carry burdens of a thousand pounds weight, having one bunch upon its back. Another has two bunches upon their backs, like a natural saddle, and are fit either for burdens, or men to ride on. A third kind is leaner, and of a smaller size, called dromedaries, because of their swiftness; which are generally used for riding by men of quality. See Dromedary.</p>
<p class="p32"><span class="t8">Camels</span> have large solid feet, but not hard; in the spring, their hair falls entirely off, in less than three days time, when the flies are extremely uneasy to them. <span class="t8">Camels</span>, it is said, will continue ten or twelve days without eating or drinking, and keep water a long time in their stomach, for their refreshment. It is reported, that nature has furnished them, for this purpose, with a very large ventricle, with many bags closed within the coats of it, round about it, for reserving the water. But the Jesuits in China, where they dissected several <span class="t8">camels</span>, found no such bags. When a <span class="t8">camel</span> is upon a journey, his master follows him, singing and whistling; and the louder he sings, the better the <span class="t8">camel</span> goes. The flesh of <span class="t8">camels</span> is served up at the best tables, among the Arabians, Persians, and other eastern nations; but the use of it was forbid the Hebrews, they being ranked by Moses among the unclean creatures, <span class="t8">Deut</span>. xiv. 7. <span class="t8">Calmet.</span></p>

<p class="p32">The leaves are whole, and grow opposite by pairs upon the stalks; the cup of the flower is whole, and either tubulous or swelling; the flower consists of five leaves, which expand in form of a clove gilliflower, and are generally heartshaped; the ovary, which rises in the centre of the calyx, becomes a conical fruit, which is wrapt up in the flower cup, and has commonly one cell, filled with seeds, which are roundish, angular, and kidney-shaped. <span class="t8">Miller.</span></p>
