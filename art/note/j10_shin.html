<li>Note taken on <span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">[2023-04-19 Wed 19:37] </span></span> <br />
The method <code>run</code> in the thread should not be called manually. Calling

<li>Note taken on <span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">[2023-04-19 Wed 19:25] </span></span> <br />
You need to know that there is also a method called <code>run</code> inside of the thread class. However, one shall not define the <code>run</code> by
theire own in order to <i>decouple</i> the task from the thread that execute the task.</li>
</ul>

<p>
What is a thread? Threads are designed to be seperately executed to enhance performance. The difference between threads and
processes is that threads share same variables and memory, which might look pretty risky, but on the contrary, the exact feature
makes threads light weight.
</p>

<p>
On the first encounter, let us meet the class <code>bank</code>. It is a class defined by the author of the book to simulate a bank. Inside a
bank, there are some accounts. What <code>transfer</code> do is to transfer certain amount of money from one a count to the other.
</p>

<p>
Okay. We have the following code. 
</p>

<pre class="example">
public interface Runnable {
       void run();
}
</pre>

<p>
It is an interface. Yes. An interface. Why <code>Runnable</code>? You need to know that there is always a function named <code>run</code> to be executed by
the threads. What the interface does is only that the function <code>run</code> is in you class. Anyway, let us continue. 
</p>

<pre class="example">
Runnable r = () -&gt; {
         // code here.
}
</pre>

<p>
You just define a anomynous function using lambda expression. 
</p>

<pre class="example">
var t = new Thread(r);
</pre>

<p>
You just pass the <code>r</code> to a thread, and the thread is called <code>t</code> now. 
</p>

<pre class="example">
t.start();
</pre>

<p>
You just start the thread by calling the function named <code>start</code> inside the thread. 
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org8fa49ac" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org8fa49ac"><span class="section-number-2">2</span> States</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li class="off"><code>[&#xa0;]</code> the blocked waiting states</li>
<li class="off"><code>[&#xa0;]</code> runnable state</li>
</ul>

<p>
You should learn some words mentioned in the book:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><i>preempt</i>: The word "preempts" means to take action before someone else can, often by anticipating their actions or intentions. In
a military context, preemption refers to taking the initiative to attack an enemy before they can launch an attack of their own.</li>
<li><i>relinquish</i>: The word "relinquish" means to give up, surrender, or release something. It can refer to letting go of control,
ownership, or responsibility for something or someone. For example, a person may relinquish their rights to a property, relinquish
their position as the leader of a group, or relinquish custody of a child.</li>
<li><i>deprecated</i>: The word "deprecated" is used to describe something that has become outdated, no longer in use, or no longer
supported. It often refers to computer software or programming languages that have been replaced by newer versions or better
alternatives.</li>
</ul>

<p>
There are six states: 
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>New</li>
<li>Runnable</li>
<li>Blocked</li>
<li>Waiting</li>
<li>Timed waiting</li>
<li>Terminated</li>
</ol>

<p>
When a thread is <code>new</code>-ed, that is to say the thread is initialized, the state of the thread is at <i>new</i>. When one calls the
function <code>start</code>, the thread enters the <i>Runnable</i> state. It means that the thread can be runned (of course). 
</p>

<p>
To understand other states, we need to know what threads should be doing under certain circumstances.
</p>

<h3 id="org0254050"><span class="section-number-3">2.1</span> Blocked and Waiting states</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-1">
<p>
When the thread tries to acquire an intrinsic object lock that is currently held by another thread, it becomes blocked. It is easy
to understand. That is to say threads is requiring something, but the that thing is being occupied, so that the thread can't do
anything.

<li><i>propagate</i>: The word "propagate" generally means to spread or promote an idea, belief, or cause. It can also refer to the process
of reproducing plants or animals through various means such as seeds, cuttings, or cloning. In the context of computer networking,
it can refer to the distribution of data across a network.</li>

waiting for specific events or conditions to occur so that they can perform their tasks. Examples of daemons include system
processes such as network services, web servers, and print spoolers. Daemons are often used to provide essential services to other
programs and users without requiring constant attention or interaction.</li>

<h3 id="org4197cc4"><span class="section-number-3">4.1</span> Race Condition, First Encounter</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-1">
<p>
The main pointer of this section is to understand what is race condition and realize how a simple race condition can occurred. The
book provides an example of multiple threads being runned on the bank system to transfer money simultaneously, so that something
goes wrong, and is that the balance of the accounts (that is to say the total money) has been lowered. 
</p>

<p>
Why? Because the increment operations in the transfer function is a non-atomic operation, which can be decomposed as (more than)
three operations: 1. load; 2. add; 3. write back. When two increment operations take place simultaneously, in reality, the
atomic operations being carried out should be in a random order, like <code>1 2 1 2 3 3</code>. 
</p>

<h3 id="org6ef5fba"><span class="section-number-3">4.2</span> Lock Objects</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-2">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><i>reentrant</i>: In computer science and mathematics, "reentrant" typically refers to a program or subroutine that can be interrupted
in the middle of its execution and then safely called again before its previous execution has completed.</li>
<li><i>bypass</i>: "bypassed" means to avoid or skip over a particular section of code. A critical section is a portion of code that must
be executed atomically, meaning that it cannot be interrupted or accessed by other threads while it is running.</li>
</ul>

<p>
First thing first: <code>Synchronized</code> keyword is introduced after lock and condition are introduced, because <code>synchronized</code> keyword is
based on lock and condition. The author thinks that it is better to introduce lock and condition first. 
</p>

<p>
Next is the example. It is like you <code>lock</code> the thread and then proceed doing something critical and you don't want race condition
happens. After the critical part is done, you <code>unlock</code> the thread manually. The <code>lock</code> of the class have to be defined manually. 
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgee790c3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgee790c3"><span class="section-number-3">4.3</span> Conditioning Objects</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-3">
<p>
Say you are transferring money from one to the other. When there is not enough money in the account, we expect that the balance is
growing, for it it possible that other threads tranfer money to the account. So we wait, until the money is enough. This is the
<i>wait</i> state of the thread. A <i>waiting</i> thread can be <i>signal</i>-ed. It means that the thread can be back to work. When one thread
calls <code>signal()</code>, it <i>signal</i> one of the threads that is waiting. Next is the example.
</p>

<p>
You new a Condition in the class bank. It is called <code>sufficientFunds</code>. Like <code>transfer</code> function, it should be not carried if the
<code>amount</code> is less than the balance of the account. When this happens, the thread waits, the function <code>await()</code> is called. You need to
<code>signal</code> other thread that awaits, when the balance of an account is renewed. But, you don't know which thread is at this account,
so you use <code>signalAll</code> instead.
</p>

<p>
The difference between <i>block</i> and <i>wait</i> is that you can signal the thread that is waiting.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org81c7fa7" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org81c7fa7"><span class="section-number-3">4.4</span> Synchronized Keyword</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-4">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><i>notify</i>: To notify means to inform or give notice to someone about something. It can also imply giving a warning or alerting
someone about an important event or situation. For example, if your flight has been delayed, the airline may notify you by sending
you a text message or email to let you know about the delay.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The function of condition and lock is integrated. And the a function that is prefixed by the <code>synchronized</code> keyword works just like
that using <code>condition</code> and <code>lock</code>. 
</p>

<p>
First, it automatically employs the lock. The function is like: 
</p>
<pre class="example">
public synchronized void foo (){
       // code here
}
</pre>
<p>
And the code inside is equivalent to 
</p>
<pre class="example">
barLock.lock();
try {
    // code here
} finally {
  barLock.unlock();
}
</pre>
<p>
where the function is in the class <code>Bar</code>, where a lock object is defined, using following sentence: 
</p>
<pre class="example">
Lock barLock = new ReentrantLock();
</pre>

<p>
What about conditioning? 
</p>

<p>
When you want to use conditioning, you need to define the condition object in the class. But it is not necessary for synchronized
keyword already provides with you such thing. You may call <code>wait()</code> instead of <code>conditionObject.await()</code>, call <code>notifyAll()</code> instead
of <code>signalAll()</code>
</p>

<p>
When the synchronized keyword is prefixing a static method in a class, it would function differently. The <i>intrinsic lock</i> concerning
is the lock in the <i>class object</i>, but not the instance object.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><i>hijack</i>: The word "hijack" means to seize control of a vehicle, aircraft, or other conveyance while it is in transit, typically
with the intention of using it for an unlawful purpose. The term can also be used more broadly to refer to taking control of any
situation or process by force or deception.</li>
<li><i>ad hoc</i>: Ad hoc refers to something that is created or done for a particular purpose, often without prior planning or
preparation. It is typically used to describe a solution or approach that is improvised or temporary, rather than being part of a
formal or long-term strategy. For example, an ad hoc committee may be formed to address a specific issue or problem, or an ad hoc
decision may be made in response to a sudden change in circumstances. The term can also refer to computer systems or software that
are designed to perform a specific task on an as-needed basis, rather than being part of a larger, more integrated system.</li>
<li><i>mutator</i>: Mutator methods are methods that modify the internal state of an object. In other words, they change the values of the
object's fields or properties. In the context of the Vector class, mutator methods are methods that modify the elements stored in
a vector. For example, the <code>set()</code> method is a mutator method because it modifies the value of a vector element at a specific index.</li>

<h4 id="orgf0ce081"><span class="section-number-4">4.5.1</span> Main Idea</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-4-5-1">
<p>
You may arbitrarily lock an <i>object</i> using <i>synchronized</i> keyword. For example, <code>synchronized(obj) { // your code here}</code> will lock
the <code>obj</code> in the thread. It is more flexible than just prefixing the synchronized keyword to method. 
</p>

<p>
<code>obj</code> should be an object. It can be an <i>ad hoc</i> object. 
</p>

<pre class="example">
private Lock lock = new Object();
public void foo (){
       // some code 
       synchronized (lock) {
                    // critical code here
       }
       // other code
}
</pre>

<p>
If the method is static, one shall lock <code>Myclass.class</code> which is the class object. Don't lock <code>getClass()</code>, because for different
instances, the return values of the <code>getClass()</code> are different.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-6">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><i>scathing</i>: The term "scathing" is generally used to describe something that is very critical or harsh. For example, if someone
were to write a scathing review of a book, they would be writing a review that is extremely negative and condemning.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<i>Monitor</i> Concept is for <i>Object-Oriented</i> Programming. 
</p>

<p>
A monitor has these properties: 
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>A monitor is a class with only private fields</li>
<li>Each object of the class has an associated lock</li>
<li>All the methods are locked by the lock.</li>
<li>The lock have number of conditions.</li>
</ol>

<p>
<i>Synchronized</i> keyword makes a class can work like a monitor, but there are differences. 
</p>

<p>
Anyway,the question is why <i>synchronized</i> keyword is not safe enough.

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><i>Volatile</i>: In general usage, "volatile" can refer to something that is likely to change suddenly and unexpectedly, or someone who
has a tendency to become angry or emotional very quickly.</li>
</ul>

<p>
What problems occur, when it comes to 
</p>

<p>
When <i>Volatile</i> keyword is prefixing a variable, the variable is then marked as the variable that can be changed concurrently, which
means that the variable can be changed by other threads. The keyword tells Java Compiler to deal with this problem. 
</p>


<p>
Cautions!: 
</p>

<p>
Volatile variables do not provide any atomicity. For example, the method
</p>
<pre class="example">
public void flipDone() { done = !done; } // not atomic
</pre>
<p>
is not guaranteed to flip the value of the field. There is no guarantee that the reading, flipping, and writing is uninterrupted.</p>
