<p class="p24">(392) Most of the notes which the present editor has subjoined to this play were published by him in a small pamphlet in 1745.</p>
<p class="p24">I.i (393,*) <span class="t8">Enter three Witches</span>] In order to make a true estimate of the abilities and merit of a writer, it it always necessary to examine the genius of his age, and the opinions of his contemporaries. A poet who should now make the whole action of his tragedy depend upon enchantment, and produce the chief events by the assistance of supernatural agents, would be censured as transgressing the bounds of probability, be banished from the theatre to the nursery, and condemned to write fairy tales instead of tragedies; but a survey of the notions that prevailed at the time when this play was written, will prove that Shakespeare was in no danger of such censures, since he only turned the system that was then universally admitted, to his advantage, and was far from overburthening the credulity of his audience.</p>
<p class="p24">The reality of witchcraft or enchantment, which, though not strictly the same, are confounded in this play, has in all ages and countries been credited by the common people, and in most, by the learned themselves. These phantoms have indeed appeared more frequently, in proportion as the darkness of ignorance has been more gross; but it cannot be shown, that the brightest gleams of knowledge have at any time been sufficient to drive them out of the world. The time in which this kind of credulity was at its height, seems to have been that of the holy war, in which the Christians imputed all their defeats to enchantments or diabolical opposition, as they ascribed their success to the assistance of their military saints; and the learned Dr. Warburton appears to believe (<span class="t8">Suppl. to the Introduction to Don Quixote</span>) that the first accounts of enchantments were brought into this part of the world by those <span class="t8">who</span> returned from their eastern expeditions. But there is always some distance between the birth and maturity of folly as of wickedness: this opinion had long existed, though perhaps the application of it had in no foregoing age been so frequent, nor the reception so general. Olympiodorus, in Photius&rsquo;s extracts, tells us of one Libanius, who practised this kind of military magic, and having promised [Greek: choris opliton kata barbaron energein] to perform great things against the Barbarians without soldiers, was, at the instances of the empress Placidia, put to death, when he was about to have given proofs of his abilities. The empress shewed some kindness in her anger by cutting him off at a time so convenient for his reputation.</p>
<p class="p24">But a more remarkable proof of the antiquity of this notion may be found in St. Chrysostom&rsquo;s book <span class="t8">de Sacerdotia</span>, which exhibits a scene of enchantments not exceeded by any romance of the middle age: he supposes a spectator overlooking a field of battle attended by one that points out all the various objects of horror, the engines of destruction, and the arts of slaughter. [Greek: Deichnuto de eti para tois enantiois kai petomenous hippous dia tinos magganeias, kai oplitas di&rsquo; aeros pheromenous, kai pasaen goaeteias dunomin kai idean.] <span class="t8">Let him then proceed to shew him in the opposite armies horses flying by enchantment, armed men transported through the air, and every power and form of magic.</span> Whether St. Chrysostom believed that such performances were really to be seen in a day of battle, or only endeavoured to enliven his description, by adopting the notions of the vulgar, it is equally certain, that such nations were in his time received, and that therefore they were not imported from the Saracens in a later age; the wars with the Saracens however gave occasion to their propagation, not only as bigotry naturally discovers prodigies, but as the scene of action was removed to a great distance.</p>
<p class="p24">The Reformation did not immediately arrive at its meridian, and though day was gradually encreasing upon us, the goblins of witchcraft still continued to hover in the twilight. In the time of queen Elizabeth was the remarkable trial of the witches of Warbois, whose conviction is still commemorated in an annual sermon at Huntingdon. But in the reign of king James, in which this tragedy was written, many circumstances concurred to propagate and confirm this opinion. The king, who was much celebrated for his knowledge, had, before his arrival in England, not only examined in person a woman accused of witchcraft, but had given a very formal account of the practices and illusions of evil spirits, the compacts of witches, the ceremonies used by them, the manner of detecting them, and the justice of punishing them, in his dialogues of <span class="t8">Daemonologie</span>, written in the Scottish dialect, and published at Edinburgh. This book was, soon after his accession, reprinted at London, and as the ready way to gain king James&rsquo;s favour was to flatter his speculations, the system of <span class="t8">Daemonologie</span> was immediately adopted by all who desired either to gain preferment or not to lose it. Thus the doctrine of witchcraft was very powerfully inculcated; and as the greatest part of mankind have no other reason for their opinions than that they are in fashion, it cannot be doubted but this persuasion made a rapid progress, since vanity and credulity co-operated in its favour. The infection soon reached the parliament, who, in the first year of king James, made a law, by which it was enacted, chap. xii. &ldquo;That if any person shall use any invocation or conjuration of any evil or wicked spirit; 2. or shall consult, covenant with, entertain, employ, feed or reward any evil or cursed spirit to or for any intent or purpose; 3. or take up any dead man, woman or child out of the grave, &mdash; or the skin, bone, or any part of the dead person, to be employed or used in any manner of witchcraft, sorcery, charm, or enchantment; 4. or shall use, practise or exercise any sort of witchcraft, sorcery, charm, or enchantment; 5. whereby any person shall be destroyed, killed, wasted, consumed, pined, or lamed in any part of the body; 6. That every such person being convicted shall suffer death.&rdquo; This law was repealed in our own time.</p>
<p class="p24">Thus, in the time of Shakespeare, was the doctrine of witchcraft at once established by law and by the fashion, and it became not only unpolite, but criminal, to doubt it; and as prodigies are always seen in proportion as they are expected, witches were every day discovered, and multiplied as fast in some places, that bishop Hall mentions a village in Lancashire, where their number was greater than that of the houses. The jesuits and sectaries took advantage of this universal error, and endeavoured to promote the interest of their parties by pretended cures of persons afflicted by evil spirits; but they were detected and exposed by the clergy of the established church.</p>
<p class="p24">Upon this general infatuation Shakespeare might be easily allowed to found a play, especially since he has followed with great exactness such histories as were then thought true; nor can it be doubted that the scenes of enchantment, however they may now be ridiculed, were both by himself and his audience thought awful and affecting.</p>
<p class="p24">I.i.10 (396,5) Fair is foul, and foul is fair] I believe the meaning is, that <span class="t8">to us</span>, perverse and malignant as we are, <span class="t8">fair is foul, and foul is fair</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">I.ii.14 (398,9) And Fortune, on his damned quarry smiling] Thus the old copy; but I am inclined to read <span class="t8">quarrel</span>. <span class="t8">Quarrel</span> was formerly used for <span class="t8">cause</span>, or for <span class="t8">the occasion of a quarrel</span>, and is to be found in that sense in Hollingshed&rsquo;s account of the story of Macbeth, who, upon the creation of the prince of Cumberland, thought, says the historian, that he had <span class="t8">a just quarrel</span>, to endeavour after the crown. The sense therefore is, <span class="t8">Fortune smiling on his excrable cause</span>, &amp;c. This is followed by Dr. Warburten. (see 1765, VI, 373, 4).</p>
<p class="p24">I.ii.28 (400,4) Discomfort swells] <span class="t8">Discomfort</span> the natural opposite to <span class="t8">comfort</span>. <span class="t8">Well&rsquo;d</span>, for <span class="t8">flawed</span>, was an emendation. The common copies have, <span class="t8">discomfort swells</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">I.ii.37 (400,5) As cannons overcharg&rsquo;d with double cracks,</p>
<p class="p24">So they</p>
<p class="p24">Doubly redoubled strokes upon the foe]</p>
<p class="p24">Mr. Theobald has endeavoured to improve the sense of this passage by altering the punctuation thus:</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&mdash; <span class="t8">they were</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">As cannons overcharg&rsquo;d, with double cracks</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">So they redoubled strokes</span> &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">He declares, with some degree of exultation, that he has no idea of a <span class="t8">cannon charged with double cracks</span>; but surely the great author will not gain much by an alteration which makes him say of a hero, that he <span class="t8">redoubles strokes with double cracks</span>, an expression not more loudly to be applauded, or more easily pardoned than that which is rejected in its favour. That a cannon is charged <span class="t8">with thunder</span>, or <span class="t8">with double thunders</span>, may be written, not only without nonsense, but with elegance, and nothing else is here meant by <span class="t8">cracks</span>, which in the time of this writer was a word of such emphasis and dignity, that in this play he terms the general dissolution of nature the <span class="t8">crack of doom</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">The old copy reads,</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">They doubly redoubled strokes</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">I.ii.46 (401,8) So should he look, that seems to speak things strange] The meaning of this passage, as it now stands, is, <span class="t8">so should he look, that looks as if he told things strange</span>. But Rosse neither yet told strange things, nor could look as if he told them; Lenox only conjectured from his air that he had strange things to tell, and therefore undoubtedly said,</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">What haste looks thro&rsquo; his eyes?</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">So should he look, that</span> teems <span class="t8">to speak thinks strange</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">He looks like one that <span class="t8">is big with</span> something of importance; a metaphor so natural that it is every day used in common discourse.</p>
<p class="p24">I.ii.55 (402,1) Confronted him with self-comparisons] [Theobald interpreted &ldquo;him&rdquo; as Cawdor; Johnson, in 1745, accused Shakespeare of forgetfulness on the basis of Theobald&rsquo;s error; and Warburton here speaks of &ldquo;blunder upon blunder.&rdquo;] The second blunderer was the present editor.</p>
<p class="p24">I.iii.6 (403,5) <span class="t8">Aroint thee, witch</span>!] In one of the folio editions the reading is <span class="t8">Anoint thee</span>, in a sense very consistent with the common accounts of witches, who are related to perform many supernatural acts by the means of unguents, and particularly to fly through the air to the places where they meet at their hellish festivals. In this sense, <span class="t8">anoint thee, Witch</span>, will mean, <span class="t8">Away, Witch, to your infernal assembly</span>. This reading I was inclined to favour, because I had met with the word <span class="t8">aroint</span> in no other authour till looking into Hearne&rsquo;s Collections I found it in a very old drawing, that he has published, in which St. Patrick is represented visiting hell, and putting the devils into great confusion by his presence, of whom one that is driving the damned before him with a prong, has a label issuing out of his mouth with these words, OUT OUT ARONGT, of which the last is evidently the same with <span class="t8">aroint</span>, and used in the same sense as in this passage.</p>
<p class="p24">I.iii.15 (405,8) And the very points they blew] As the word <span class="t8">very</span> is here of no other use than to fill up the verse, it is likely that Shakespeare wrote <span class="t8">various</span>, which might be easily mistaken for <span class="t8">very</span>, being either negligently read, hastily pronounced, or imperfectly heard.</p>
<p class="p24">I.iii.21 (405,9) He shall live a man forbid] Mr. Theobald has very justly explained <span class="t8">forbid</span> by <span class="t8">accursed</span>, but without giving any reason of his interpretation.</p>
<p class="p24">As to <span class="t8">forbid</span> therefore implies to <span class="t8">prohibit</span>, in opposition to the word <span class="t8">bid</span> in its present sense, it signifies by the same kind of opposition to <span class="t8">curse</span>, when it is derived from the same word in its primitive meaning.</p>
<p class="p24">I.iii.42 (409,3) are you aught/That man may question?] Are ye any beings with which man is permitted to hold converse, or of which it is lawful <span class="t8">to ask questions</span>?</p>
<p class="p24">I.iii.53 (410,5) Are ye fantastical] By <span class="t8">fantastical</span>, he means creatures of fantasy or imagination; the question is, Are these real beings before us, or are we deceived by illusions of fancy?</p>
<p class="p24">I.iii.97 (412,8) As thick as tale] [As thick as hail] Was Mr. Pope&rsquo;s correction. The old copy has,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&mdash; <span class="t8">As thick</span> as tale</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Can</span> post <span class="t8">with</span> post; &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">which perhaps is not amiss, meaning that the news came as <span class="t8">thick</span> as a <span class="t8">tale</span> can <span class="t8">travel</span> with the <span class="t8">post</span>. Or we may read, perhaps yet better,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&mdash; <span class="t8">As thick as tale</span></p>
<p class="p24">Came <span class="t8">post with post</span>; &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">That is, posts arrived as fast as they could be counted.</p>
<p class="p24">I.iii.130 (414,4) This supernatural solliciting] <span class="t8">Solliciting</span> is rather, in my opinion, <span class="t8">incitement</span> than <span class="t8">information</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">I.iii.134 (414,5) why do I yield] To <span class="t8">yield</span> is, simply, to <span class="t8">give way to</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">I.iii.137 (414,6) Present fears/Are less than horrible imaginings] [W: feats] <span class="t8">Present fears</span> are <span class="t8">fears of things present</span>, which Macbeth declares, and every man has found, to be less than the <span class="t8">imagination</span> presents them while the objects are yet distant. <span class="t8">Fears</span> is right.</p>
<p class="p24">I.iii.140 (415,7) single state of man] The <span class="t8">single state of man</span> seems to be used by Shakespeare for an <span class="t8">individual</span>, in opposition to a <span class="t8">commonwealth</span>, or <span class="t8">conjunct body</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">I.iii.40 (415,8) function/Is smother&rsquo;d in surmise; and nothing is,/ But what is not] All powers of action are oppressed and crushed by one overwhelming image in the mind, and nothing is present to me, but that which is really future. Of things now about me I have no perception, being intent wholly on that which has yet no existence.</p>
<p class="p24">I.iii.147 (415,9) Time and the hour runs through the roughest day] I suppose every reader is disgusted at the tautology in this passage, <span class="t8">Time and the hour</span>, and will therefore willingly believe that Shakespeare wrote it thus,</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Come what come may</span>,</p>
<p class="p24">Time! on! &mdash; <span class="t8">the hour runs thro&rsquo; the roughest day</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">Macbeth is deliberating upon the events which are to befall him, but finding no satisfaction from his own thoughts, he grows impatient of reflection, and resolves to wait the close without harrassing hinaelf with conjectures.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Come what come may</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">But to shorten the pain of suspense, he calls upon Time In the usual stile of ardent desire, to quicken his motion,</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Time! on!</span> &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">He then comforts himself with the reflection that all his perplexity must have an end,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&mdash; <span class="t8">the hour runs thro&rsquo; the roughest day.</span></p>
<p class="p24">This conjecture is supported by the passage in the letter to his lady, in which he says, <span class="t8">they referred me to the</span> coming on of time, <span class="t8">with Hail, King that shalt be</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">I.iii.149 (416,1) My dull brain was wrought] My head was <span class="t8">worked</span>, <span class="t8">agitated</span>, put into commotion.</p>
<p class="p24">I.iv.9 (417,3) studied in his death] Instructed in the art of dying. It was usual to say <span class="t8">studied</span>, for <span class="t8">learned</span> in science.</p>
<p class="p24">I.iv.12 (417,4) To find the mind&rsquo;s construction in the face] The <span class="t8">construction of the mind</span> is, I believe, a phrase peculiar to Shakespeare; it implies the <span class="t8">frame</span> or <span class="t8">disposition</span> of the mind, by which it is determined to good or ill.</p>
<p class="p24">I.iv.26 (418,5) Which do but what they should, by doing everything, Safe toward your love and honour] Of the last line of this speech, which is certainly, as it is now read, unintelligible, an emendation has been attempted, which Dr. Warburton and Dr. Theobald once admitted as the true reading:</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&mdash; <span class="t8">our duties</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Are to your throne and state, children and servants,</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Which do but what they should, in doing every thing</span></p>
<p class="p24">Fiefs <span class="t8">to your love and honour.</span></p>
<p class="p24">My esteem for these critics inclines me to believe that they cannot be much pleased with these expressions <span class="t8">fiefs to love</span>, or <span class="t8">fiefs to honour</span>, and that they have proposed this alteration rather because no other occured to them, than because they approved of it. I shall therefore propose a bolder change, perhaps with no better success, but <span class="t8">sua cuique placent</span>. I read thus,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&mdash; <span class="t8">our duties</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Are to your throne and state, children and servants</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Which do but what they should, in doing</span> nothing,</p>
<p class="p24">Save <span class="t8">toward</span> your love and honour.</p>
<p class="p24">We do but perform our duty when we contract all our views to your service, when we act with <span class="t8">no other</span> principle than regard to <span class="t8">your love and honour</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">It is probable that this passage was first corrupted by writing <span class="t8">safe</span> for <span class="t8">save</span>, and the lines then stood thus:</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&mdash; <span class="t8">doing nothing</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Safe toward your love and honour.</span></p>
<p class="p24">which the next transcriber observing to be wrong, and yet not being able to discover the real fault, altered to the present reading.</p>
<p class="p24">Dr. Warburton has since changed <span class="t8">fiefs</span> to <span class="t8">fief&rsquo;d</span>, and Hanmer has altered <span class="t8">safe</span> to <span class="t8">shap&rsquo;d</span>. I am afraid none of us have hit the right word.</p>
<p class="p24">I.v.2 (420, 6) <span class="t8">by the perfected report</span>] By the best intelligence. Dr. Warburton would read, <span class="t8">perfected</span>, and explains <span class="t8">report</span> by <span class="t8">prediction</span>. Little regard can be paid to an emendation that instead of clearing the sense, makes it more difficult.</p>
<p class="p24">I.v.23 (420, 7) thoud&rsquo;st have, great Glamis,/That which cries, <span class="t8">Thus thou must do, if thou have it</span>] As the object of Macbeth&rsquo;s desire is here introduced speaking of itself, it is necessary to read,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&mdash; <span class="t8">thoud&rsquo;st have, great Glamis,</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">That which cries</span>, thus thou must do, if thou have <span class="t8">me</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">I.v.39 (422, 8) The raven himself is hoarse] Dr. Warburton reads,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&mdash; <span class="t8">The raven himself&rsquo;s</span> not <span class="t8">hoarse</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">Yet I think the present words may stand. The messenger, says the servant, had hardly breath <span class="t8">to make up his message</span>; to which the lady answers mentally, that he may well want breath, such a message would add hoarseness to the raven. That even the bird, whose harsh voice is accustomed to predict calamities, could not <span class="t8">croak the entrance of</span> Duncan but in a note of unwonted harshness.</p>
<p class="p24">I.v.42 (422, 2) mortal thoughts] This expression signifies not <span class="t8">the thoughts of mortals</span>, but <span class="t8">murtherous, deadly</span>, or <span class="t8">destructive designs</span>. So in act 5,</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Hold fast the</span> mortal <span class="t8">sword</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">And in another place,</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">With twenty</span> mortal <span class="t8">murthers</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">I.v.47 (422, 3) nor keep peace between/The effect, and it!] The intent of lady Macbeth evidently is to wish that no womanish tenderness, or conscientious remorse, may hinder her purpose from proceeding to effect; but neither this, nor indeed any other sense, is expressed by the present reading, and therefore it cannot be doubted that Shakespeare wrote differently, perhaps thus,</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">That no compunctious visitings of nature</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Shake my fell purpose, nor keep</span> pace <span class="t8">between</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Th&rsquo; effect, and it</span>. &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">To <span class="t8">keep</span> pace <span class="t8">between</span> may signify <span class="t8">to pass between</span>, to <span class="t8">intervene</span>. <span class="t8">Pace</span> is on many occasions a favourite of Shakespeare&rsquo;s. This phrase is indeed not usual in this sease, but was it not its novelty that gave occasion to the present corruption? [The sense is, <span class="t8">that no compunctious visitings of nature</span> may prevail upon her, to give place in her mind to <span class="t8">peaceful</span> thoughts, or to rest one moment in quiet, from the hour of her purpose to its full completion in the effect. REVISAL.] This writer thought himself perhaps very sagacious that be found a meaning which nobody missed, the difficulty still remains how such a meaning is made by the words. (see 1765, VI, 394, 6)</p>
<p class="p24">I.v.49 (423, 5) take my milk for gall] <span class="t8">Take</span> away <span class="t8">my milk</span>, and put <span class="t8">gall</span> into the place.</p>
<p class="p24">I.v.51 (423, 6) You wait on nature&rsquo;s mischief!] <span class="t8">Nature&rsquo;s mischief</span> is mischief done to nature, violation of nature&rsquo;s order committed by wickedness.</p>
<p class="p24">I.v.55 (423,8) To cry, <span class="t8">hold, hold</span>!] On this passage there is a long criticism in the <span class="t8">Rambler</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">I.v.58 (424,1) This ignorant present time] <span class="t8">Ignorant</span> has here the signification of <span class="t8">unknowing</span>; that it, I feel by anticipation these future hours, of which, according to the process of nature, the present time would be <span class="t8">ignorant</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">I.vi.3 (425,3) our gentle senses] <span class="t8">Senses</span> are nothing more <span class="t8">than each man&rsquo;s sense</span>. <span class="t8">Gentle senses</span> is very elegant, as it means <span class="t8">placid</span>, <span class="t8">calm</span>, <span class="t8">composed</span>, and intimates the peaceable delight of a fine day. (see 1765, VI,396,2)</p>
<p class="p24">I.vi.7 (426,5) coigne of &lsquo;vantage] Convenient corner.</p>
<p class="p24">I.vi.13 (426,7) How you should bid god-yield as for your pains] I believe <span class="t8">yield</span>, or, as it is in the folio of 1623, <span class="t8">eyld</span>, is a corrupted contraction of <span class="t8">shield</span>. The wish implores not <span class="t8">reward</span> but <span class="t8">protection</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">I.vii.1 (428,1) If it were <span class="t8">done</span>] A man of learning recommends another punctuation:</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">If it were done, when &rsquo;tis done, then &lsquo;twere well.</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">It were done quickly, if, &amp;c.</span></p>
<p class="p24">I.vii.2 (428,2) If the assassination/Could tramel up the consequence] Of this soliloquy the meaning is not very clear; I have never found the readers of Shakespeare agreeing about it. I understand it thus,</p>
<p class="p24">&ldquo;If that which I am about to do, when it is once <span class="t8">done</span> and executed, were <span class="t8">done</span> and ended without any following effects, it would then be best <span class="t8">to do it quickly</span>; if the murder could terminate in itself, and restrain the regular course of consequences, if <span class="t8">its success</span> could secure <span class="t8">its surcease</span>, if being once done <span class="t8">successfully</span>, without detection, it could <span class="t8">fix a period</span> to all vengeance and enquiry, so that <span class="t8">this blow</span> might be all that I have to do, and this anxiety all that I have to suffer; if this could be my condition, even <span class="t8">here</span> in <span class="t8">this world</span>, in this contracted period of temporal existence, on this narrow <span class="t8">bank</span> in the ocean of eternity, <span class="t8">I would jump the life to come</span>, I would venture upon the deed without care of any future state. But this is one of <span class="t8">these cases</span> in which judgment is pronounced and vengeance inflicted upon as <span class="t8">here</span> in our present life. We teach others to do as we have done, and are punished by our own example.&rdquo; (1773)</p>
<p class="p24">I.vii.4 (428,3) With his surcease, success] I think the reasoning requires that we should read,</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">With its</span> success surcease.</p>
<p class="p24">I.vii.6 (429,4) shoal of time] This is Theobald&rsquo;s emendation, undoubtedly right. The old edition has <span class="t8">school</span>, and Dr. Warburton <span class="t8">shelve</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">I.vii.22 (429,7) or heavens cherubin, hors&rsquo;d/Upon the sightless couriers of the air] [W: couriers] <span class="t8">Courier</span> is only <span class="t8">runner</span>. <span class="t8">Couriers of air</span> are <span class="t8">winds</span>, air in motion. <span class="t8">Sightless</span> is <span class="t8">invisible</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">I.vii.25 (430,8) That tears shall drown the wind] Alluding to the remission of the wind in a shower.</p>
<p class="p24">I.vii.28 (430,9) <span class="t8">Enter Lady</span>] The arguments by which lady Macbeth persuades her husband to commit the murder, afford a proof of Shakespeare&rsquo;s knowledge of human nature. She urges the excellence and dignity of courage, a glittering idea which has dazzled mankind from age to age, and animated sometimes the house-breaker, and sometimes the conqueror; but this sophism Macbeth has for ever destroyed, by distinguishing true from false fortitude, in a line and a half; of which it may almost be said, that they ought to bestow immortality on the author, though all his other productions had been lost:</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">I dare do all that become a man,</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Who dares do more, is none</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">This topic, which has been always employed with too much success, is used in this scene with peculiar propriety, to a soldier by a woman. Courage is the distinguishing virtue of a soldier, and the reproach of cowardice cannot be borne by any man from a woman, without great impatience.</p>
<p class="p24">She then urges the oaths by which he had bound himself to murder Duncan, another art of sophistry by which men have sometimes deluded their consciences, and persuaded themselves that what would be criminal in others is virtuous in them; this argument Shakespeare, whose plan obliged him to make Macbeth yield, has not confuted, though he might easily have shewn that a former obligation could not be vacated by a latter: that obligations laid on us by a higher power, could not be over-ruled by obligations which we lay upon ourselves.</p>
<p class="p24">I.vii.41 (431,1)</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&mdash; Whouldst thou have that,</p>
<p class="p24">Which then esteem&rsquo;st the ornament of life,</p>
<p class="p24">And live a coward in thine own esteem?]</p>
<p class="p24">In this there seems to be no reasoning. I should read,</p>
<p class="p24">Or <span class="t8">live a coward in thine own esteem</span>?</p>
<p class="p24">Unless we choose rather,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&mdash; <span class="t8">Wouldst thou</span> leave <span class="t8">that</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">I.vii.45 (431,2) Like the poor cat i&rsquo; the adage?] The adage alluded to is, <span class="t8">The cat loves fish, but dares not wet her feet, Catus amat pisces, sed men vult tingere plantas</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">I.vii.64 (432,5) Will I with wine and wassel so convince] To <span class="t8">convince</span> is in Shakespeare to <span class="t8">overpower</span> or <span class="t8">subdue</span>, as in this play,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&mdash; <span class="t8">Their malady</span> convinces</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">The great assay of art</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">I.vii.67 (433,6) A limbeck only] That is, shall be only a vessel to emit <span class="t8">fumes</span> or <span class="t8">vapours</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">I.vii.71 (433,7) our great quell] <span class="t8">Quell</span> is <span class="t8">murder</span>. <span class="t8">manquellers</span> being in the old language the term for which <span class="t8">murderers</span> is now used.</p>
<p class="p24">II.i (434,8) <span class="t8">Enter Banquo, and Fleance with a torch before him</span>] The place is not mark&rsquo;d in the old edition, nor is it easy to say where this encounter can be. It is not in the <span class="t8">hall</span>, as the editors have all supposed it, for Banquo sees the sky; it is not far from the bedchamber, as the conversation shews: it must be in the inner court of the castle, which Banquo might properly cross in his way to bed.</p>
<p class="p24">II.i.25 (435,2) If you shall cleave to my consent, Then &rsquo;tis,/It shall make honour for you] Macbeth expressed his thought with affected obscurity; he does not mention the royalty, though he apparently has it in his mind, <span class="t8">If you shall cleave to my consent</span>, if you shall concur with me when I determine to accept the crown, <span class="t8">when &rsquo;tis</span>, when that happens which the prediction promises, <span class="t8">it shall make honour for you</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">II.i.49 (437,6) Now o&rsquo;er the one half world/Nature seems dead] That is, <span class="t8">over our hemisphere all action and motion seem to have ceased</span>. This image, which is perhaps the most striking that poetry can produce, has been adopted by Dryden in his <span class="t8">Conquest of Mexico</span>:</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">All things are hush&rsquo;d as Nature&rsquo;s self lay dead,</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">The mountains seem to nod their drowsy head;</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">The little birds in dreams their song repeat,</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">And sleeping flow&rsquo;rs beneath the night dews sweat.</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Even lust and envy sleep!</span></p>
<p class="p24">These lines, though so well known, I have transcribed, that the contrast between them and this passage of Shakespeare may be more accurately observed.</p>
<p class="p24">Night is described by two great poets, but one describes a night of quiet, the other of perturbation. In the night of Dryden, all the disturbers of the world are laid asleep; in that of Shakespeare, nothing but sorcery, lust, and murder, is awake. He that reads Dryden, finds himself lull&rsquo;d with serenity, and disposed to solitude and contemplation. He that peruses Shakspeare looks round alarmed, and starts to find himself alone. One is the night of a lover, the other, of a murderer.</p>
<p class="p24">II.i.52 (438,8)</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&mdash; wither&rsquo;d Murther,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&mdash; thus with hia stealthy pace,</p>
<p class="p24">With Tarquin&rsquo;s ravishing strides, tow&rsquo;rds his design</p>
<p class="p24">moves like a ghost. &mdash; ]</p>
<p class="p24">This was the reading of this passage [ravishing sides] in all the editions before that of Mr. Pope, who for <span class="t8">sides</span>, inserted in the text <span class="t8">strides</span>, which Mr. Theobald has tacitly copied from him, though a more proper alteration might perhaps have been made. A <span class="t8">ravishing stride</span> is an action of violence, impetuosity, and tumult, like that of a savage rushing at his prey; whereas the poet is here attempting to exhibit an image of secrecy and caution, of anxious circumspection and guilty timidity, the <span class="t8">stealthy pace</span> of a <span class="t8">ravisher</span> creeping into the chamber of a virgin, and of an assassin approaching the bed of him whom he proposes to murder, without awaking him; these he describes as <span class="t8">moving like ghosts</span>, whose progression is so different from <span class="t8">strides</span>, that it has been in all ages represented te be, as Milton expresses it,</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Smooth sliding without step</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">This hemiatic will afford the true reading of this place, which is, I think, to be corrected thus:</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&mdash; <span class="t8">and wither&rsquo;d Murder</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&mdash; <span class="t8">thus with his</span> stealthy <span class="t8">pace</span>.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">With Tarquin ravishing</span>, slides <span class="t8">tow&rsquo;rds his design</span>,</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Moves like a ghost</span>. &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Tarquin</span> is in this place the general name of a ravisher, and the sense is, Now is the time in which every one is a-sleep, but those who are employed in wickedness; the witch who is sacrificing to Hecate, and the ravisher, and the murderer, who, like me, are stealing upon their prey.</p>
<p class="p24">When the reading is thus adjusted, he wishes with great propriety, in the following lines, that the <span class="t8">earth</span> may not <span class="t8">hear his steps</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">II.i.59 (439,3) And take the present horrour from the time,/Which now suits with it] Of this passage an alteration was once proposed by me, of which I have now a less favourable opinion, yet will insert it, as it may perhaps give some hint to other critics:</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">And take the present horrour from the time,</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Which now suits with it</span>. &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">I believe every one that has attentively read this dreadful soliloquy is disappointed at the conclusion, which, if not wholly unintelligible, is, at least, obscure, nor can be explained into any sense worthy of the authour. I shall therefore propose a slight alteration:</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&mdash; <span class="t8">Thou sound and firm-set earth,</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Hear not my steps, which way they walk, for fear</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Thy very stones prate of my where-about,</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">And talk &mdash; the present horrour of the time!</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">That now suits with it</span>. &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">Macbeth has, in the foregoing lines, disturbed his imagination by enumerating all the terrors of the night; at length he is wrought up to a degree of frenzy, that makes him afraid of some supernatural discovery of his design, and calls out to the stones not to betray him, not to declare where he walks, nor <span class="t8">to talk</span>. &mdash; As he is going to say of what, he discovers the absurdity of his suspicion, and pauses, but is again overwhelmed by his guilt, and concludes, that such are the horrors of the present night, that the stones may be expected to cry out against him:</p>
<p class="p24">That <span class="t8">now suits with it</span>. &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">He observes in a subsequent passage, that on such occasions <span class="t8">stones have been known to move</span>. It is now a very just and strong picture of a man about to commit a deliberate murder under the strongest conviction of the wickedness of his design. Of this alteration, however, I do not now see much use, and certainly see no necessity.</p>
<p class="p24">Whether to <span class="t8">take horrour from the time</span> means not rather to <span class="t8">catch</span> <span class="t8">it</span> as communicated, than to <span class="t8">deprive the time of horrour</span>, deserves te be considered.</p>
<p class="p24">II.ii.37 (443,6) sleave of care] A skein of silk is called a <span class="t8">sleave</span> of silk, as I learned from Mr. Seward, the ingenious editor of Beaumont and Fletcher.</p>
<p class="p24">II.ii.56 (444,8) gild the faces of the grooms withal,/For it must seem their guilt] Could Shakespeare possibly mean to play upon the similitude of <span class="t8">gild</span> and <span class="t8">guilt</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">II.iii.45 (447,5) I made a shift to cast him] To <span class="t8">cast him up</span>, to ease my stomach of him. The equivocation is between <span class="t8">cast</span> or <span class="t8">throw</span>, as a term of wrestling, and <span class="t8">cast</span> or <span class="t8">cast up</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">II.iii.61 (448,7)</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&mdash; strange screams of death;</p>
<p class="p24">And prophesying, with accents terrible</p>
<p class="p24">Of dire combustions, and confus&rsquo;d events,</p>
<p class="p24">New hatch&rsquo;d to the woeful time: The obscure bird</p>
<p class="p24">Clamour&rsquo;d the live-long night: some say the earth</p>
<p class="p24">Was feverous, and did shake]</p>
<p class="p24">Those lines I think should be rather regulated thus:</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&mdash; <span class="t8">prophecying with accents terrible,</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Of dire combustions and cosfus&rsquo;d events.</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">New-hatch&rsquo;d to th&rsquo; woful time, the obscure bird</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Clamour&rsquo;d the live-long night. Some say the earth</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Was fev&rsquo;rous and did shake.</span></p>
<p class="p24">A <span class="t8">prophecy</span> of an <span class="t8">event new hatch&rsquo;d</span>, seems to be a <span class="t8">prophecy</span> of an <span class="t8">event past</span>. And <span class="t8">a prophecy new hatch&rsquo;d</span> is a wry expression. The term <span class="t8">new hatch&rsquo;d</span> is properly applicable to a <span class="t8">bird</span>, and that birds of ill omen should be <span class="t8">new-hatch&rsquo;d to the woful time</span>, that is, should appear in uncommon numbers, is very consistent with the rest of the prodigies here mentioned, and with the universal disorder into which nature is described as thrown, by the perpetration of this horrid murder. (see 1765, VI, 413, 7)</p>
<p class="p24">II.iii.117 (452,3) Here, lay Duncan,/His silver skin lac&rsquo;d with his golden blood] Mr. Pope has endeavoured to improve one of these lines by substituting <span class="t8">goary blood</span> for <span class="t8">golden blood</span>; but it may easily be admitted that he who could on such an occasion talk of <span class="t8">lacing the silyer skin</span>, would <span class="t8">lace it</span> with <span class="t8">golden blood</span>. No amendment can be made to this line, of which every word is equally faulty, but by a general blot.</p>
<p class="p24">It is not improbable, that Shakespeare put these forced and unnatural metaphors into the mouth of Macbeth as a mark of artifice and dissimulation, to shew the difference between the studied language of hypocrisy, and the natural outcries of sudden passion. This whole speech so considered, is a remarkable instance of judgment, as it consists entirely of antithesis and metaphor.</p>
<p class="p24">II.iii.122 (432,5) Unmannerly breech&rsquo;d with gore] An <span class="t8">unmannerly dagger</span>, and a <span class="t8">dagger breech&rsquo;d</span>, or as in some editions <span class="t8">breech&rsquo;d with</span>, gore, are expressions not easily to be understood. There are undoubtedly two faults in this passage, which I have endeavored to take away by reading,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&mdash; <span class="t8">daggers</span></p>
<p class="p24">Unmanly drench&rsquo;d <span class="t8">with gore</span>: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">I saw</span> drench&rsquo;d <span class="t8">with the King&rsquo;s blood the fatal daggers, not only instruments of murder but evidence of cowardice</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">Each of these words might easily be confounded with that which I have substituted for it, by a hand not exact, a casual blot, or a negligent inspection, [W: Unmanly reech&rsquo;d] Dr. Warburton has, perhaps, rightly put <span class="t8">reach&rsquo;d</span> for <span class="t8">breech&rsquo;d</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">II.iii.138 (454,8)</p>
<p class="p24">In the great hand of God I stand; and thence,</p>
<p class="p24">Against the undivulg&rsquo;d pretence I fight</p>
<p class="p24">Of treasonous malice]</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Pretence</span> is not act, but <span class="t8">simulation</span>, a <span class="t8">pretence</span> of the traitor, whoever he might be, to suspect some other of the murder. I here fly to the protector of innocence from any charge which, yet <span class="t8">undivulg&rsquo;d</span>, the traitor may pretend to fix upon me.</p>
<p class="p24">II.iii.147 (454,7) This murtherous shaft that&rsquo;s shot,/Hath not yet lighted] The design to fix the murder opon some innocent person, has not yet taken effect.</p>
<p class="p24">II.iv.15 (456,9) minions of their race] Theobald reads,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&mdash; <span class="t8">minions of</span> the <span class="t8">race</span>,</p>
<p class="p24">very probably, and very poetically.</p>
<p class="p24">II.iv.24 (456,1) What good could they pretend?] To <span class="t8">pretend</span> is here to <span class="t8">propose to themselves</span>, to <span class="t8">set before themselves</span> as a motive of action.</p>
<p class="p24">III.i.7 (457,2) As upon thee, Macbeth, their speeches shine] <span class="t8">Shine</span>, for appear with all the <span class="t8">lustre</span> of <span class="t8">conspicuous</span> truth.</p>
<p class="p24">III.i.56 (459,4) as, it is said,/Mark Anthony&rsquo;s was by Caesar] Though I would not often assume the critic&rsquo;s privilege of being confident where certainty cannot be obtained, nor indulge myself too far in departing from the established reading; yet I cannot but propose the rejection of this passage, which I believe was an insertion of some player, that having so much learning as to discover to what Shakespeare alluded, was not willing that his audience should be less knowing than himself, and has therefore weakened the authour&rsquo;s sense by the intrusion of a remote and useless image into a speech bursting from a man wholly possess&rsquo;d with his own present condition, and therefore not at leisure to explain his own allusions to himself. If these words are taken away, by which not only the thought but the numbers are injured, the lines of Shakespeare close together without any traces of a breach.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">My genius is rebuk&rsquo;d. He chid the sisters.</span></p>
<p class="p24">This note was written before I was fully acquainted with Shakespeare&rsquo;s manner, and I do not now think it of much weight; for though the words, which I was once willing to eject, seem interpolated, I believe they may still be genuine, and added by the authour in his revision. The authour of the <span class="t8">Revisal</span> cannot admit the measure to be faulty. There is only one foot, he says, put for another. This is one of the effects of literature in minds not naturally perspicacious. Every boy or girl finds the metre imperfect, but the pedant comes to its defence with a tribrachys or an anapaest, and sets it right at once by applying to one language the rules of another. If we may be allowed to change feet, like the old comic writers, it will not be easy to write a line not metrical. To hint this once, is sufficient. (see 1765, VI, 424, 2)</p>
<p class="p24">III.i.65 (460,5) For Banquo&rsquo;s issue have I fil&rsquo;d my mind] [W: &lsquo;filed] This mark of contraction is not necessary. To <span class="t8">file</span> is in the bishop&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Bible</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">III.i.69 (460,6) the common enemy of man] It is always an entertainment to an inquisitive reader, to trace a sentiment to its original source; and therefore, though the term <span class="t8">enemy of man</span>, applied to the devil, is in itself natural and obvious, yet some may be pleased with being informed, that Shakespeare probably borrowed it from the first lines of the Destruction of Troy, a book which he is known to have read. This expression, however, he might have had in many other places. The word <span class="t8">fiend</span> signifies enemy.</p>
<p class="p24">III.i.71 (461,7) come, Fate, into the list,/And champion me to the utterance!] This passage will be best explained by translating it into the language from whence the only word of difficulty in it is borrowed, &ldquo;<span class="t8">Que la destinée se rende en lice, et qu&rsquo;elle me donne un defi a l&rsquo;outrance</span>.&rdquo; A challenge or a combat <span class="t8">a l&rsquo;outrance</span>, <span class="t8">to extremity</span>, was a fix&rsquo;d term in the law of arms, used when the combatants engaged with an <span class="t8">odium internecinum, an intention to destroy each other</span>, in opposition to trials of skill at festivals, or on other occasions, where the contest was only for reputation or a prize. The sense therefore is, <span class="t8">Let Fate, that has foredoom&rsquo;d the exaltation of the sons of Banquo, enter the lists against me, with the utmost animosity, in defence of its own decrees, which I will endeavour to invalidate, whatever be the danger</span>. [Johnson quotes Warburton&rsquo;s note] After the former explication, Dr. Warburton was desirous to seem to do something; and he has therefore made <span class="t8">Fate</span> the <span class="t8">marshal</span>, whom I had made the <span class="t8">champion</span>, and has left Macbeth to enter the lists without an opponent.</p>
<p class="p24">III.i.88 (462,9) Are you so gospell&rsquo;d] Are you of that degree of precise virtue? <span class="t8">Gospeller</span> was a name of contempt given by the Papists to the Lollards, the puritans of early times, and the precursors of <span class="t8">protestantism</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">III.i.94 (463,1) Showghes] <span class="t8">Showghes</span> are probably what we now call <span class="t8">shocks</span>, demi-wolves, <span class="t8">lyciscae</span>; dogs bred between wolves and dogs. (1773)</p>
<p class="p24">III.i.95 (463,2) the valued file] In this speech the word <span class="t8">file</span> occurs twice, and seems in both places to have a meaning different from its present use. The expression, <span class="t8">valued file</span>, evidently means, a list or catalogue of value. A station in the <span class="t8">file</span>, and not in the worst rank, may mean, a place in the list of manhood, and not in the lowest place. But <span class="t8">file</span> seems rather to mean in this place, a post of honour; the first rank, in opposition to the last; a meaning which I have not observed in any other place. (1773)</p>
<p class="p24">III.i.112 (465,2) So weary with disasters, tug&rsquo;d with fortune] <span class="t8">Tug&rsquo;d with fortune</span> may be, <span class="t8">tug&rsquo;d</span> or <span class="t8">worried</span> by fortune.</p>
<p class="p24">III.i.130 (465,4) Acquaint you with the perfect spy o&rsquo; the time] What is meant by <span class="t8">the spy of the time</span>, it will be found difficult to explain; and therefore sense will be cheaply gained by a slight alteration. &mdash; Macbeth is assuring the assassins that they shall not want directions to find Banquo, and therefore says,</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">I will</span> &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Acquaint you with</span> a perfect spy <span class="t8">o&rsquo; the time</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">Accordingly a third murderer joins them afterwards at the place of action.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Perfect</span> is <span class="t8">well instructed</span>, or <span class="t8">well informed</span>, as in this play,</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Though in your state of honour I am</span> perfect.</p>
<p class="p24">though I am <span class="t8">well acquainted</span> with your quality and rank. [Warburton explained this as &ldquo;the critical juncture&rdquo;] How the <span class="t8">critical juncture</span> is the <span class="t8">spy o&rsquo; the time</span> I know not, but I think my own conjecture right.</p>
<p class="p24">III.ii.38 (467,1) nature&rsquo;s copy&rsquo;s not eternal] The <span class="t8">copy</span>, the <span class="t8">lease</span>, by which they hold their lives from nature, has its time of termination limited.</p>
<p class="p24">III.iii.1 (469,6) But who did bid thee join with us?] The meaning of this abrupt dialogue is this. The <span class="t8">perfect spy</span>, mentioned by Macbeth in the foregoing scene, has, before they enter upon the stage, given them the directions which were promised at the time of their agreement; yet one of the murderers suborned suspects him of intending to betray them; the other observes, that, by his exact knowledge of <span class="t8">what they were to do</span>, he appears to be employed by Macbeth, and needs not be mistrusted.</p>
<p class="p24">III.iv.1 (470,9) You know your own degrees, sit down: at first,/And last the hearty welcome] As this passage stands [sit down:/At first and last], not only the numbers are very imperfect, but the sense, if any can be found, weak and contemptible. The numbers will be improved by reading,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&mdash; <span class="t8">sit down at first,</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">And last a hearty welcome</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">But for <span class="t8">last</span> should then be written <span class="t8">next</span>. I believe the true reading is,</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">You know your own degrees, sit down</span>. &mdash; <span class="t8">To first</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">And last the hearty welcome</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">All of whatever degree, from the highest to the lowest, may be assured that their visit is well received.</p>
<p class="p24">III.iv.14 (471,1) &rsquo;Tis better thee without, than he within] The sense requires that this passage should be read thus:</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">&rsquo;Tis better</span> thee <span class="t8">without, than</span> him <span class="t8">within</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">That is, <span class="t8">I am better pleased that the blood of Banquo should be on thy face than in his body</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">The authour might mean, <span class="t8">It is better that Banquo&rsquo;s blood were on thy face, than</span> he <span class="t8">in this room</span>. Expressions thus imperfect are common in his works.</p>
<p class="p24">III.iv.33 (472,2) the feast is sold] The meaning is, &mdash; That which ia not <span class="t8">given cheerfully</span>, cannot be called a <span class="t8">gift</span>, it is something that must be paid for. (1773)</p>
<p class="p24">III.iv.57 (473,3) extend his passion] Prolong his suffering; make his fit longer.</p>
<p class="p24">III.iv.60 (473,4) O proper stuff!] This speech is rather too long for the circumstances in which it is spoken. It had begun better at, <span class="t8">Shame itself</span>!</p>
<p class="p24">III.iv.63 (473,5)</p>
<p class="p24">Oh, these flaws, and starts,</p>
<p class="p24">(Impostors to true fear,) would well become</p>
<p class="p24">A woman&rsquo;s story at a winter&rsquo;s fire,</p>
<p class="p24">Authoriz&rsquo;d by her grandam]</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Flaws</span>, are <span class="t8">sudden gusts</span>. The authour perhaps wrote,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&mdash; <span class="t8">Those flaws and starts</span>,</p>
<p class="p24">Impostures true to fear <span class="t8">would well become</span>;</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">A woman&rsquo;s story</span>, &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">These symptoms of terrour and amazement might better become <span class="t8">impostures true</span> only <span class="t8">to fear, might become a coward at the recital of such falsehoods as no man could credit, whose understanding was not weaken&rsquo;d by his terrours; tales told by a woman over a fire on the authority of her grandam</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">III.iv.76 (474,6) Ere human statute purg&rsquo;d the gentle weal] The <span class="t8">gentle weal</span>, is, the <span class="t8">peaceable community</span>, the state made quiet and safe by <span class="t8">human statutes</span>.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Mollia securae peragebant otia gentes</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">III.iv.92 (475,7) And all to all] I once thought it should be <span class="t8">hail</span> to all, but I now think that the present reading is right.</p>
<p class="p24">III.iv.105 (475,8) If trembling I inhabit] This is the original reading, which Mr. Pope changed to <span class="t8">inhibit</span>, which <span class="t8">inhibit</span> Dr. Warburton interprets <span class="t8">refuse</span>. The old reading may stand, at least as well as the emendation. Suppose we read,</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">If trembling I</span> evade <span class="t8">it</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">III.iv.110 (476,9) Can such things be,/And overcome us, like a summer&rsquo;s cloud,/Without our special wonder?] [W: Can&rsquo;t] The alteration is introduced by a misinterpretation. The meaning is not that <span class="t8">these things are like a summer-cloud</span>, but can such wonders as these pass over us without wonder, as a casual summer cloud passes over us.</p>
<p class="p24">III.iv.112 (477,1) You make me strange/Even to the disposition that I owe] You produce in me an <span class="t8">alienation of mind</span>, which is probably the expression which our author intended to paraphrase.</p>
<p class="p24">III.iv.124 (477,2) Augurs, and understood relations] By the word <span class="t8">relation</span> is understood the <span class="t8">connection</span> of effects with causes; to <span class="t8">understand relations</span> as <span class="t8">an angur</span>, is to know how these things <span class="t8">relate</span> to each other, which have no visible combination or dependence.</p>
<p class="p24">III.iv.141 (479,5) You lack the season of all natures, sleep] I take the meaning to be, <span class="t8">you want sleep</span>, which <span class="t8">seasons</span>, or gives the relish to <span class="t8">all nature</span>. <span class="t8">Indiget somni vitae condimenti</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">III.v.24 (480,8) vaporous drop, profound] That is, a drop that has <span class="t8">profound</span>, <span class="t8">deep</span>, or <span class="t8">hidden</span> qualities.</p>
<p class="p24">III.v.26 (480,9) slights] Arts; subtle practices.</p>
<p class="p24">III.vi (481,1) <span class="t8">Enter Lenox, and another Lord</span>] As this tragedy, like the rest of Shakespeare&rsquo;s, is perhaps overstocked with personages, it is not easy to assign a reason why a nameless character should be introduced here, since nothing is said that might not with equal propriety have been put into the mouth of any other disaffected man. I believe therefore that in the original copy it was written with a very common form of contraction Lenox and An. for which the transcriber, instead of Lenox and Angus, set down Lenox and <span class="t8">another Lord</span>. The author had indeed been more indebted to the transcriber&rsquo;s fidelity and diligence had he committed no errors of greater importance.</p>
<p class="p24">III.vi.36 (482,3) and receive free honours] [<span class="t8">Free</span> for grateful. WARBURTON.] How can <span class="t8">free</span> be <span class="t8">grateful</span>? It may be either honours <span class="t8">freely bestowed</span>, not purchased by crimes; or honours <span class="t8">without slavery</span>, without dread of a tyrant.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.i (484,5) As this is the chief scene of enchantment in the play, it is proper in this place to observe, with how much judgment Shakespeare has selected all the circumstances of his infernal ceremonies, and how exactly he has conformed to common opinions and traditions:</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Thrice the brinded cat hath mew&rsquo;d</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">The usual form in which familiar spirits are reported to converse with witches, is that of a cat. A witch, who was tried about half a century before the time of Shakespeare, had a cat named Rutterkin, as the spirit of one of these witches was Grimalkin; and when any mischief was to be done she used to bid Rutterkin <span class="t8">go and fly</span>, but once when she would have sent Rutterkin to torment a daughter of the countess of Rutland, instead of <span class="t8">going</span> or <span class="t8">flying</span>, he only cried <span class="t8">mew</span>, from whence she discovered that the lady was out of his power, the power of witches being not universal, but limited, as Shakespeare has taken care to inculcate:</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Though his bark cannot be lost,</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Yet it shall be tempest-tost.</span></p>
<p class="p24">The common afflictions which the malice of witches produced were melancholy, fits, and loss of flesh, which are threatened by one of Shakespeare&rsquo;s witches:</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Weary sev&rsquo;n nights, nine times nine,</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Shall he dwindle, peak, and pine.</span></p>
<p class="p24">It was likewise their practice to destroy the cattle of their neighbours, and the farmers have to this day many ceremonies to secure their cows and other cattle from witchcraft; but they seem to have been most suspected of malice against swine. Shakespeare has accordingly made one of his witches declare that she has been <span class="t8">killing swine</span>, and Dr. Harsenet observes, that about that time, <span class="t8">a sow could not be ill of the measles, nor a girl of the sullens, but some old woman was charged with witchcraft</span>.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Toad, that under the cold stone,</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Days and night has, thirty-one,</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Swelter&rsquo;d venom sleeping got;</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Boil thou first i&rsquo;the charm&rsquo;d pot</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">Toads have likewise long lain under the reproach of being by some means accessory to witchcraft, for which reason Shakespeare, in the first scene of this play, calls one of the spirits Padocke or Toad, and now takes care to put a toad first into the pot. When Vaninus was seized at Theleuse, there was found at his lodgings <span class="t8">ingens Bufo Vitro inclusus, a great toad shut in a vial</span>, upon which those that prosecuted him, <span class="t8">Veneficium exprebrabent, charged him</span>, I suppose, <span class="t8">with witchcraft</span>.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Fillet of fenny snake,</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">In the cauldron boil and bakae:</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Eye of newt, and toe of frog; &mdash; </span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">For a charm, &amp;c</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">The propriety of these ingredients may be known by consulting the books <span class="t8">de Viribus Animalium</span> and <span class="t8">de Mirabilibus Mundi</span>, ascribed to Albertus Magnus, in which the reader, who has time and credulity, may discover very wonderful secrets.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Finger of birth-strangled babe,</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Ditch deliver&rsquo;d by a drab</span>; &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">It has been already mentioned in the law against witches, that they are supposed to take up dead bodies to use in enchantments, which was confessed by the woman whom king James examined, and who had of a dead body that was divided in one of their assemblies, two fingers for her share. It is observable that Shakespeare, on this great occasion, which involves the fate of a king, multiplies all the circumstanaces of horror. The babe, whose finger is used, must be strangled in its birth; the grease must not only be human, but must have dropped from a gibbet, the gibbet of a murderer; and even the sow, whose blood is used, must have offended nature by devouring her own farrow. These are touches of judgment and genius.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">And now about the cauldron sing &mdash; </span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Black spirits and white,</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Blue spirits and grey,</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Mingle, mingle, mingle,</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">You that mingle say</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">And in a former part,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&mdash; <span class="t8">weyward sisters, hand in hand, &mdash; </span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Thus do go about, about.</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Thrice to thine, and thrice to mine.</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">And thrice again to make up nine!</span></p>
<p class="p24">These two passages I have brought together, because they both seem subject to the objection of too much levity for the solemnity of enchantment, and may both be shewn, by one quotation from Camden&rsquo;s account of Ireland, to be founded upon a practice really observed by the uncivilised natives of that country: &ldquo;When any one gets a fall, <span class="t8">says the informer of Camden</span>, he starts up, and, <span class="t8">turning three times to the right</span>, digs a hole in the earth; for they imagine that there is a spirit in the ground, and if he falls sick in two or three days, they send one of their women that is skilled in that way to the place, where she says, I call thee from the east, west, north, and south, from the groves, the woods, the rivers, and the fens, from the fairies <span class="t8">red, black, white</span>.&rdquo; There was likewise a book written before the time of Shakespeare, describing, amongst other properties, the <span class="t8">colours</span> of spirits.</p>
<p class="p24">Many other circumstances might be particularised, in which Shakespeare has shown his judgment and his knowledge.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.i.53 (489,6) yesty waves] That is, <span class="t8">foaming</span> or <span class="t8">frothy waves</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.i.88 (491,1) the round/And top of sovereignty?] This <span class="t8">round</span> is that part of the crown that encircles the head. The <span class="t8">top</span> is the ornament that rises above it.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.i.95 (492,3) Who can impress the forest] i.e. who can command the forest to serve him like a soldier impress&rsquo;d. (1773)</p>
<p class="p24">IV.i.97 (492,4) Rebellious head, rise never] Mr. Theobald, who first proposed this change [&ldquo;head&rdquo; for &ldquo;dead&rdquo;] rightly observes, that <span class="t8">head</span> means <span class="t8">host</span>, or power.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&mdash; <span class="t8">Douglas and the rebels met,</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">A mighty and a fearful</span> head <span class="t8">they are</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">And again,</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">His divisions &mdash; are in three heads</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.i.113 (493,6) Thy crown does sear mine eye-balls] The expression of Macbeth, that the <span class="t8">crown</span> sears <span class="t8">his</span> eye-balls, is taken from the method formerly practised of destroying the sight of captives or competitors, by holding a burning bason before the eye, which dried up its humidity. Whence the Italian, <span class="t8">abacinare</span>, to <span class="t8">blind</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.i.113 (493,7) And thy air,/Thou other gold-bound brow, is like the first: &mdash; /A third is like the former] In former editions,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&mdash; <span class="t8">and thy</span> hair,</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Thou other gold-bound brow, is like the first</span>: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">A third is like the former</span>: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">As Macbeth expected to see a train of kings, and was only enquiring from what race they would proceed, he could not be surprised that the <span class="t8">hair</span> of the second was <span class="t8">bound with gold</span> like that of the first; he was offended only that the second resembled the first, as the first resembled Banquo, and therefore said,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&mdash; <span class="t8">and thy</span> air,</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Thou other gold-bound brow, is like the first</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">This Dr. Warburton has followed.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.i.144 (495,2) Time, thou anticipat&rsquo;st my dread exploits] To <span class="t8">anticipate</span> is here to <span class="t8">prevent</span>, by taking away the opportunity.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.ii.9 (496,3) He wants the natural touch] Natural sensibility. He is not touched with natural affection.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.ii.71 (498,7) To do worse to you, were fell cruelty] To do <span class="t8">worse</span> is, to let her and her children be destroyed without warning.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.iii.2 (500,9) Let us rather/Hold fast the mortal sword; and, like good men,/ Bestride our down-faln birthdom] In former editions,</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Let us rather</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Hold fast the mortal sword; and, like good men,</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Bestride our</span> downfal birthdoom. &mdash; ]</p>
<p class="p24">He who can discover what is meant by him that earnestly exhorts him to <span class="t8">bestride</span> his <span class="t8">downfal birth-doom</span>, is at liberty to adhere to the present text; but it is probable that Shakespeare wrote,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&mdash; <span class="t8">like good men,</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Bestride our</span> downfaln birthdom &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">The allusion is to a man from whom something valuable is about to be taken by violence, and who, that he may defend it without incombrance, lays it on the ground, and stands over it with his weapon in his hand. Our birthdom, or birthright, says he, lies on the ground, let us, like men who are to fight for what is dearest to them, not abandon it, but stand over it and defend it. This is a strong picture of obstinate resolution. So Falstaff says to Hal.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">When I am down, if thou wilt</span> bestride me, <span class="t8">so</span>.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Birthdom</span> for <span class="t8">birthright</span> is formed by the same analogy with <span class="t8">masterdom</span> in this play, signifying the <span class="t8">privileges</span> or <span class="t8">rights</span> of a <span class="t8">master</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">Perhaps it might be <span class="t8">birth-dame</span> for <span class="t8">mother</span>; let us stand over our <span class="t8">mother</span> that lies bleeding on the ground.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.iii.19 (501,4) A good and virtuous nature may recoil/In an imperial charge] A good mind may <span class="t8">recede</span> from goodness in the execution of a <span class="t8">royal commission</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.iii.23 (501,5) Though all things foul would wear the brows of grace,/Yet grace must look still so] This is not very clear. The meaning perhaps is this: &mdash; <span class="t8">My suspicions cannot injure you, if you be virtuous, by supposing that a traitor may put on your virtuous appearance. I do not say that your virtuous appearance proves you a traitor; for virtue must wear its proper form, though that form be often counterfeited by villany</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.iii.26 (502,6) Why in that rawness left you wife and children] Without previous provision, without due preparation, without <span class="t8">maturity</span> of counsel.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.iii.33 (502,7) Wear thou thy wrongs] That is, <span class="t8">Poor country, wear thou thy wrongs</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.iii.69 (503,1) Sudden, malicious] [<span class="t8">Sudden</span>, for capricious. WARBUR.] Rather violent, passionate, hasty.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.iii.85 (504,2) Than summer seeming lust] When I was younger and bolder I corrected it thus,</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Than fume, or seething lust</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">that is, Than angry passion, or boiling lust. (1773)</p>
<p class="p24">IV.iii.135 (506,4) All ready at a point] [W: at appoint] There is no need of change.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.iii.136 (506,5) and the chance of goodness/Be like our warranted quarrel!] The <span class="t8">chance of goodness</span>, as it is commonly read, conveys no sense. If there be not some more important errour in the passage, it should at least be pointed thus:</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&mdash; <span class="t8">and the chance, of goodness,</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Be like our warranted quarrel</span>! &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">That is, may the event be, of the goodness of heaven, [<span class="t8">pro justitia divina</span>] answerable to the cause.</p>
<p class="p24">The author of the <span class="t8">Revisal</span> conceives the sense of the passage to be rather this: <span class="t8">And may the success of that goodness, which is about to exert itself in my behalf, be such as may be equal to the justice of my quarrel</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">But I am inclined to believe that Shakespeare wrote,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&mdash; and the chance, O goodness,</p>
<p class="p24">Be like our warranted quarrel! &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">This some of his transcribers wrote with a small <span class="t8">o</span>, which another imagined to mean <span class="t8">of</span>. If we adopt this reading, the sense will be, <span class="t8">and O thou sovereign Goodness, to whom we now appeal, may our fortune answer to our cause</span>. (see 1765, VI, 462, 7)</p>
<p class="p24">IV.iii.170 (508,9) A modern ecstacy] I believe <span class="t8">modern</span> is only <span class="t8">foolish</span> or <span class="t8">trifling</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.iii.196 (509,2), fee-grief] A peculiar sorrow; a grief that hath a single owner. The expression is, at least to our ears, very harsh.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.iii.216 (511,4) He has no children] It has been observed by an anonymous critic, that this is not said of Macbeth, who had children, but of Malcolm, who having none, supposes a father.</p>
<p class="p24">V.i.86 (515,8) My mind she has mated] [Conquer&rsquo;d or subdued. POPE.] Rather astonished, confounded.</p>
<p class="p24">V.ii.24 (516,1) When all that is within him does condemn/Itself, for being there?] That is, when all the faculties of the mind are employed in self-condemnation.</p>
<p class="p24">V.iii.1 (516,2) Bring me no more reports] <span class="t8">Tell me not any more of desertions &mdash; Let all ny subjects leave me &mdash; I am safe till,</span> &amp;c.</p>
<p class="p24">V.iii.8 (517,3) English Epicures] The reproach of Epicurism, on which Mr. Theobald has bestowed a note, is nothing more than a natural invective uttered by an inhabitant of a barren country, against, those who have more opportunities of luxury.</p>
<p class="p24">V.iii.22 (518,6) my way of life/Is fall&rsquo;n into the sear] As there is no relation between the <span class="t8">way of life</span>, and <span class="t8">fallen into the sear</span>, I am inclined to think that the W is only an M inverted, and that it was originally written,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&mdash; <span class="t8">my</span> May <span class="t8">of life</span>.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">I am now passed from the spring to the autumn of my days, but I am without those comforts that should succeed the spriteliness of bloom, and support me in this melancholy season.</span></p>
<p class="p24">The authour has <span class="t8">May</span> in the same sense elsewhere.</p>
<p class="p24">V.iv.8 (521,1) the confident tyrant/Keeps still in Dunsinane, and will endure/Our setting down before&rsquo;t] He was <span class="t8">confident</span> of success; so <span class="t8">confident</span> that he would not fly, but endure their <span class="t8">setting down</span> before his castle.</p>
<p class="p24">V.iv.11 (521,2) For where there is advantage to be given,/ Both more and less have given him the revolt] The impropriety of the expression, <span class="t8">advantage to be given</span>, and the disagreeable repetition of the word <span class="t8">given</span> in the next line, incline me to read,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&mdash; <span class="t8">where there is</span> a &lsquo;vantage <span class="t8">to be</span> gone,</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Both more and less have given him the revolt.</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Advantage or &lsquo;vantage</span>, in the time of Shakespeare, signified <span class="t8">opportunity</span>. <span class="t8">He shut up himself and his soldiers</span>, (says Malcolm) <span class="t8">in the castle, because when there is an opportunity to be gone they all desert him</span>.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">More and less</span> is the same with <span class="t8">greater and less</span>. So in the interpolated <span class="t8">Mandeville</span>, a book of that age, there is a chapter of <span class="t8">India the More and the Less</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">V.iv.20 (522,4) arbitrate] &mdash; <span class="t8">arbitrate</span> is <span class="t8">determine</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">V.v.11 (523,3) fell of hair] My hairy part, my <span class="t8">capillitium</span>. <span class="t8">Fell</span> is <span class="t8">skin</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">V.v.17 (523,7) She should have dy&rsquo;d hereafter;/ There would have been a time for such a word] This passage has very justly been suspected of being corrupt. It is not apparent for what <span class="t8">word</span> there would have been a <span class="t8">time</span>, and that there would or would not be a <span class="t8">time</span> for any <span class="t8">word</span> seems not a consideration of importance sufficient to transport Macbeth into the following exclamation. I read therefore,</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">She should have dy&rsquo;d hereafter.</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">There would have been a time for &mdash; such a</span> world! &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Tomorrow</span>, &amp;c.</p>
<p class="p24">It is a broken speech in which only part of the thought is expressed, and may be paraphrased thus: <span class="t8">The queen is dead</span>. Macbeth. <span class="t8">Her death should have been deferred to some more peaceful hour; had she liv&rsquo;d longer</span>, there would at length have been a time for the <span class="t8">honours due to her as a queen, and that respect which I owe her for her fidelity and love. Such is the</span> world &mdash; such is the condition of human life, that we always think to-morrow <span class="t8">will be happier than to-day, but to-morrow and to-morrow steals over us unenjoyed and unregarded, and we still linger in the same expectation to the moment appointed for our end. All these days, which have thus passed away, have sent multitudes of fools to the grave, who were engrossed by the same dream of future felicity, and, when life was departing from them, were, like me, reckoning on to-morrow</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">Such was once my conjecture, but I am now less confident. Macbeth might mean, that there would have been a more convenient <span class="t8">time</span> for such a <span class="t8">word</span>, for such <span class="t8">intelligence</span>, and so fall into the following reflection. We say we send <span class="t8">word</span> when we give intelligence.</p>
<p class="p24">V.v.21 (524,8) To the last syllable of recorded time] <span class="t8">Recorded time</span> seems to signify the time fixed in the decrees of Heaven for the period of life. The <span class="t8">record</span> of <span class="t8">futurity</span> is indeed no accurate expression, but as we only know transactions past or present, the language of men affords no term for the volumes of prescience, in which future events may be supposed to be written.</p>
<p class="p24">V.v.23 (524,9) The way to dusty death] <span class="t8">Dusty</span> is a very natural epithet. The second folio has,</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">The way to</span> study <span class="t8">death</span>. &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">which Mr. Upton prefers, but it is only an errour by an accidental transposition of the types.</p>
<p class="p24">V.v.42 (525,2) I pull in resolution, and begin/To doubt the equivocation of the fiend,/ That lies like truth] Though this is the reading of all the editions, yet, as it is a phrase without either example, elegance or propriety, it is surely better to read,</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">I</span> pall <span class="t8">in resolution, &mdash; </span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">I languish in my constancy, my confidence begins to forsake as</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">It is scarcely necessary to observe how easily <span class="t8">pall</span> might be changed into <span class="t8">pull</span> by a negligent writer, or mistaken for it by an unskilful printer. With this emendation Dr. Warburton and Mr. Heath concur. (see 1765, VI,478,8)</p>
<p class="p24">V.viii.9 (529,3) the intrenchant air] That is, air which cannot be cut.</p>
<p class="p24">V.viii.20 (529,5) That palter with us in a double sense] That <span class="t8">shuffle</span> with ambiguous expressions.</p>
<p class="p24">V.viii.48 (531,7) Had I as many sons as I have hairs, I would not wish them to a fairer death]</p>
<p class="p24">This incident is thus related from Henry of Huntingdon by Camden in his <span class="t8">Remains</span>, from which our authour probably copied it.</p>
<p class="p24">When Seyward, the martial earl of Northumberland, understood that his son, whom he had sent in service against the Scotchmen, was slain, he demanded whether his wounds were in the fore part or hinder part of his body. When it was answered, in the fore part, he replied, &ldquo;I am right glad; neither wish I any other death to me or mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">General Observation. This play is deservedly celebrated for the propriety of its fictions, and solemnity, grandeur, and variety of its action; but it has no nice discriminations of character, the events are too great to admit the influence of particular dispositions, and the course of the action necessarily determines the conduct of the agents.</p>
<p class="p24">The danger of ambition is well described; and I know not whether it may not be said in defence of some parts which now seem improbable, that, in Shakespeare&rsquo;s time, it was necessary to warn credulity against vain and illusive predictions.</p>
<p class="p24">The passions are directed to their true end. Lady Macbeth is merely detested; and though the courage of Macbeth preserves some esteem, yet every reader rejoices at his fall.</p>
