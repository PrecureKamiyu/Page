Now you might find this surprising, recalling from <a class="xref" href="fileP70010119520000000000000000019C1.xhtml#P70010119520000000000000000019C1" data-foobar="7"><span class="label">Chapter</span> <span class="number">4</span></a> that hosts and routers have network-layer addresses as well. You might be asking, why in the world do we need to have addresses at both the network and link layers? In addition to describing the syntax and function of the link-layer addresses, in this section we hope to shed some light on why the two layers of addresses are useful and, in fact, indispensable. We’ll also cover the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP), which provides a mechanism to translate IP addresses to link-layer addresses.</p>

A host or router with multiple network interfaces will thus have multiple link-layer addresses associated with it, just as it would also have multiple IP addresses associated with it. It's important to note, however, that link-layer switches do not have link-layer addresses associated with their interfaces that connect to hosts and routers. This is because the job of the link-layer switch is to carry datagrams between hosts and routers; a switch does this job transparently, that is, without the host or router having to explicitly address the frame to the intervening switch. This is illustrated in <a class="xref" href="#P7001011952000000000000000002568" data-foobar="1"><span class="label">Figure</span> <span class="number">6.16</span></a>.

Because MAC address seems to be the most popular term, we’ll henceforth refer to link-layer addresses as MAC addresses. For most LANs (including Ethernet and 802.11 wireless LANs), the MAC address is 6 bytes long, giving 2<sup>48</sup> possible MAC addresses. As shown in <a class="xref" href="#P7001011952000000000000000002568" data-foobar="1"><span class="label">Figure</span> <span class="number">6.16</span></a>, these 6-byte addresses are typically expressed in hexadecimal notation, with each byte of the address expressed as a pair of hexadecimal numbers. Although MAC addresses were designed to be permanent, it is now possible to change an adapter’s MAC address via software. For the rest of this section, however, we’ll assume that an adapter’s MAC address is fixed.</p>

The answer is that the IEEE manages the MAC address space. In particular, when a company wants to manufacture adapters, it purchases a chunk of the address space consisting of 2<sup>24</sup> addresses for a nominal fee. IEEE allocates the chunk of 2<sup>24</sup> addresses by fixing the first 24 bits of a MAC address and letting the company create unique combinations of the last 24 bits for each adapter.</p>

A laptop with an Ethernet interface always has the same MAC address, no matter where the computer goes. A smartphone with an 802.11 interface always has the same MAC address, no matter where the smartphone goes. Recall that, in contrast, IP addresses have a hierarchical structure (that is, a network part and a host part), and a host’s IP addresses needs to be changed when the host moves, i.e., changes the network to which it is attached. An adapter’s MAC address is analogous to a person’s social security number, which also has a flat addressing structure and which doesn’t change no matter where the person goes. An IP address is analogous to a person’s postal address, which is hierarchical and which must be changed whenever a person moves. Just as a person may find it useful to have both a postal address and a social security number, it is useful for a host and router interfaces to have both a network-layer address and a MAC address.</p>

As we will soon see, a switch occasionally broadcasts an incoming frame onto all of its interfaces. We’ll see in <a class="xref" href="fileP70010119520000000000000000028C7.xhtml#P70010119520000000000000000028C7" data-foobar="7"><span class="label">Chapter</span> <span class="number">7</span></a> that 802.11 also broadcasts frames. Thus, an adapter may receive a frame that isn’t addressed to it. Thus, when an adapter receives a frame, it will check to see whether the destination MAC address <span class="pagebreak" title="470" id="P7001011952000000000000000002571" data-uri="M06_KURO4140_07_SE_C06.xhtml#P7001011952000000000000000002571" epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>in the frame matches its own MAC address. If there is a match, the adapter extracts the enclosed datagram and passes the datagram up the protocol stack. If there isn’t a match, the adapter discards the frame, without passing the network-layer datagram up. Thus, the destination only will be interrupted when the frame is received.</p>

First, LANs are designed for arbitrary network-layer protocols, not just for IP and the Internet. If adapters were assigned IP addresses rather than “neutral” MAC addresses, then adapters would not easily be able to support other network-layer protocols (for example, IPX or DECnet). Second, if adapters were to use network-layer addresses instead of MAC addresses, the network-layer address would have to be stored in the adapter RAM and reconfigured every time the adapter was moved (or powered up). Another option is to not use any addresses in the adapters and have each adapter pass the data (typically, an IP datagram) of each frame it receives up the protocol stack. The network layer could then check for a matching network-layer address. One problem with this option is that the host would be interrupted by every frame sent on the LAN, including by frames that were destined for other hosts on the same broadcast LAN. In summary, in order for the layers to be largely independent building blocks in a network architecture, different layers need to have their own addressing scheme. We have now seen three types of addresses: host names for the application layer, IP addresses for the network layer, and MAC addresses for the link layer.</p>

For the purposes of this discussion, we will assume in this section that the switch broadcasts all frames; that is, whenever a switch receives a frame on one interface, it forwards the frame on all of its other interfaces. In the next section, we will provide a more accurate explanation of how switches operate.</p>

In this example, both the source and destination are in the same subnet, in the addressing sense of <a class="xref" href="fileP7001011952000000000000000001A2A.xhtml#P7001011952000000000000000001A94" data-foobar="7"><span class="label">Section</span> <span class="number">4.3.3</span></a>. To send a datagram, the source must give its adapter not only the IP datagram but also the MAC address for destination 222.222.222.222. The sending adapter will then construct a link-layer frame containing the destination’s MAC address and send the frame into the LAN.</p>
<p id="P700101195200000000000000000B05C" data-uri="M06_KURO4140_07_SE_C06.xhtml#P700101195200000000000000000B05C">The important question addressed in this section is, How does the sending host determine the MAC address for the destination host with IP address 222.222.222.222? As you might have guessed, it uses ARP. An ARP module in the sending host takes any IP address on the same LAN as input, and returns the corresponding MAC address. In the example at hand, sending host 222.222.222.220 provides its ARP module the IP address 222.222.222.222, and the ARP module returns the corresponding MAC address 49-BD-D2-C7-56-2A.</p>

In many ways it is analogous to DNS (studied in <a class="xref" href="fileP7001011952000000000000000000D71.xhtml#P7001011952000000000000000000D71" data-foobar="7"><span class="label">Section</span> <span class="number">2.5</span></a>), which resolves host names to IP addresses. However, one important difference between the two resolvers is that DNS resolves host names for hosts anywhere in the Internet, whereas ARP resolves IP addresses only for hosts and router interfaces on the same subnet. If a node in California were to try to use ARP to resolve the IP address for a node in Mississippi, ARP would return with an error.<span class="pagebreak" title="472" id="P700101195200000000000000000258A" data-uri="M06_KURO4140_07_SE_C06.xhtml#P700101195200000000000000000258A" epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"></span></p>

Each host and router has an <span class="keyword" id="P7001011952000000000000000002590" data-uri="M06_KURO4140_07_SE_C06.xhtml#P7001011952000000000000000002590"><b>ARP table</b></span> in its memory, which contains mappings of IP addresses to MAC addresses. <a class="xref" href="#P700101195200000000000000000258B" data-foobar="1"><span class="label">Figure</span> <span class="number">6.18</span></a> shows what an ARP table in host 222.222.222.220 might look like. The ARP table also contains a time-to-live (TTL) value, which indicates when each mapping will be deleted from the table. Note that a table does not necessarily contain an entry for every host and router on the subnet; some may have never been entered into the table, and others may have expired. A typical expiration time for an entry is 20 minutes from when an entry is placed in an ARP table.</p>
<p id="P700101195200000000000000000B062" data-uri="M06_KURO4140_07_SE_C06.xhtml#P700101195200000000000000000B062">Now suppose that host 222.222.222.220 wants to send a datagram that is IP-addressed to another host or router on that subnet. The sending host needs to obtain the MAC address of the destination given the IP address. This task is easy if the sender’s ARP table has an entry for the destination node. But what if the ARP table doesn’t currently have an entry for the destination? In particular, suppose 222.222.222.220 wants to send a datagram to 222.222.222.222. In this case, the sender uses the ARP protocol to resolve the address. First, the sender constructs a special packet called an <span class="keyword" id="P7001011952000000000000000002592" data-uri="M06_KURO4140_07_SE_C06.xhtml#P7001011952000000000000000002592"><b>ARP packet</b></span>. An ARP packet has several fields, including the sending and receiving IP and MAC addresses. Both ARP query and response packets have the same format. The purpose of the ARP query packet is to query all the other hosts and routers on the subnet to determine the MAC address corresponding to the IP address that is being resolved.</p>
<p id="P700101195200000000000000000B063" data-uri="M06_KURO4140_07_SE_C06.xhtml#P700101195200000000000000000B063">Returning to our example, 222.222.222.220 passes an ARP query packet to the adapter along with an indication that the adapter should send the packet to the MAC broadcast address, namely, FF-FF-FF-FF-FF-FF. The adapter encapsulates the ARP packet in a link-layer frame, uses the broadcast address for the frame’s destination address, and transmits the frame into the subnet. Recalling our social security ­number/postal address analogy, an ARP query is equivalent to a person shouting out in a crowded room of cubicles in some company (say, AnyCorp): “What is the social security number of the person whose postal address is Cubicle 13, Room 112, AnyCorp, Palo Alto, California?” The frame containing the ARP query is received by all the other adapters on the subnet, and (because of the broadcast address) each adapter passes the ARP packet within the frame up to its ARP module. Each of these ARP modules checks to see if its IP address matches the destination IP address in the ARP packet. The one with a match sends back to the querying host a response ARP packet with the desired mapping. The querying host 222.222.222.220 can then update its ARP table and send its IP datagram, encapsulated in a link-layer frame whose destination MAC is that of the host or router responding to the earlier ARP query.</p>

First, the query ARP message is sent within a broadcast frame, whereas the response ARP message is sent within a standard frame. Before reading on you should think about why this is so. Second, ARP is plug-and-play; that is, an ARP table gets built ­automatically—it doesn’t have to be configured by a system administrator. And if a host becomes disconnected from the subnet, its entry is eventually deleted from the other ARP tables in the subnet.</p>
<p id="P700101195200000000000000000B065" data-uri="M06_KURO4140_07_SE_C06.xhtml#P700101195200000000000000000B065">Students often wonder if ARP is a link-layer protocol or a network-layer protocol. As we’ve seen, an ARP packet is encapsulated within a link-layer frame and thus lies architecturally above the link layer. However, an ARP packet has fields containing link-layer addresses and thus is arguably a link-layer protocol, but it also contains network-layer addresses and thus is also arguably a network-layer protocol. In the end, ARP is probably best considered a protocol that straddles the boundary between the link and network layers—not fitting neatly into the simple layered protocol stack we studied in <a class="xref" href="fileP7001011952000000000000000000458.xhtml#P7001011952000000000000000000458" data-foobar="7"><span class="label">Chapter</span> <span class="number">1</span></a>.

Specifically, suppose that host 111.111.111.111 wants to send an IP datagram to a host 222.222.222.222. The sending host passes the datagram to its adapter, as usual. But the sending host must also indicate to its adapter an appropriate destination MAC address. What MAC address should the adapter use? One might be tempted to guess that the appropriate MAC address is that of the adapter for host 222.222.222.222, namely, 49-BD-D2-C7-56-2A. This guess, however, would be wrong! If the sending adapter were to use that MAC address, then none of the ­adapters on Subnet 1 would bother to pass the IP datagram up to its network layer, since the frame’s destination address would not match the MAC address of any adapter on Subnet 1. The datagram would just die and go to datagram heaven.</p>
<p id="P700101195200000000000000000B071" data-uri="M06_KURO4140_07_SE_C06.xhtml#P700101195200000000000000000B071">If we look carefully at <a class="xref" href="#P700101195200000000000000000259B" data-foobar="1"><span class="label">Figure</span> <span class="number">6.19</span></a>, we see that in order for a datagram to go from 111.111.111.111 to a host on Subnet 2, the datagram must first be sent to the router interface 111.111.111.110, which is the IP address of the first-hop router on the path to the final destination. Thus, the appropriate MAC address for the frame is the address of the adapter for router interface 111.111.111.110, namely, E6-E9-00-17-BB-4B. How does the sending host acquire the MAC address for 111.111.111.110? By using ARP, of course! Once the sending adapter has this MAC address, it creates a frame (containing the datagram addressed to 222.222.222.222) and sends the frame into Subnet 1. The router adapter on Subnet 1 sees that the link-layer frame is addressed to it, and therefore passes the frame to the network layer of the router. Hooray—the IP datagram has successfully been moved from source host to the router! But we are not finished. We still have to move the datagram from the router to the destination. The router now has to determine the correct interface on which the datagram is to be forwarded. As discussed in <a class="xref" href="fileP70010119520000000000000000019C1.xhtml#P70010119520000000000000000019C1" data-foobar="7"><span class="label">Chapter</span> <span class="number">4</span></a>, this is done by consulting a forwarding table in the router. The forwarding table tells the router that the datagram is to be forwarded via router interface 222.222.222.220. This interface then passes the datagram to its adapter, which encapsulates the datagram in a new frame and sends the frame into Subnet 2. This time, the destination MAC address of the frame is indeed the MAC address of the ultimate destination. And how does the router obtain this destination MAC address? From ARP, of course!</p>

Some of these other technologies succeeded in capturing a part of the LAN market for a few years. But since its invention in the mid-1970s, Ethernet has continued to evolve and grow and has held on to its dominant position. Today, Ethernet is by far the most prevalent wired LAN technology, and it is likely to remain so for the foreseeable future. One might say that Ethernet has been to local area networking what the Internet has been to global networking.</p>

First, Ethernet was the first widely deployed high-speed LAN. Because it was deployed early, network administrators became intimately familiar with Ethernet—its wonders and its quirks—and were reluctant to switch over to other LAN technologies when they came on the scene. Second, token ring, FDDI, and ATM were more complex and expensive than Ethernet, which further discouraged network administrators from switching over. Third, the most compelling reason to switch to another LAN technology (such as FDDI or ATM) was usually the higher data rate of the new technology; however, Ethernet always fought back, producing versions that operated at equal data rates or higher. Switched Ethernet was also introduced in the early 1990s, which further increased its effective data rates. Finally, because Ethernet has been so popular, Ethernet hardware (in particular, adapters and switches) has become a commodity and is remarkably cheap.</p>

The original Ethernet LAN used a coaxial bus to interconnect the nodes. Bus topologies for Ethernet actually persisted throughout the 1980s and into the mid-1990s. Ethernet with a bus topology is a broadcast LAN—all transmitted frames travel to and are processed by <i>all</i> adapters connected to the bus. Recall that we covered Ethernet’s CSMA/CD multiple access protocol with binary exponential backoff in <a class="xref" href="fileP700101195200000000000000000245F.xhtml#P70010119520000000000000000024A3" data-foobar="7"><span class="label">Section</span> <span class="number">6.3.2</span></a>.</p>

In such an installation the hosts (and routers) are directly connected to a hub with twisted-pair copper wire. A <span class="keyword" id="P70010119520000000000000000025AF" data-uri="M06_KURO4140_07_SE_C06.xhtml#P70010119520000000000000000025AF"><b>hub</b></span> is a physical-layer device that acts on individual bits rather than frames. When a bit, representing a zero or a one, arrives from one interface, the hub simply re-creates the bit, boosts its energy strength, and transmits the bit onto all the other interfaces. Thus, Ethernet with a hub-based star topology is also a broadcast LAN—whenever a hub receives a bit from one of its interfaces, it sends a copy out on all of its other interfaces. In particular, if a hub receives frames from two different interfaces at the same time, a collision occurs and the nodes that created the frames must retransmit.</p>

We’ll be examining switched Ethernet in depth later in this chapter.

To give this discussion about Ethernet frames a tangible context, let’s consider sending an IP datagram from one host to another host, with both hosts on the same Ethernet LAN (for example, the Ethernet LAN in <a class="xref" href="#P700101195200000000000000000257E" data-foobar="1"><span class="label">Figure</span> <span class="number">6.17</span></a>.) (Although the payload of our Ethernet frame is an IP datagram, we note that an Ethernet frame can carry other network-layer packets as well.) Let the sending adapter, adapter A, have the MAC address AA-AA-AA-AA-AA-AA and the receiving adapter, adapter B, have the MAC address BB-BB-BB-BB-BB-BB. The sending adapter encapsulates the IP datagram within an Ethernet frame and passes the frame to the physical layer. The receiving adapter receives the frame from the physical layer, extracts the IP datagram, and passes the IP datagram to the network layer. In this context, let’s now examine the six fields of the Ethernet frame, as shown in <a class="xref" href="#P70010119520000000000000000025B3" data-foobar="1"><span class="label">Figure</span> <span class="number">6.20</span></a>.</p>

The maximum transmission unit (MTU) of Ethernet is 1,500 bytes. This means that if the IP datagram exceeds 1,500 bytes, then the host has to fragment the datagram, as discussed in <a class="xref" href="fileP7001011952000000000000000001CE3.xhtml#P7001011952000000000000000001D10" data-foobar="7"><span class="label">Section</span> <span class="number">4.3.2</span></a>. The minimum size of the data field is 46 bytes. This means that if the IP datagram is less than 46 bytes, the data field has to be “stuffed” to fill it out to 46 bytes. When stuffing is used, the data passed to the network layer contains the stuffing as well as an IP datagram. The network layer uses the length field in the IP datagram header to remove the stuffing.</p></li>

To understand this, we need to keep in mind that hosts can use other network-layer protocols besides IP. In fact, a given host may support multiple network-layer protocols using different protocols for different applications. <span class="pagebreak" title="477" id="P70010119520000000000000000025C5" data-uri="M06_KURO4140_07_SE_C06.xhtml#P70010119520000000000000000025C5" epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>For this reason, when the Ethernet frame arrives at adapter B, adapter B needs to know to which network-layer protocol it should pass (that is, demultiplex) the contents of the data field. IP and other network-layer protocols (for example, Novell IPX or AppleTalk) each have their own, standardized type number. Furthermore, the ARP protocol (discussed in the previous section) has its own type number, and if the arriving frame contains an ARP packet (i.e., has a type field of 0806 hexadecimal), the ARP packet will be demultiplexed up to the ARP protocol. Note that the type field is analogous to the protocol field in the network-layer datagram and the port-number fields in the transport-layer segment; all of these fields serve to glue a protocol at one layer to a protocol at the layer above.</p></li>

Each of the first 7 bytes of the preamble has a value of 10101010; the last byte is 10101011. The first 7 bytes of the preamble serve to “wake up” the receiving adapters and to synchronize their clocks to that of the sender’s clock. Why should the clocks be out of synchronization? Keep in mind that adapter A aims to transmit the frame at 10 Mbps, 100 Mbps, or 1 Gbps, depending on the type of Ethernet LAN. However, because nothing is absolutely perfect, adapter A will not transmit the frame at exactly the target rate; there will always be some <i>drift</i> from the target rate, a drift which is not known <i>a priori</i> by the other adapters on the LAN. A receiving adapter can lock onto adapter A’s clock simply by locking onto the bits in the first 7 bytes of the preamble. The last 2 bits of the eighth byte of the preamble (the first two consecutive 1s) alert adapter B that the “important stuff” is about to come.</p></li>

That is, when adapter A wants to send a datagram to adapter B, adapter A encapsulates the datagram in an Ethernet frame and sends the frame into the LAN, without first handshaking with adapter B. This layer-2 connectionless service is analogous to IP’s layer-3 datagram service and UDP’s layer-4 connectionless service.</p>

Specifically, when adapter B receives a frame from adapter A, it runs the frame through a CRC check, but neither sends an acknowledgment when a frame passes the CRC check nor sends a negative acknowledgment when a frame fails the CRC check. When a frame fails the CRC check, adapter B simply discards the frame. Thus, adapter A has no idea whether its transmitted frame reached adapter B and passed the CRC check. This lack of reliable transport (at the link layer) helps to make Ethernet simple and cheap. But it also means that the stream of datagrams passed to the network layer can have gaps.</p>

During his studies, he also became exposed to Abramson’s work on ALOHA and random access protocols. After completing his PhD and just before beginning a job at Xerox Palo Alto Research Center (Xerox PARC), he visited Abramson and his University of Hawaii colleagues for three months, getting a firsthand look at ALOHAnet. At Xerox PARC, Metcalfe became exposed to Alto computers, which in many ways were the forerunners of the personal computers of the 1980s. Metcalfe saw the need to network these computers in an inexpensive manner. So armed with his knowledge about ARPAnet, ALOHAnet, and random access protocols, Metcalfe—along with colleague David Boggs—invented Ethernet.</p>

Metcalfe and Boggs succeeded at getting most of the researchers at Xerox PARC to communicate through their Alto computers. Metcalfe then forged an alliance between Xerox, Digital, and Intel to establish Ethernet as a 10 Mbps Ethernet standard, ratified by the IEEE. Xerox did not show much interest in commercializing Ethernet. In 1979, Metcalfe formed his own company, 3Com, which developed and commercialized networking technology, including Ethernet technology. In particular, 3Com developed and marketed Ethernet cards in the early 1980s for the immensely popular IBM PCs.</p>

If the application is using UDP, then the application in Host B will indeed see gaps in the data. On the other hand, if the application is using TCP, then TCP in Host B will not acknowledge the data contained in discarded frames, causing TCP in Host A to retransmit. Note that when TCP retransmits data, the data will eventually return to the Ethernet adapter at which it was discarded. Thus, in this sense, Ethernet does retransmit data, although Ethernet is unaware of whether it is transmitting a brand-new datagram with brand-new data, or a datagram that contains data that has already been transmitted at least once.</p>

But in fact, Ethernet comes in <i>many</i> different flavors, with somewhat bewildering acronyms such as 10BASE-T, 10BASE-2, 100BASE-T, 1000BASE-LX, <span class="pagebreak" title="479" id="P70010119520000000000000000025D7" data-uri="M06_KURO4140_07_SE_C06.xhtml#P70010119520000000000000000025D7" epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>10GBASE-T and 40GBASE-T. These and many other Ethernet technologies have been standardized over the years by the IEEE 802.3 CSMA/CD (Ethernet) working group <a class="biblioref" href="fileP70010119520000000000000000037E0.xhtml#P7001011952000000000000000003987" data-foobar="7">[IEEE 802.3 2012]</a>. While these acronyms may appear bewildering, there is actually considerable order here. The first part of the acronym refers to the speed of the standard: 10, 100, 1000, or 10G, for 10 Megabit (per second), 100 Megabit, Gigabit, 10 Gigabit and 40 Gigibit Ethernet, respectively. “BASE” refers to baseband Ethernet, meaning that the physical media only carries Ethernet traffic; almost all of the 802.3 standards are for baseband Ethernet. The final part of the acronym refers to the physical media itself; Ethernet is both a link-layer <i>and</i> a physical-layer specification and is carried over a variety of physical media including coaxial cable, copper wire, and fiber. Generally, a “T” refers to twisted-pair copper wires.</p>

The early 10BASE-2 and 10BASE-5 standards specify 10 Mbps Ethernet over two types of coaxial cable, each limited in length to 500 meters. Longer runs could be obtained by using a <span class="keyword" id="P70010119520000000000000000025D9" data-uri="M06_KURO4140_07_SE_C06.xhtml#P70010119520000000000000000025D9"><b>repeater</b></span>—a physical-layer device that receives a signal on the input side, and regenerates the signal on the output side. A coaxial cable corresponds nicely to our view of Ethernet as a broadcast medium—all frames transmitted by one interface are received at other interfaces, and Ethernet’s CDMA/CD protocol nicely solves the multiple access problem. Nodes simply attach to the cable, and <i>voila</i>, we have a local area network!</p>

In the days of bus topologies and hub-based star topologies, Ethernet was clearly a broadcast link (as defined in <a class="xref" href="fileP700101195200000000000000000245F.xhtml#P700101195200000000000000000245F" data-foobar="7"><span class="label">Section</span> <span class="number">6.3</span></a>) in which frame collisions occurred when nodes transmitted at the same time. To deal with these collisions, the Ethernet standard included the CSMA/CD protocol, which is particularly effective for a wired broadcast LAN spanning a small geographical region. But if the prevalent use of Ethernet today is a switch-based star topology, using store-and-forward packet switching, is there really a need anymore for an Ethernet MAC protocol? As we’ll see shortly, a switch coordinates its transmissions and never forwards more than one frame onto the same interface at any time. Furthermore, modern switches are full-duplex, so that a switch and a node can each send frames to each other at the same time without interference. In other words, in a switch-based Ethernet LAN there are no collisions and, therefore, there is no need for a MAC protocol!</p>
<p id="P700101195200000000000000000B0A9" data-uri="M06_KURO4140_07_SE_C06.xhtml#P700101195200000000000000000B0A9">As we’ve seen, today’s Ethernets are <i>very</i> different from the original Ethernet conceived by Metcalfe and Boggs more than 30 years ago—speeds have increased by three orders of magnitude, Ethernet frames are carried over a variety of media, switched-Ethernets have become dominant, and now even the MAC protocol is often unnecessary! Is all of this <i>really</i> still Ethernet? The answer, of course, is “yes, by definition.” It is interesting to note, however, that through all of these changes, there <span class="pagebreak" title="481" id="P70010119520000000000000000025F1" data-uri="M06_KURO4140_07_SE_C06.xhtml#P70010119520000000000000000025F1" epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>has indeed been one enduring constant that has remained unchanged over 30 years—Ethernet’s frame format. Perhaps this then is the one true and timeless centerpiece of the Ethernet standard.</p>

The rate at which frames arrive to any one of the switch’s output interfaces may temporarily exceed the link capacity of that interface. To accommodate this problem, switch output interfaces have buffers, in much the same way that router output interfaces have buffers for datagrams. Let’s now take a closer look at how switches operate.</p>

Suppose that a frame with destination address 62-FE-F7-11-89-A3 arrives at the switch from interface 1. The switch examines its table and sees that the destination is on the LAN segment connected to interface 1 (that is, Electrical Engineering). This means that the frame has already been broadcast on the LAN segment that contains the destination. The switch therefore filters (that is, discards) the frame. Now suppose a frame with the same destination address arrives from interface 2. The switch again examines its table and sees that the destination is in the direction of interface 1; it therefore forwards the frame to the output buffer preceding interface 1. It should be clear from this example that as long as the switch table is complete and accurate, the switch forwards frames toward destinations without any broadcasting.</p>

We can identify several advantages of using switches, rather than broadcast links such as buses or hub-based star topologies:</p>
<ul id="P700101195200000000000000000B0CD" data-uri="M06_KURO4140_07_SE_C06.xhtml#P700101195200000000000000000B0CD">

The switches buffer frames and never transmit more than one frame on a segment at any one time. As with a router, the maximum aggregate throughput of a switch is the sum of all the switch interface rates. Thus, switches provide a significant performance improvement over LANs with broadcast links.</p></li>

For example, the uppermost switch in <a class="xref" href="#P7001011952000000000000000002550" data-foobar="1"><span class="label">Figure</span> <span class="number">6.15</span></a> might have three1 Gbps 1000BASE-T copper links, two 100 Mbps 100BASE-FX fiber links, and one 100BASE-T copper link.

For example, if an adapter malfunctions and continually sends Ethernet frames (called a jabbering adapter), a switch can detect the problem and internally disconnect the malfunctioning adapter. With this feature, the network administrator need not get out of bed and drive back to work in order to correct the problem. Similarly, a cable cut disconnects only that host that was using the cut cable to connect to the switch. In the days of coaxial cable, many a network manager spent hours “walking the line” (or more accurately, “crawling the floor”) to find the cable break that brought down the entire network. Switches also gather statistics on bandwidth usage, collision rates, and traffic types, and make this information available to the network manager. This information can be used to debug and correct problems, and to plan how the LAN should evolve in the future. Researchers are exploring adding yet more management functionality into Ethernet LANs in prototype deployments <a class="biblioref" href="fileP70010119520000000000000000037E0.xhtml#P7001011952000000000000000003860" data-foobar="7">[Casado 2007</a>; <a class="biblioref" href="fileP70010119520000000000000000037E0.xhtml#P70010119520000000000000000039F9" data-foobar="7">Koponen 2011]</a>.</p></li>

For example, consider a switched LAN in <a class="xref" href="#P700101195200000000000000000257E" data-foobar="1"><span class="label">Figure</span> <span class="number">6.17</span></a>. When host A sends a frame to host B, and there is an entry for host B in the switch table, then the switch will forward the frame <i>only</i> to host B. If host C happens to be running a sniffer, host C will not be able to sniff this A-to-B frame. Thus, in a switched-LAN environment (in contrast to a broadcast link environment such as 802.11 LANs or hub–based Ethernet LANs), it is more difficult for an attacker to sniff frames. <i>However</i>, because the switch broadcasts frames that have destination addresses that are not in the switch table, the sniffer at C can still sniff some frames that are not intended for C. Furthermore, a sniffer will be able sniff all Ethernet broadcast frames with broadcast destination address FF–FF–FF–FF–FF–FF. A well-known attack against a switch, called <span class="keyword" id="P7001011952000000000000000002632" data-uri="M06_KURO4140_07_SE_C06.xhtml#P7001011952000000000000000002632"><b>switch poisoning</b></span>, is to send tons of packets to the switch with many different bogus source MAC addresses, thereby filling the switch table with bogus entries and leaving no room for the MAC addresses of the legitimate hosts. This causes the switch to broadcast most frames, which can then be picked up by the sniffer <a class="biblioref" href="fileP70010119520000000000000000037E0.xhtml#P7001011952000000000000000003C16" data-foobar="7">[Skoudis 2006]</a>.

As mentioned above, switches are plug-and-play, a property that is cherished by all the overworked network administrators of the world. Switches can also have relatively high filtering and forwarding rates—as shown in <a class="xref" href="#P7001011952000000000000000002638" data-foobar="1"><span class="label">Figure</span> <span class="number">6.24</span></a>, switches have to process frames only up through layer 2, whereas routers have to process datagrams up through layer 3. On the other hand, to prevent the cycling of broadcast frames, the active topology of a switched network is restricted to a spanning tree. Also, a large switched network would require large ARP tables in the hosts and routers and would generate substantial ARP traffic and processing. Furthermore, switches are susceptible to broadcast storms—if one host goes haywire and transmits an endless stream of Ethernet broadcast frames, the switches will forward all of these frames, causing the entire network to collapse.</p>
<p id="P700101195200000000000000000B0DF" data-uri="M06_KURO4140_07_SE_C06.xhtml#P700101195200000000000000000B0DF">Now consider the pros and cons of routers. Because network addressing is often hierarchical (and not flat, as is MAC addressing), packets do not normally cycle through routers even when the network has redundant paths. (However, packets can cycle when router tables are misconfigured; but as we learned in <a class="xref" href="fileP70010119520000000000000000019C1.xhtml#P70010119520000000000000000019C1" data-foobar="7"><span class="label">Chapter</span> <span class="number">4</span></a>, IP uses a special datagram header field to limit the cycling.) Thus, packets are not restricted to a spanning tree and can use the best path between source and destination. Because routers do not have the spanning tree restriction, they have allowed the Internet to be built with a rich topology that includes, for example, multiple active links between Europe and North America. Another feature of routers is that they provide firewall protection against layer-2 broadcast storms. Perhaps the most significant drawback of routers, though, is that they are not plug-and-play—they and the hosts that connect to them need their IP addresses to be configured. Also, routers often have a larger per-packet processing time than switches, because they have to process up through the layer-3 fields. Finally, there are two different ways to pronounce the word <i>router</i>, either as “rootor” or as “rowter,” and people waste a lot of time arguing over the proper pronunciation <a class="biblioref" href="fileP70010119520000000000000000037E0.xhtml#P7001011952000000000000000003AA9" data-foobar="7">[Perlman 1999]</a>.</p>

Typically, small networks consisting of a few hundred hosts have a few LAN segments. Switches suffice for these small networks, as they localize traffic and increase aggregate throughput without requiring any configuration of IP addresses. But larger networks consisting of thousands of hosts typically include routers within the network (in addition to switches). The routers provide a more robust isolation of traffic, control broadcast storms, and use more “intelligent” routes among the hosts in the network.</p>

How can traffic from the EE Department be sent to the CS Department? One way to handle this would be to connect a VLAN switch port (e.g., port 1 in <a class="xref" href="#P7001011952000000000000000002664" data-foobar="1"><span class="label">Figure</span> <span class="number">6.25</span></a>) to an external router and configure that port to belong both the EE and CS VLANs. In this case, even though the EE and CS departments share the same physical switch, the logical configuration would look as if the EE and CS departments had separate switches connected via a router. An IP datagram going from the EE to the CS department would first cross the EE VLAN to reach the router and then be forwarded by the router back over the CS VLAN to the CS host. Fortunately, switch vendors make such configurations easy for the network manager by building a single device that contains both a VLAN switch <i>and</i> a router, so a separate external router is not needed. A homework problem at the end of the chapter explores this scenario in more detail.</p>

But how should these two switches be interconnected? One easy solution would be to define a port belonging to the CS VLAN on each switch (similarly for the EE VLAN) and to connect these ports to each other, as shown in <a class="xref" href="#P700101195200000000000000000267D" data-foobar="1"><span class="label">Figure</span> <span class="number">6.26</span>(a)</a>.

The trunk port belongs to all VLANs, and frames sent to any VLAN are forwarded over the trunk link to the other switch. But this raises yet another question: How does a switch know that a frame arriving on a trunk port belongs to a particular VLAN? The IEEE has defined an extended Ethernet frame format, 802.1Q, for frames crossing a VLAN trunk.

We should also mention that VLANs can be defined in several other ways. In MAC-based VLANs, the network manager specifies the set of MAC addresses that belong to each VLAN; whenever a device attaches to a port, the port is connected into the appropriate VLAN based on the MAC address of the device. VLANs can also be defined based on network-layer protocols (e.g., IPv4, IPv6, or Appletalk) and other criteria. It is also possible for VLANs to be extended across IP routers, allowing islands of LANs to be connected together to form a single VLAN that could span the globe <a class="biblioref" href="fileP70010119520000000000000000037E0.xhtml#P7001011952000000000000000003C98" data-foobar="7">[Yu 2011]</a>.
