Many of the key papers are published only on the website of a particular blockchain. The <span class="s44">URL</span>s for those references are likely to change often. Thus, web searches for key topics are a highly important source for further reading. Here, we cite some classic references as well as <span class="s44">URL</span>s current as of the publication date.</p><p class="s64" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 119pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;">Further Reading  <span class="s164">1283</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 119pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">The original Bitcoin paper [Nakamoto (2008)] is authored under a pseudonym, with the identity of the author or authors still the subject of speculation. The original Ethereum paper [Buterin (2013)] has been superseded by newer Ethereum white pa- pers (see <span class="s49">ethereum.org</span>), but the original work by Ethereum’s creator, Vitalik Buterin, remains interesting reading. Solidity, the primary programming language for Ethereum smart contracts, is discussed in <span class="s49">solidity.readthedocs.io</span>. The <span class="s44">ERC</span>-20 standard is de- scribed in [Vogelsteller and Buterin (2013)] and the proposed (as of the publication date of this text) Casper upgrade to the performance of Ethereum’s consensus mech- anism appears in [Buterin and Griﬃth (2017)]. Another approach to using proof-of- stake is used by the Cardano blockchain (<span class="s49">www.cardano.org</span>).</p><p style="padding-left: 119pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">Many of the theoretical results that make blockchain possible were ﬁrst developed in the 20th century. The concepts behind cryptographic hash functions and public-key encryption were introduced in [Diﬃe and Hellman (1976)] and [Rivest et al. (1978)]. A good reference for cryptography is [Katz and Lindell (2014)]. [Narayanan et al. (2016)] is a good reference for the basics of cryptocurrency, though its focus is mainly on Bitcoin. There is a large body of literature on Byzantine consensus. Early papers that laid the foundation for this work include [Pease et al. (1980)] and [Lamport et al. (1982)]. Practical Byzantine fault tolerance ([Castro and Liskov (1999)]) serves as the basis for much of the current blockchain Byzantine consensus algorithms. [Mazi`eres (2016)] describes in detail a consensus protocol speciﬁcally designed to allow for open, rather than permissioned, membership in the consensus group. References pertaining to Merkle trees appears in Chapter 23. Patricia trees were introduced in [Morrison (1968)].</p><p style="padding-left: 119pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">A benchmarking framework for permissioned blockchains appears in [Dinh et al. (2017)]. A detailed comparison of blockchain systems appears in [Dinh et al. (2018)]. ForkBase, a storage system designed for improved blockchain performance, is dis- cussed in [Wang et al. (2018)].</p><p style="padding-left: 119pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">The Lightning network(<span class="s49">lightning.network</span>) aims to accelerate Bitcoin transactions and provide some degree of cross-chain transactions. Ripple (<span class="s49">ripple.com</span>) provides a network for international ﬁat currency exchange using the <span class="s44">XRP </span>token. Loopring (<span class="s49">loopring.org</span>) is a cryptocurrency exchange platform that allows users to retain con- trol of their currency without having to surrender control to the exchange.</p><p style="padding-left: 119pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">Many of the blockchains discussed in the chapter have their best descriptions on their respective web sites. These include Corda (<span class="s49">docs.corda.net</span>), Iota (<span class="s49">iota.org</span>), and Hyperledger (<span class="s49">www.hyperledger.org</span><a href="http://www.jpmorgan.com/global/Quorum)" class="s87" target="_blank">). Many ﬁnancial ﬁrms are creating their own blockchains, and some of those are publicly available, including J.P. Morgan’s Quorum (</a><a href="http://www.jpmorgan.com/global/Quorum)" class="s56" target="_blank">www.jpmorgan.com/global/Quorum</a><a href="http://www.jpmorgan.com/global/Quorum)" class="s87" target="_blank">).</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part474.htm">&lt; 上一个</a><span> | </span><a href="../database.html">内容</a><span> | </span><a href="part476.htm">下一个 &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
