				<p style="font-family:Times New Roman;">I'm gonna fill in positive energy everyday. This paragraph should be in <b>Times New Roman</b> font (others articles could be in <b style="font-family:'Neo Euler';">Neo-Euler</b> font). If not, please install the font on your device. </p>
				<p><b>Note</b>: If you haven't configured the default font in your browser, the articles converted from <code>org</code>  will look considerably ugly. <code>code</code> should be in <code>Consolas</code> font.</p>
				<p><b>Yet Another Note</b>: <code>text-align: justify;</code> which is to say that the text is double alignment, which could be considerably ugly under certain circumstances.</p>

                <h1>What I dit <time datetime="2023-04-22">today</time>(2023-04-22)</h1>
                <p>I slept at 5:00 am yesterday. I felt extremely good. So quiet. No noise. Like in heaven.</p>

                <h1>What I did <time datetime="2023-04-21">today</time>(2023-04-21)</h1>
                <p>I shall introduce a concept called <em>nested snippets</em>. When you employ another snippet inside of one snippet, the cursor should jump normally, that is to say, the inner snippet shall not cancel the <em>jump</em> of the outer snippet. The snippet plugin called <em>hypersnips</em> has the exact problem. Bad. And it is better to use different key for <em>jump</em> and <em>span</em>, or one can't use inner snippets at the first place.</p>
                <p>I finished experiment. 真他妈傻逼 我操.</p>


                <h1>What I did <time datetime="2023-04-20">today</time>(2023-04-20)</h1>
                <p>I just figured that this title is better. The previous one is a question, but this one is a noun phrase. More like a title.</p>
                <p>Anyway, I proceeded to learning Java Shit. Indeed shit. With no doubt. Absolute shit.</p>
                <h1><code>Org</code> and Emacs</h1>
                <p><code>Org mode</code> is very interesting. You can appoint the style sheet that will be used by the exported html file. To do this, you shall use the following code in your <code>file</code></p>
                <pre class="example">
#+HTML_HEAD: &lt;link rel = "stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css"/&gt;
#+OPTIONS: html-style:nil</pre>
                <p>The first sentence tells Emacs to include the code in the head of the <code>html</code> file. The second sentence tells Emacs to disable the default style sheet.</p>

                <p>And it is very simple to add <code>yasnippets</code> snippets since the plugin has already provided us with some useful keybindings to create snippets and try out snippets. And it is especially convenient compared to the <code>Ultisnips</code> in Vim. You can quickly insert a snippet and then go back to work with no pressure. The snippets source is automatically renewed (Okay, so is <code>Ultisnips</code>). Anyway, since that the installation of the plugins in Emacs is much easier (unless you are not in China), and since that the <code>M-x</code> can easily list numbers of the available commands and variables, I think Emacs is, in this scenario, more convient than Vim. Mostly
                because the plugin experience is much better (Of
                course, that is because of the Wall).</p>
                <p>I don't know which editor is better, for real. One may think that there are a lot of useful features in Emacs, while one may think that Emacs is like a shit mountain, with a ton of useless things.</p>
                <h2>The experiment</h2>
                <p>The shitty experiment is half-done rightnow. Holy shit! But I forgot to write the homework of automata theory(To be honest, I am not that willing to call "it" <b>automata theory</b>. Only the shameless calls it "theory".</p>

                <h1>What did I do <time datetime="2023-04-19">today</time>(2023-04-19)?</h1>
                <p>Literally nothing...Man! People do nothing everyday.</p>
                <p>Hey I learnt some cool stuffs about the <code>org mode</code>. It is so cool. Do you know that MathJax is employed by default when you export the org mode file to html file? Insane. Highly productive! Emacs should introduce a Vim mode to edit file. I will never turn off Emacs if there were such thing.</p>
                <p>Hey I just learnt that you can check the help documentation of the current mode by pressing <code>C-h m</code>.</p>
                <p>Yet another paragraph. You should try using <code>yasnippets</code>. It would be better if I can find its documentation. And I become kinda insterested to the study of colors. Everybody knows that the color in WEP is great. But the questions is how to describe how good it is. On the other hand, after watching the ep.2 of U149, I realized that color is seldon mentioned.</p>

           		<h1>What did I do <time datetime="2023-04-18">today</time>(2023-04-18)?</h1>
				<p>Literally nothing...</p>
				<p>I wrote the note on <a href="art/note/j09.html" target="_blank">Chapter 09</a>. What a shame...</p>

				<h1>What did I do <time datetime="2023-04-17">today</time>(2023-04-17)?</h1>
				<p>Literally nothing.</p>
				<p>I wrote three chapters of Java. They are shit, for sure. Here are the links to them.</p>
				<ul>
					<li><a href="art/note/j06.html">Chapter 06</a></li>
					<li><a href="art/note/j07.html">Chapter 07</a></li>
					<li><a href="art/note/j08.html">Chapter 08</a></li>
				</ul>
				<p>They are indeed piece of shit.
				    <p>Chapter 06 is about black box and white box testing. </p>
				    <p>Chapter 07 is about <code>Set</code> and <code>List</code> class in Java. And is about the <b>Strategy pattern</b> and <b>iterator pattern</b>.</p>
				    <p>Chapter 08 is about <code>DAO</code> and file manipulations. We use <code>DAO</code> to manage the storation of the data. And we use file manipulation to implement the <code>DAO</code> using file system, to do which we need to know the manipulations on files. Lastly, we learnt <b>serialization</b>, we can use which to write objects to local files. When doing it, we shall use a list (you may call it container) to store those objects and write the container to the local file.</p>
				    <p>And I have to say that <code>org mode</code> is not that pleasing. What a pile of shit. Hard to use. And the manual is like shit. Everybody knows that an enumeration is like shit, but the manual has only enumerations.</p>

				    <h1>What did I do <time datetime="2023-04-16">today</time>(2023-04-16)?</h1>
				    <p><b>Literally nothing</b>.</p>
				    <p>I finish doing some of homework. What a complete shit. What a waste of life. Shit.</p>
				    <p>Ok, I learned what is <b>Lagrange interpolation</b> and what is <b>Newton interpolation</b>. Okay that is all. MG.</p>

				    <h1>What did I do <time datetime="2023-04-15">today</time>(2023-04-15)?</h1>
				    <p>Literally nothing</p>
				    <p>But I read the first three episode of <b>金瓶梅</b>. <b>Ep</b>.3 is great. And I just learn what is an <b>auxiliary verb</b>. And I just installed a extension for web browser to employ vim keybinding in browser.</p>

				    <h1>What did I do <time datetime="2023-04-14">today</time>?</h1>

				    <h2>I learned a little bit Japanese.</h2>
				    <p>I admit, linguistics is boring. I mean, to be honest, I don't care about the
				        genetic affiliation of Japanese or anything about Old Japanese. </p>
				    <p>You may check the article named <cite>book_01_intro</cite> in <a href="art/japanese.html" target="_blank">Japanese</a>.</p>

				    <h1>What did I do today?</h1>
				    <h2>I wrote an article about how to edit cards in Anki.</h2>
				    <ul>
					    <li><a href="art/anki_editing.html" target="_blank">Anki</a></li>
