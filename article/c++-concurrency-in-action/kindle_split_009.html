      <p class="noind">Anthony Williams is a UK-based developer, consultant, and trainer with over 20 years of experience in C++. He has been an
         active member of the BSI C++ Standards Panel since 2001, and is the author or coauthor of many of the C++ Standards Committee
         papers that led up to the inclusion of the thread library in the C++11 Standard. He continues to work on new facilities to
         enhance the C++ concurrency toolkit, both with standards proposals, and implementations of those facilities for the just::thread
         Pro extensions to the C++ thread library from Just Software Solutions Ltd. Anthony lives in the far west of Cornwall, England.
