      <p class="noind">I will start by saying a big “Thank you” to my wife, Kim, for all the love and support she has given me while writing this
         book. The first edition occupied a significant part of my spare time for the four years before publication, and the second
         edition has again required a significant investment of time, and without her patience, support, and understanding, I couldn’t
         have managed it.
      </p>
      
      <p class="noind">Second, I would like to thank the team at Manning who have made this book possible: Marjan Bace, publisher; Michael Stephens,
         associate publisher; Cynthia Kane, my development editor; Aleksandar Dragosavljević, review editor; Safis Editing and Heidi
         Ward, my copyeditors; and Melody Dolab, my proofreader. Without their efforts you would not be reading this book right now.
      </p>
      
      <p class="noind">I would also like to thank the other members of the C++ Standards Committee who wrote committee papers on the multithreading
         facilities: Andrei Alexandrescu, Pete Becker, Bob Blainer, Hans Boehm, Beman Dawes, Lawrence Crowl, Peter Dimov, Jeff Garland,
         Kevlin Henney, Howard Hinnant, Ben Hutchings, Jan Kristofferson, Doug Lea, Paul McKenney, Nick McLaren, Clark Nelson, Bill
         Pugh, Raul Silvera, Herb Sutter, Detlef Vollmann, and Michael Wong, plus all those who commented on the papers, discussed
         them at the committee meetings, and otherwise helped shaped the multithreading and concurrency support in C++11, C++14, C++17,
         and the Concurrency TS.
      </p>
      
      <p class="noind">Finally, I would like to thank the following people, whose suggestions have greatly improved this book: Dr. Jamie Allsop,
         Peter Dimov, Howard Hinnant, Rick Molloy, Jonathan Wakely, and Dr. Russel Winder, with special thanks to Russel for his detailed
         reviews and to Frédéric Flayol, who, as technical proofreader, painstakingly checked all the content for outright errors in
         the final manuscript during production. (Any remaining mistakes are, of course, all mine.) In addition, I’d like to thank
         my panel of reviewers for the second edition: Al Norman, Andrei de Araújo Formiga, Chad Brewbaker, Dwight Wilkins, Hugo Filipe
         Lopes, Vieira Durana, Jura Shikin, Kent R. Spillner, Maria Gemini, Mateusz Malenta, Maurizio Tomasi, Nat Luengnaruemitchai,
         Robert C. Green II, Robert Trausmuth, Sanchir Kartiev, and Steven Parr. Also, thanks to the readers of the MEAP edition who
         took the time to point out errors or highlight areas that needed clarifying.
