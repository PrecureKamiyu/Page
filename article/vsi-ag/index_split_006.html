<p class="calibre_3">I should like to thank again my collaborators on <em class="calibre4">The Cambridge History of Ancient Greece</em>: Sue Alcock (now of Brown University), Nick Fisher (University of Wales, Cardiff), Marilyn Katz (Wesleyan University), Edith Hall (now Royal Holloway University of London), Karim Arafat (King’s College London), Catherine Morgan (now Director of the British School at Athens), Lesley Dean-Jones (University of Texas at Austin), and Richard Buxton (Bristol University); and the other colleagues and friends, too, on the continent of Europe (especially in Greece), in Africa, in America North and South, in Australasia, and in Japan, who have in some way or other contributed to the text that follows. There are too many to name them all individually, but two do require special mention: Robert Garland (Colgate University) and Polly Low (University of Manchester), who both at extremely short notice read and commented expertly on an entire near-final draft. And I must not forget the Press’s ‘anonymous reader’, who saved me from considerable embarrassment. Were it not for their kindness and collegiality, this book would have been even more imperfect than it is. I count myself exceedingly fortunate, too, to be writing at a time when the modern historiography of ancient Greece is experiencing something of a boom, <a></a>and, not least, when outreach to wider publics than just one’s fellow-specialists is considered a (pleasurable) duty rather than a luxury.</p>
<p class="calibre_12">It is in that same spirit of striving for outreach that I was deeply honoured to have my personal chair in Cambridge’s Faculty of Classics endowed in perpetuity as the A. G. Leventis Professorship of Greek Culture (with effect from 1 October 2008). This book is one of the first fruits of that charity, and it is dedicated, in a spirit of ineffable <em class="calibre4">kharis</em>, to the Trustees of the A. G. Leventis Foundation.<a></a></p>  <div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_10"></div>
