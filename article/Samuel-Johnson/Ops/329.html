<h2 class="h20"><a id="a769"></a>No. 30. SATURDAY, DECEMBER 23, 1758.</h2>
<p class="p21">The great differences that disturb the peace of mankind are not about ends, but means. We have all the same general desires, but how those desires shall be accomplished will for ever be disputed. The ultimate purpose of government is temporal, and that of religion is eternal happiness. Hitherto we agree; but here we must part, to try, according to the endless varieties of passion and understanding combined with one another, every possible form of government, and every imaginable tenet of religion.</p>
<p class="p24">We are told by Cumberland that <span class="t8">rectitude</span>, applied to action or contemplation, is merely metaphorical; and that as a <span class="t8">right</span> line describes the shortest passage from point to point, so a <span class="t8">right</span> action effects a good design by the fewest means; and so likewise a <span class="t8">right</span> opinion is that which connects distant truths by the shortest train of intermediate propositions.</p>
<p class="p24">To find the nearest way from truth to truth, or from purpose to effect, not to use more instruments where fewer will be sufficient; not to move by wheels and levers what will give way to the naked hand, is the great proof of a healthful and vigorous mind, neither feeble with helpless ignorance, nor overburdened with unwieldy knowledge.</p>
<p class="p24">But there are men who seem to think nothing so much the characteristick of a genius, as to do common things in an uncommon manner; like Hudibras, to <span class="t8">tell the clock by algebra</span>; or like the lady in Dr. Young&rsquo;s satires, <span class="t8">to drink tea by stratagem</span>; to quit the beaten track, only because it is known, and take a new path, however crooked or rough, because the straight was found out before.</p>
<p class="p24">Every man speaks and writes with intent to be understood; and it can seldom happen but he that understands himself, might convey his notions to another, if, content to be understood, he did not seek to be admired; but when once he begins to contrive how his sentiments may be received, not with most ease to his reader, but with most advantage to himself, he then transfers his consideration from words to sounds, from sentences to periods, and as he grows more elegant becomes less intelligible.</p>
<p class="p24">It is difficult to enumerate every species of authors whose labours counteract themselves; the man of exuberance and copiousness, who diffuses every thought through so many diversities of expression, that it is lost like water in a mist; the ponderous dictator of sentences, whose notions are delivered in the lump, and are, like uncoined bullion, of more weight than use; the liberal illustrator, who shows by examples and comparisons what was clearly seen when it was first proposed; and the stately son of demonstration, who proves with mathematical formality what no man has yet pretended to doubt.</p>
<p class="p24">There is a mode of style for which I know not that the masters of oratory have yet found a name; a style by which the most evident truths are so obscured that they can no longer be perceived, and the most familiar propositions so disguised that they cannot be known. Every other kind of eloquence is the dress of sense; but this is the mask by which a true master of his art will so effectually conceal it, that a man will as easily mistake his own positions, if he meets them thus transformed, as he may pass in a masquerade his nearest acquaintance.</p>
<p class="p24">This style may be called the <span class="t8">terrifick</span>, for its chief intention is to terrify and amaze; it may be termed the <span class="t8">repulsive</span>, for its natural effect is to drive away the reader; or it may be distinguished, in plain English, by the denomination of the <span class="t8">bugbear style</span>, for it has more terrour than danger, and will appear less formidable as it is more nearly approached.</p>
<p class="p24">A mother tells her infant, that <span class="t8">two and two make four</span>; the child remembers the proposition, and is able to count four to all the purposes of life, till the course of his education brings him among philosophers, who fright him from his former knowledge, by telling him, that four is a certain aggregate of units; that all numbers being only the repetition of an unit, which, though not a number itself, is the parent, root, or original of all number, <span class="t8">four</span> is the denomination assigned to a certain number of such repetitions. The only danger is, lest, when he first hears these dreadful sounds, the pupil should run away; if he has but the courage to stay till the conclusion, he will find that, when speculation has done its worst, two and two still make four.</p>
<p class="p24">An illustrious example of this species of eloquence may be found in &ldquo;Letters concerning Mind.&rdquo; The author begins by declaring, that &ldquo;the sorts of things are things that now are, have been, and shall be, and the things that strictly <span class="t8">are</span>.&rdquo; In this position, except the last clause, in which he uses something of the scholastick language, there is nothing but what every man has heard, and imagines himself to know. But who would not believe that some wonderful novelty is presented to his intellect, when he is afterwards told, in the true bugbear style, that &ldquo;the <span class="t8">ares</span>, in the former sense, are things that lie between the <span class="t8">have-beens</span> and <span class="t8">shall-bes</span>. The <span class="t8">have-beens</span> are things that are past; the <span class="t8">shall-bes</span> are things that are to come; and the things that <span class="t8">are</span>, in the latter sense, are things that have not been, nor shall be, nor stand in the midst of such as are before them, or shall be after them. The things that <span class="t8">have been</span>, and <span class="t8">shall be</span>, have respect to present, past, and future.</p>
<p class="p24">&ldquo;Those likewise that now <span class="t8">are</span> have moreover place; that, for instance, which is here, that which is to the east, that which is to the west.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">All this, my dear reader, is very strange; but though it be strange, it is not new; survey these wonderful sentences again, and they will be found to contain nothing more than very plain truths, which, till this author arose, had always been delivered in plain language.</p>
<p class="p24">These &ldquo;Letters on Mind&rdquo; were written by a Mr. Petvin, who after some years again astounded the literary public by sending forth, in diction equally terrific, another tract entitled a &ldquo;Summary of the Soul&rsquo;s Perceptive Faculties,&rdquo; 1768. He was at that time compared to Duns Scotus, the subtle Doctor, who, in the weakness of old age, wept because he could not understand the subtleties of his earlier writings.</p>
