<p class="calibre_3">By inclination I prefer to transliterate rather than anglicize ancient Greek names and words, but even I write Aeschylus and Thucydides, not Aiskhulos and Thoukudides. Here I have deviated from strict transliteration in various, not always consistent ways—a truly British compromise (or muddle): thus, for example, Cnossos, not Knossos (transliteration), nor Cnossus (Latin). But one outstanding exception had to be made—for Byzantion (the city); this in order to avoid confusion with anglicized, Latinate Byzantium (either a civilization or an epoch—during which ‘Byzantion’, as the city-name, ‘got the works’ in favour of ‘Konstantinoupolis’—Constantinople). Where I place a circumflex over the ‘e’ or ’o’ of a transliterated ancient Greek word, that is to indicate, especially in cases where transliteration might lead to misunderstanding, that the vowel was long—or ‘big’ as the Greeks said: <em class="calibre4">omicron</em> = (literally) small ‘o’, <em class="calibre4">ômega</em> = big ‘o’. Greek short ‘e’, <em class="calibre4">epsilon</em>, meant ‘light “e” ’; the long version was called ‘êta’.</p>  <div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_14"></div>
