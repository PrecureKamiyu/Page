<h2 class="h20"><a id="ncx39212"></a>THE LIFE OF SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.</h2>
<p class="p21">In 1764 and 1765 it should seem that Dr. Johnson was so busily employed with his edition of Shakspeare, as to have had little leisure for any other literary exertion, or, indeed, even for private correspondence. He did not favour me with a single letter for more than two years, for which it will appear that he afterwards apologised.</p>
<p class="p24">He was, however, at all times ready to give assistance to his friends, and others, in revising their works, and in writing for them, or greatly improving their Dedications. In that courtly species of composition no man excelled Dr. Johnson. Though the loftiness of his mind prevented him from ever dedicating in his own person, he wrote a very great number of Dedications for others. Some of these, the persons who were favoured with them are unwilling should be mentioned, from a too anxious apprehension, as I think, that they might be suspected of having received larger assistance; and some, after all the diligence I have bestowed, have escaped my enquiries. He told me, a great many years ago, &lsquo;he believed he had dedicated to all the Royal Family round;&rsquo; and it was indifferent to him what was the subject of the work dedicated, provided it were innocent. He once dedicated some Musick for the German Flute to Edward, Duke of York. In writing Dedications for others, he considered himself as by no means speaking his own sentiments.</p>
<p class="p24">Notwithstanding his long silence, I never omitted to write to him when I had any thing worthy of communicating. I generally kept copies of my letters to him, that I might have a full view of our correspondence, and never be at a loss to understand any reference in his letters. He kept the greater part of mine very carefully; and a short time before his death was attentive enough to seal them up in bundles, and order them to be delivered to me, which was accordingly done. Amongst them I found one, of which I had not made a copy, and which I own I read with pleasure at the distance of almost twenty years. It is dated November, 1765, at the palace of Pascal Paoli, in Corte, the capital of Corsica, and is full of generous enthusiasm. After giving a sketch of what I had seen and heard in that island, it proceeded thus: &lsquo;I dare to call this a spirited tour. I dare, to challenge your approbation.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">This letter produced the following answer, which I found on my arrival at Paris.</p>
<p class="p24">A Mr. Mr. BOSWELL, chez Mr. WATERS, Banquier, à Paris.</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Apologies are seldom of any use. We will delay till your arrival the reasons, good or bad, which have made me such a sparing and ungrateful correspondent. Be assured, for the present, that nothing has lessened either the esteem or love with which I dismissed you at Harwich. Both have been increased by all that I have been told of you by yourself or others; and when you return, you will return to an unaltered, and, I hope, unalterable friend.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;All that you have to fear from me is the vexation of disappointing me. No man loves to frustrate expectations which have been formed in his favour; and the pleasure which I promise myself from your journals and remarks is so great, that perhaps no degree of attention or discernment will be sufficient to afford it.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Come home, however, and take your chance. I long to see you, and to hear you; and hope that we shall not be so long separated again. Come home, and expect such a welcome as is due to him whom a wise and noble curiosity has led, where perhaps no native of this country ever was before.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I have no news to tell you that can deserve your notice; nor would I willingly lessen the pleasure that any novelty may give you at your return. I am afraid we shall find it difficult to keep among us a mind which has been so long feasted with variety. But let us try what esteem and kindness can effect.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;As your father&rsquo;s liberality has indulged you with so long a ramble, I doubt not but you will think his sickness, or even his desire to see you, a sufficient reason for hastening your return. The longer we live, and the more we think, the higher value we learn to put on the friendship and tenderness of parents and of friends. Parents we can have but once; and he promises himself too much, who enters life with the expectation of finding many friends. Upon some motive, I hope, that you will be here soon; and am willing to think that it will be an inducement to your return, that it is sincerely desired by, dear Sir,</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;Your affectionate humble servant,<br/>&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;Johnson&rsquo;s Court, Fleet-street,<br/>January 14, 1766.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I returned to London in February, and found Dr. Johnson in a good house in Johnson&rsquo;s Court, Fleet-street, in which he had accommodated Miss Williams with an apartment on the ground floor, while Mr. Levett occupied his post in the garret: his faithful Francis was still attending upon him. He received me with much kindness. The fragments of our first conversation, which I have preserved, are these: I told him that Voltaire, in a conversation with me, had distinguished Pope and Dryden thus:&mdash; &lsquo;Pope drives a handsome chariot, with a couple of neat trim nags; Dryden a coach, and six stately horses.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, the truth is, they both drive coaches and six; but Dryden&rsquo;s horses are either galloping or stumbling: Pope&rsquo;s go at a steady even trot.&rsquo; He said of Goldsmith&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Traveller</span>, which had been published in my absence, &lsquo;There has not been so fine a poem since Pope&rsquo;s time.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">And here it is proper to settle, with authentick precision, what has long floated in publick report, as to Johnson&rsquo;s being himself the authour of a considerable part of that poem. Much, no doubt, both of the sentiments and expression, were derived from conversation with him; and it was certainly submitted to his friendly revision: but in the year 1783, he, at my request, marked with a pencil the lines which he had furnished, which are only line 420th,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To stop too fearful, and too faint to go;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">and the concluding ten lines, except the last couplet but one, which I distinguish by the Italick character:</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;How small of all that human hearts endure,<br/>That part which kings or laws can cause or cure.<br/>Still to ourselves in every place consign&rsquo;d,<br/>Our own felicity we make or find;<br/>With secret course, which no loud storms annoy,<br/>Glides the smooth current of domestick joy:<br/><span class="t8">The lifted axe, the agonizing wheel,<br/>Luke&rsquo;s iron crown, and Damien&rsquo;s bed of steel</span>,<br/>To men remote from power, but rarely known,<br/>Leave reason, faith, and conscience, all our own.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He added, &lsquo;These are all of which I can be sure.&rsquo; They bear a small proportion to the whole, which consists of four hundred and thirty-eight verses. Goldsmith, in the couplet which he inserted, mentions Luke as a person well known, and superficial readers have passed it over quite smoothly; while those of more attention have been as much perplexed by <span class="t8">Luke</span>, as by <span class="t8">Lydiat</span>, in <span class="t8">The Vanity of Human Wishes</span>. The truth is, that Goldsmith himself was in a mistake. In the <span class="t8">Respublica Hungarian</span>, there is an account of a desperate rebellion in the year 1514, headed by two brothers, of the name of <span class="t8">Zeck</span>, George and Luke. When it was quelled, <span class="t8">George</span>, not <span class="t8">Luke</span>, was punished by his head being encircled with a red-hot iron crown: &lsquo;<span class="t8">coronâ candescente ferreâ coronatur</span>.&rsquo; The same severity of torture was exercised on the Earl of Athol, one of the murderers of King James I. of Scotland.</p>
<p class="p24">Dr. Johnson at the same time favoured me by marking the lines which he furnished to Goldsmith&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Deserted Village</span>, which are only the last four:</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;That trade&rsquo;s proud empire hastes to swift decay,<br/>As ocean sweeps the labour&rsquo;d mole away:<br/>While self-dependent power can time defy,<br/>As rocks resist the billows and the sky.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Talking of education, &lsquo;People have now a days, (said he,) got a strange opinion that every thing should be taught by lectures. Now, I cannot see that lectures can do so much good as reading the books from which the lectures are taken. I know nothing that can be best taught by lectures, except where experiments are to be shewn. You may teach chymistry by lectures. &mdash; You might teach making of shoes by lectures!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">At night I supped with him at the Mitre tavern, that we might renew our social intimacy at the original place of meeting. But there was now a considerable difference in his way of living. Having had an illness, in which he was advised to leave off wine, he had, from that period, continued to abstain from it, and drank only water, or lemonade.</p>
<p class="p24">I told him that a foreign friend of his, whom I had met with abroad, was so wretchedly perverted to infidelity, that he treated the hopes of immortality with brutal levity; and said, &lsquo;As man dies like a dog, let him lie like a dog.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;<span class="t8">If</span> he dies like a dog, <span class="t8">let</span> him lie like a dog.&rsquo; I added, that this man said to me, &lsquo;I hate mankind, for I think myself one of the best of them, and I know how bad I am.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, he must be very singular in his opinion, if he thinks himself one of the best of men; for none of his friends think him so.&rsquo; &mdash; He said, &lsquo;no honest man could be a Deist; for no man could be so after a fair examination of the proofs of Christianity.&rsquo; I named Hume. JOHNSON. &lsquo;No, Sir; Hume owned to a clergyman in the bishoprick of Durham, that he had never read the New Testament with attention.&rsquo; I mentioned Hume&rsquo;s notion, that all who are happy are equally happy; a little miss with a new gown at a dancing school ball, a general at the head of a victorious army, and an orator, after having made an eloquent speech in a great assembly. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, that all who are happy, are equally happy, is not true. A peasant and a philosopher may be equally <span class="t8">satisfied</span>, but not equally <span class="t8">happy</span>. Happiness consists in the multiplicity of agreeable consciousness. A peasant has not capacity for having equal happiness with a philosopher.&rsquo; I remember this very question very happily illustrated in opposition to Hume, by the Reverend Mr. Robert Brown, at Utrecht. &lsquo;A small drinking-glass and a large one, (said he,) may be equally full; but the large one holds more than the small.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Dr. Johnson was very kind this evening, and said to me, &lsquo;You have now lived five-and-twenty years, and you have employed them well.&rsquo; &lsquo;Alas, Sir, (said I,) I fear not. Do I know history? Do I know mathematicks? Do I know law?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, though you may know no science so well as to be able to teach it, and no profession so well as to be able to follow it, your general mass of knowledge of books and men renders you very capable to make yourself master of any science, or fit yourself for any profession.&rsquo; I mentioned that a gay friend had advised me against being a lawyer, because I should be excelled by plodding block-heads. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, in the formulary and statutory part of law, a plodding block-head may excel; but in the ingenious and rational part of it a plodding block-head can never excel.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I talked of the mode adopted by some to rise in the world, by courting great men, and asked him whether he had ever submitted to it. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, I never was near enough to great men, to court them. You may be prudently attached to great men and yet independent. You are not to do what you think wrong; and, Sir, you are to calculate, and not pay too dear for what you get. You must not give a shilling&rsquo;s worth of court for six-pence worth of good. But if you can get a shilling&rsquo;s worth of good for six-pence worth of court, you are a fool if you do not pay court.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He said, &lsquo;If convents should be allowed at all, they should only be retreats for persons unable to serve the publick, or who have served it. It is our first duty to serve society, and, after we have done that, we may attend wholly to the salvation of our own souls. A youthful passion for abstracted devotion should not be encouraged.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I introduced the subject of second sight, and other mysterious manifestations; the fulfilment of which, I suggested, might happen by chance. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Yes, Sir; but they have happened so often, that mankind have agreed to think them not fortuitous.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I talked to him a great deal of what I had seen in Corsica, and of my intention to publish an account of it. He encouraged me by saying, &lsquo;You cannot go to the bottom of the subject; but all that you tell us will be new to us. Give us as many anecdotes as you can.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Our next meeting at the Mitre was on Saturday the 15th of February, when I presented to him my old and most intimate friend, the Reverend Mr. Temple, then of Cambridge. I having mentioned that I had passed some time with Rousseau in his wild retreat, and having quoted some remark made by Mr. Wilkes, with whom I had spent many pleasant hours in Italy, Johnson said (sarcastically,) &lsquo;It seems, Sir, you have kept very good company abroad, Rousseau and Wilkes!&rsquo; Thinking it enough to defend one at a time, I said nothing as to my gay friend, but answered with a smile, &lsquo;My dear Sir, you don&rsquo;t call Rousseau bad company. Do you really think him a bad man?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, if you are talking jestingly of this, I don&rsquo;t talk with you. If you mean to be serious, I think him one of the worst of men; a rascal who ought to be hunted out of society, as he has been. Three or four nations have expelled him; and it is a shame that he is protected in this country.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t deny, Sir, but that his novel may, perhaps, do harm; but I cannot think his intention was bad.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, that will not do. We cannot prove any man&rsquo;s intention to be bad. You may shoot a man through the head, and say you intended to miss him; but the Judge will order you to be hanged. An alleged want of intention, when evil is committed, will not be allowed in a court of justice. Rousseau, Sir, is a very bad man. I would sooner sign a sentence for his transportation, than that of any felon who has gone from the Old Bailey these many years. Yes, I should like to have him work in the plantations.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Sir, do you think him as bad a man as Voltaire?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, it is difficult to settle the proportion of iniquity between them.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">This violence seemed very strange to me, who had read many of Rousseau&rsquo;s animated writings with great pleasure, and even edification, had been much pleased with his society, and was just come from the Continent, where he was very generally admired. Nor can I yet allow that he deserves the very severe censure which Johnson pronounced upon him. His absurd preference of savage to civilised life, and other singularities, are proofs rather of a defect in his understanding, than of any depravity in his heart. And notwithstanding the unfavourable opinion which many worthy men have expressed of his &lsquo;<span class="t8">Profession de Foi du Vicaire Savoyard</span>&rsquo;, I cannot help admiring it as the performance of a man full of sincere reverential submission to Divine Mystery, though beset with perplexing doubts; a state of mind to be viewed with pity rather than with anger.</p>
<p class="p24">On his favourite subject of subordination, Johnson said, &lsquo;So far is it from being true that men are naturally equal, that no two people can be half an hour together, but one shall acquire an evident superiority over the other.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I mentioned the advice given us by philosophers, to console ourselves, when distressed or embarrassed, by thinking of those who are in a worse situation than ourselves. This, I observed, could not apply to all, for there must be some who have nobody worse than they are. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, to be sure, Sir, there are; but they don&rsquo;t know it. There is no being so poor and so contemptible, who does not think there is somebody still poorer, and still more contemptible.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">As my stay in London at this time was very short, I had not many opportunities of being with Dr. Johnson; but I felt my veneration for him in no degree lessened, by my having seen <span class="t8">mullorum hominum mores et urbes</span>. On the contrary, by having it in my power to compare him with many of the most celebrated persons of other countries, my admiration of his extraordinary mind was increased and confirmed.</p>
<p class="p24">The roughness, indeed, which sometimes appeared in his manners, was more striking to me now, from my having been accustomed to the studied smooth complying habits of the Continent; and I clearly recognised in him, not without respect for his honest conscientious zeal, the same indignant and sarcastical mode of treating every attempt to unhinge or weaken good principles.</p>
<p class="p24">One evening when a young gentleman teized him with an account of the infidelity of his servant, who, he said, would not believe the scriptures, because he could not read them in the original tongues, and be sure that they were not invented. &lsquo;Why, foolish fellow, (said Johnson,) has he any better authority for almost every thing that he believes?&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Then the vulgar, Sir, never can know they are right, but must submit themselves to the learned.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;To be sure, Sir. The vulgar are the children of the State, and must be taught like children.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Then, Sir, a poor Turk must be a Mahometan, just as a poor Englishman must be a Christian?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, yes, Sir; and what then? This now is such stuff as I used to talk to my mother, when I first began to think myself a clever fellow; and she ought to have whipt me for it.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Another evening Dr. Goldsmith and I called on him, with the hope of prevailing on him to sup with us at the Mitre. We found him indisposed, and resolved not to go abroad. &lsquo;Come then, (said Goldsmith,) we will not go to the Mitre to-night, since we cannot have the big man with us.&rsquo; Johnson then called for a bottle of port, of which Goldsmith and I partook, while our friend, now a water-drinker, sat by us. GOLDSMITH. &lsquo;I think, Mr. Johnson, you don&rsquo;t go near the theatres now. You give yourself no more concern about a new play, than if you had never had any thing to do with the stage.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, our tastes greatly alter. The lad does not care for the child&rsquo;s rattle, and the old man does not care for the young man&rsquo;s whore.&rsquo; GOLDSMITH. &lsquo;Nay, Sir, but your Muse was not a whore.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, I do not think she was. But as we advance in the journey of life, we drop some of the things which have pleased us; whether it be that we are fatigued and don&rsquo;t choose to carry so many things any farther, or that we find other things which we like better.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;But, Sir, why don&rsquo;t you give us something in some other way?&rsquo; GOLDSMITH. &lsquo;Ay, Sir, we have a claim upon you.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;No, Sir, I am not obliged to do any more. No man is obliged to do as much as he can do. A man is to have part of his life to himself. If a soldier has fought a good many campaigns, he is not to be blamed if he retires to ease and tranquillity. A physician, who has practised long in a great city, may be excused if he retires to a small town, and takes less practice. Now, Sir, the good I can do by my conversation bears the same proportion to the good I can do by my writings, that the practice of a physician, retired to a small town, does to his practice in a great city.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;But I wonder, Sir, you have not more pleasure in writing than in not writing.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, you <span class="t8">may</span> wonder.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He talked of making verses, and observed, &lsquo;The great difficulty is to know when you have made good ones. When composing, I have generally had them in my mind, perhaps fifty at a time, walking up and down in my room; and then I have written them down, and often, from laziness, have written only half lines. I have written a hundred lines in a day. I remember I wrote a hundred lines of <span class="t8">The Vanity of Human Wishes</span> in a day. Doctor, (turning to Goldsmith,) I am not quite idle; I have one line t&rsquo;other day; but I made no more.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">GOLDSMITH. &lsquo;Let us hear it; we&rsquo;ll put a bad one to it..</p>
<p class="p24">JOHNSON. &lsquo;No, Sir, I have forgot it.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Such specimens of the easy and playful conversation of the great Dr. Samuel Johnson are, I think, to be prized; as exhibiting the little varieties of a mind so enlarged and so powerful when objects of consequence required its exertions, and as giving us a minute knowledge of his character and modes of thinking.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To BENNET LANGTON, ESQ., AT LANGTON, NEAR SPILSBY, LINCOLNSHIRE.</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;What your friends have done, that from your departure till now nothing has been heard of you, none of us are able to inform the rest; but as we are all neglected alike, no one thinks himself entitled to the privilege of complaint.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I should have known nothing of you or of Langton, from the time that dear Miss Langton left us, had not I met Mr. Simpson, of Lincoln, one day in the street, by whom I was informed that Mr. Langton, your Mamma, and yourself, had been all ill, but that you were all recovered.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;That sickness should suspend your correspondence, I did not wonder; but hoped that it would be renewed at your recovery.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Since you will not inform us where you are, or how you live, I know not whether you desire to know any thing of us. However, I will tell you that THE CLUB subsists; but we have the loss of Burke&rsquo;s company since he has been engaged in publick business, in which he has gained more reputation than perhaps any man at his [first] appearance ever gained before. He made two speeches in the House for repealing the Stamp-act, which were publickly commended by Mr. Pitt, and have filled the town with wonder.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Burke is a great man by nature, and is expected soon to attain civil greatness. I am grown greater too, for I have maintained the newspapers these many weeks; and what is greater still, I have risen every morning since New-year&rsquo;s day, at about eight; when I was up, I have indeed done but little; yet it is no slight advancement to obtain for so many hours more, the consciousness of being.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I wish you were in my new study; I am now writing the first letter in it. I think it looks very pretty about me.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Dyer is constant at THE CLUB; Hawkins is remiss; I am not over diligent. Dr. Nugent, Dr. Goldsmith, and Mr. Reynolds, are very constant. Mr. Lye is printing his Saxon and Gothick Dictionary; all THE CLUB subscribes.</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;You will pay my respects to all my Lincolnshire friends. I am, dear<br/>Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Most affectionately your&rsquo;s,</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;March 9, 1766.<br/>Johnson&rsquo;s-court, Fleet-street.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To BENNET LANGTON, ESQ., AT LANGTON, NEAR SPILSBY, LINCOLNSHIRE.</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;In supposing that I should be more than commonly affected by the death of Peregrine Langton, you were not mistaken; he was one of those whom I loved at once by instinct and by reason. I have seldom indulged more hope of any thing than of being able to improve our acquaintance to friendship. Many a time have I placed myself again at Langton, and imagined the pleasure with which I should walk to Partney in a summer morning; but this is no longer possible. We must now endeavour to preserve what is left us, &mdash; his example of piety and oeconomy. I hope you make what enquiries you can, and write down what is told you. The little things which distinguish domestick characters are soon forgotten: if you delay to enquire, you will have no information; if you neglect to write, information will be vain.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;His art of life certainly deserves to be known and studied. He lived in plenty and elegance upon an income which, to many would appear indigent, and to most, scanty. How he lived, therefore, every man has an interest in knowing. His death, I hope, was peaceful; it was surely happy.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I wish I had written sooner, lest, writing now, I should renew your grief; but I would not forbear saying what I have now said.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;This loss is, I hope, the only misfortune of a family to whom no misfortune at all should happen, if my wishes could avert it. Let me know how you all go on. Has Mr. Langton got him the little horse that I recommended? It would do him good to ride about his estate in fine weather.</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;Be pleased to make my compliments to Mrs. Langton, and to dear Miss<br/>Langton, and Miss Di, and Miss Juliet, and to every body else.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The wonder, with most that hear an account of his oeconomy, will be, how he was able, with such an income, to do so much, especially when it is considered that he paid for everything he had; he had no land, except the two or three small fields which I have said he rented; and, instead of gaining any thing by their produce, I have reason to think he lost by them; however, they furnished him with no further assistance towards his housekeeping, than grass for his horses, (not hay, for that I know he bought,) and for two cows. Every Monday morning he settled his family accounts, and so kept up a constant attention to the confining his expences within his income; and to do it more exactly, compared those expences with a computation he had made, how much that income would afford him every week and day of the year. One of his oeconomical practices was, as soon as any repair was wanting in or about his house, to have it immediately performed. When he had money to spare, he chose to lay in a provision of linen or clothes, or any other necessaries; as then, he said, he could afford it, which he might not be so well able to do when the actual want came; in consequence of which method, he had a considerable supply of necessary articles lying by him, beside what was in use.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;But the main particular that seems to have enabled him to do so much with his income, was, that he paid for every thing as soon as he had it, except, alone, what were current accounts, such as rent for his house and servants&rsquo; wages; and these he paid at the stated times with the utmost exactness. He gave notice to the tradesmen of the neighbouring market-towns that they should no longer have his custom, if they let any of his servants have anything without their paying for it. Thus he put it out of his power to commit those imprudences to which those are liable that defer their payments by using their money some other way than where it ought to go. And whatever money he had by him, he knew that it was not demanded elsewhere, but that he might safely employ it as he pleased.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;His example was confined, by the sequestered place of his abode, to the observation of few, though his prudence and virtue would have made it valuable to all who could have known it. &mdash; These few particulars, which I knew myself, or have obtained from those who lived with him, may afford instruction, and be an incentive to that wise art of living, which he so successfully practised.&rsquo; BOSWELL.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;THE CLUB holds very well together. Monday is my night. I continue to rise tolerably well, and read more than I did. I hope something will yet come on it. I am, Sir,</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;Your most affectionate servant,<br/>&lsquo;SAM JOHNSON&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;May 10, 1766,<br/>Johnson&rsquo;s-court, Fleet-street.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">After I had been some time in Scotland, I mentioned to him in a letter that &lsquo;On my first return to my native country, after some years of absence, I was told of a vast number of my acquaintance who were all gone to the land of forgetfulness, and I found myself like a man stalking over a field of battle, who every moment perceives some one lying dead.&rsquo; I complained of irresolution, and mentioned my having made a vow as a security for good conduct. I wrote to him again, without being able to move his indolence; nor did I hear from him till he had received a copy of my inaugural Exercise, or Thesis in Civil Law, which I published at my admission as an Advocate, as is the custom in Scotland. He then wrote to me as follows:</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To JAMES BOSWELL, ESQ.</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The reception of your Thesis put me in mind of my debt to you Why did you &mdash;&mdash; . I will punish you for it, by telling you that your Latin wants correction. In the beginning, <span class="t8">Spei alterae</span>, not to urge that it should be <span class="t8">prima</span>, is not grammatical: <span class="t8">alterae</span> should be <span class="t8">alteri</span>. In the next line you seem to use <span class="t8">genus</span> absolutely, for what we call <span class="t8">family</span>, that is, for <span class="t8">illustrious extraction</span>, I doubt without authority. <span class="t8">Homines nullius originis</span>, for <span class="t8">Nullis orti majoribus</span>, or, <span class="t8">Nullo loco nati</span>, is, I am afraid, barbarous. &mdash; Ruddiman is dead.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I have now vexed you enough, and will try to please you. Your resolution to obey your father I sincerely approve; but do not accustom yourself to enchain your volatility by vows: they will sometime leave a thorn in your mind, which you will, perhaps, never be able to extract or eject. Take this warning, it is of great importance.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The study of the law is what you very justly term it, copious and generous; and in adding your name to its professors, you have done exactly what I always wished, when I wished you best. I hope that you will continue to pursue it vigorously and constantly. You gain, at least, what is no small advantage, security from those troublesome and wearisome discontents, which are always obtruding themselves upon a mind vacant, unemployed, and undetermined.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;You ought to think it no small inducement to diligence and perseverance, that they will please your father. We all live upon the hope of pleasing somebody; and the pleasure of pleasing ought to be greatest, and at last always will be greatest, when our endeavours are exerted in consequence of our duty.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Life is not long, and too much of it must not pass in idle deliberation how it shall be spent; deliberation, which those who begin it by prudence, and continue it with subtilty, must, after long expence of thought, conclude by chance. To prefer one future mode of life to another, upon just reasons, requires faculties which it has not pleased our Creator to give us.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;If, therefore, the profession you have chosen has some unexpected inconveniencies, console yourself by reflecting that no profession is without them; and that all the importunities and perplexities of business are softness and luxury, compared with the incessant cravings of vacancy, and the unsatisfactory expedients of idleness.</p>
<p class="p24">&ldquo;<span class="t8">Haec sunt quce nostra polui te voce monere; Vade, age</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;As to your <span class="t8">History of Corsica</span>, you have no materials which others have not, or may not have. You have, somehow, or other, warmed your imagination. I wish there were some cure, like the lover&rsquo;s leap, for all heads of which some single idea has obtained an unreasonable and irregular possession. Mind your own affairs, and leave the Corsicans to theirs. I am, dear Sir,</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;Your most humble servant,<br/>&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;<br/>&lsquo;London, Aug. 21, 1766.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To DR. SAMUEL JOHNSON.</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;Auchinleck, Nov. 6, 1766.<br/>&lsquo;MUCH ESTEEMED AND DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I plead not guilty to &mdash;&mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Having thus, I hope, cleared myself of the charge brought against me, I presume you will not be displeased if I escape the punishment which you have decreed for me unheard. If you have discharged the arrows of criticism against an innocent man, you must rejoice to find they have missed him, or have not been pointed so as to wound him.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To talk no longer in allegory, I am, with all deference, going to offer a few observations in defence of my Latin, which you have found fault with.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;You think I should have used <span class="t8">spei primæ</span>, instead of <span class="t8">spei alteræ</span>. <span class="t8">Spes</span> is, indeed, often used to express something on which we have a future dependence, as in Virg. Eclog. i. l. 14,</p>
<p class="p24">&ldquo;…. <span class="t8">modo namque gemellos</span> Spem <span class="t8">gregis ah silice in nudá connixa reliquit</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">and in Georg. iii. l. 473,</p>
<p class="p24">&ldquo;Spemque <span class="t8">gregemque simul</span>,&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">for the lambs and the sheep. Yet it is also used to express any thing on which we have a present dependence, and is well applied to a man of distinguished influence, our support, our refuge, our <span class="t8">præsidium</span>, as Horace calls Mæcenas. So, Æneid xii. l. 57, Queen Amata addresses her son-in-law Turnus:&mdash; &ldquo;Spes <span class="t8">tu nunc una</span>:&rdquo; and he was then no future hope, for she adds,</p>
<p class="p24">&ldquo;… <span class="t8">decus imperiumque Latini Te penes</span>;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">which might have been said of my Lord Bute some years ago. Now I consider the present Earl of Bute to be &lsquo;<span class="t8">Excelsæ familiæ de Bute</span> spes prima;&rsquo; and my Lord Mountstuart, as his eldest son, to be &lsquo;<span class="t8">spes altera</span>.&rsquo; So in Æneid xii. l. 168, after having mentioned Pater Æneas, who was the <span class="t8">present</span> spes, the <span class="t8">reigning</span> spes, as my German friends would say, the <span class="t8">spes prima</span>, the poet adds,</p>
<p class="p24">&ldquo;<span class="t8">Et juxta Ascanius, magnae</span> spes altera <span class="t8">Romæ</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;You think <span class="t8">alteræ</span> ungrammatical, and you tell me it should have been <span class="t8">alteri</span>. You must recollect, that in old times <span class="t8">alter</span> was declined regularly; and when the ancient fragments preserved in the <span class="t8">Juris Civilis Fontes</span> were written, it was certainly declined in the way that I use it. This, I should think, may protect a lawyer who writes <span class="t8">alteræ</span> in a dissertation upon part of his own science. But as I could hardly venture to quote fragments of old law to so classical a man as Mr. Johnson, I have not made an accurate search into these remains, to find examples of what I am able to produce in poetical composition. We find in Plaut. Rudens, act iii. scene 4,</p>
<p class="p24">&ldquo;<span class="t8">Nam Jiuic alters patria qua: sit profecto nescio</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Plautus is, to be sure, an old comick writer: but in the days of Scipio and Lelius, we find, Terent. Heautontim. act ii. scene 3,</p>
<p class="p24">&ldquo;…. hoc ipsa in itinere alteræ Dum narrat, forte audivi.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;You doubt my having authority for using <span class="t8">genus</span> absolutely, for what we call <span class="t8">family</span>, that is, for <span class="t8">illustrious extraction</span>. Now I take <span class="t8">genus</span> in Latin, to have much the same signification with <span class="t8">birth</span> in English; both in their primary meaning expressing simply descent, but both made to stand [Greek: kat exochaen] noble descent. <span class="t8">Genus</span> is thus used in Hor. lib. ii. Sat. v. 1. 8,</p>
<p class="p24">&ldquo;<span class="t8">Et genus et virtus, nisi cum re, vilior alga est</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;And in lib. i. Epist. vi. 1. 37,</p>
<p class="p24">&ldquo;<span class="t8">Et genus et forinam Regina pecunia donat</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;And in the celebrated contest between Ajax and Ulysses, Ovid&rsquo;s<br/>Metamorph. lib. xiii. 1. 140,</p>
<p class="p24">&ldquo;<span class="t8">Nam genus et proavos, et quæ &mdash; non fecimus ipsi Vix ea nostra voco</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;<span class="t8">Homines nullius originis</span>, for <span class="t8">nullis orti majoribus</span>, or <span class="t8">nullo loco nati</span>, is, you are &ldquo;afraid, barbarous.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;<span class="t8">Origo</span> is used to signify extraction, as in Virg. Æneid i. 1. 286,</p>
<p class="p24">&ldquo;<span class="t8">Nascetur pulchrd Trojanus</span> origine <span class="t8">Cæsar</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">And in Æneid x. 1. 618,</p>
<p class="p24">&ldquo;<span class="t8">Ille tamen nostrâ deducit</span> origine <span class="t8">nomen</span>&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p26">And as <span class="t8">nullus</span> is used for obscure, is it not in the genius of the<br/>Latin language to write <span class="t8">nullius originis</span>, for obscure extraction?</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I have defended myself as well as I could.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Might I venture to differ from you with regard to the utility of vows? I am sensible that it would be very dangerous to make vows rashly, and without a due consideration. But I cannot help thinking that they may often be of great advantage to one of a variable judgement and irregular inclinations. I always remember a passage in one of your letters to our Italian friend Baretti; where talking of the monastick life, you say you do not wonder that serious men should put themselves under the protection of a religious order, when they have found how unable they are to take care of themselves. For my own part, without affecting to be a Socrates, I am sure I have a more than ordinary struggle to maintain with <span class="t8">the Evil Principle</span>; and all the methods I can devise are little enough to keep me tolerably steady in the paths of rectitude.</p>
<p class="p10">* * * * *</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;I am ever, with the highest veneration,<br/>&lsquo;Your affectionate humble servant,<br/>&lsquo;JAMES BOSWELL.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">It appears from Johnson&rsquo;s diary, that he was this year at Mr. Thrale&rsquo;s, from before Midsummer till after Michaelmas, and that he afterwards passed a month at Oxford. He had then contracted a great intimacy with Mr. Chambers of that University, afterwards Sir Robert Chambers, one of the Judges in India.</p>
<p class="p24">He published nothing this year in his own name; but the noble dedication[*] to the King, of Gwyn&rsquo;s <span class="t8">London and Westminster Improved</span>, was written by him; and he furnished the Preface,[Dagger] and several of the pieces, which compose a volume of <span class="t8">Miscellanies</span> by Mrs. Anna Williams, the blind lady who had an asylum in his house. Of these, there are his &lsquo;Epitaph on Philips,&rsquo;[*] &lsquo;Translation of a Latin Epitaph on Sir Thomas Hanmer,&rsquo;[Dagger] &lsquo;Friendship, an Ode,&rsquo;[*] and, &lsquo;The Ant,&rsquo;[*] a paraphrase from the Proverbs, of which I have a copy in his own hand-writing; and, from internal evidence, I ascribe to him, &lsquo;To Miss &mdash;&mdash; , on her giving the Authour a gold and silk net-work Purse of her own weaving&rsquo;; [Dagger] and, &lsquo;The happy Life.&rsquo;[Dagger]</p>
<p class="p24">Most of the pieces in this volume have evidently received additions from his superiour pen, particularly &lsquo;Verses to Mr. Richardson, on his Sir Charles Grandison;&rsquo; &lsquo;The Excursion;&rsquo; &lsquo;Reflections on a Grave digging in Westminster Abbey.&rsquo; There is in this collection a poem &lsquo;On the Death of Stephen Grey, the Electrician;&rsquo;[*] which, on reading it, appeared to me to be undoubtedly Johnson&rsquo;s. I asked Mrs. Williams whether it was not his. &lsquo;Sir, (said she, with some warmth,) I wrote that poem before I had the honour of Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s acquaintance.&rsquo; I, however, was so much impressed with my first notion, that I mentioned it to Johnson, repeating, at the same time, what Mrs. Williams had said. His answer was, &lsquo;It is true, Sir, that she wrote it before she was acquainted with me; but she has not told you that I wrote it all over again, except two lines.&rsquo; &lsquo;The Fountains,&rsquo;[dagger] a beautiful little Fairy tale in prose, written with exquisite simplicity, is one of Johnson&rsquo;s productions; and I cannot with-hold from Mrs. Thrale the praise of being the authour of that admirable poem, &lsquo;The Three Warnings.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He wrote this year a letter, not intended for publication, which has, perhaps, as strong marks of his sentiment and style, as any of his compositions. The original is in my possession. It is addressed to the late Mr. William Drummond, bookseller in Edinburgh, a gentleman of good family, but small estate, who took arms for the house of Stuart in 1745; and during his concealment in London till the act of general pardon came out obtained the acquaintance of Dr. Johnson, who justly esteemed him as a very worthy man. It seems, some of the members of the society in Scotland for propagating Christian knowledge, had opposed the scheme of translating the holy scriptures into the Erse or Gaelick language, from political considerations of the disadvantage of keeping up the distinction between the Highlanders and the other inhabitants of North-Britain. Dr. Johnson being informed of this, I suppose by Mr. Drummond, wrote with a generous indignation as follows:</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To MR. WILLIAM DRUMMOND.</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I did not expect to hear that it could be, in an assembly convened for the propagation of Christian knowledge, a question whether any nation uninstructed in religion should receive instruction; or whether that instruction should be imparted to them by a translation of the holy books into their own language. If obedience to the will of God be necessary to happiness, and knowledge of his will be necessary to obedience, I know not how he that with-holds this knowledge, or delays it, can be said to love his neighbour as himself. He that voluntarily continues ignorance, is guilty of all the crimes which ignorance produces; as to him that should extinguish the tapers of a light-house, might justly be imputed the calamities of shipwrecks. Christianity is the highest perfection of humanity; and as no man is good but as he wishes the good of others, no man can be good in the highest degree who wishes not to others the largest measures of the greatest good. To omit for a year, or for a day, the most efficacious method of advancing Christianity, in compliance with any purposes that terminate on this side of the grave, is a crime of which I know not that the world has yet had an example, except in the practice of the planters of America, a race of mortals whom, I suppose, no other man wishes to resemble.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The Papists have, indeed, denied to the laity the use of the bible; but this prohibition, in few places now very rigorously enforced, is defended by arguments, which have for their foundation the care of souls. To obscure, upon motives merely political, the light of revelation, is a practice reserved for the reformed; and, surely, the blackest midnight of popery is meridian sunshine to such a reformation. I am not very willing that any language should be totally extinguished. The similitude and derivation of languages afford the most indubitable proof of the traduction of nations, and the genealogy of mankind. They add often physical certainty to historical evidence; and often supply the only evidence of ancient migrations, and of the revolutions of ages which left no written monuments behind them.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Every man&rsquo;s opinions, at least his desires, are a little influenced by his favourite studies. My zeal for languages may seem, perhaps, rather over-heated, even to those by whom I desire to be well-esteemed. To those who have nothing in their thoughts but trade or policy, present power, or present money, I should not think it necessary to defend my opinions; but with men of letters I would not unwillingly compound, by wishing the continuance of every language, however narrow in its extent, or however incommodious for common purposes, till it is reposited in some version of a known book, that it may be always hereafter examined and compared with other languages, and then permitting its disuse. For this purpose, the translation of the bible is most to be desired. It is not certain that the same method will not preserve the Highland language, for the purposes of learning, and abolish it from daily use. When the Highlanders read the Bible, they will naturally wish to have its obscurities cleared, and to know the history, collateral or appendant. Knowledge always desires increase: it is like fire, which must first be kindled by some external agent, but which will afterwards propagate itself. When they once desire to learn, they will naturally have recourse to the nearest language by which that desire can be gratified; and one will tell another that if he would attain knowledge, he must learn English.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;This speculation may, perhaps, be thought more subtle than the grossness of real life will easily admit. Let it, however, be remembered, that the efficacy of ignorance has been long tried, and has not produced the consequence expected. Let knowledge, therefore, take its turn; and let the patrons of privation stand awhile aside, and admit the operation of positive principles.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;You will be pleased, Sir, to assure the worthy man who is employed in the new translation, that he has my wishes for his success; and if here or at Oxford I can be of any use, that I shall think it more than honour to promote his undertaking.</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;I am sorry that I delayed so long to write.<br/>&lsquo;I am, Sir,<br/>&lsquo;Your most humble servant,<br/>&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;Johnson&rsquo;s-court, Fleet-street,<br/>Aug. 13, 1766.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">The opponents of this pious scheme being made ashamed of their conduct, the benevolent undertaking was allowed to go on.</p>
<p class="p24">The following letters, though not written till the year after, being chiefly upon the same subject, are here inserted.</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">&lsquo;TO MR. WILLIAM DRUMMOND.</span></p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;That my letter should have had such effects as you mention, gives me great pleasure. I hope you do not flatter me by imputing to me more good than I have really done. Those whom my arguments have persuaded to change their opinion, shew such modesty and candour as deserve great praise.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I hope the worthy translator goes diligently forward. He has a higher reward in prospect than any honours which this world can bestow. I wish I could be useful to him.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The publication of my letter, if it could be of use in a cause to which all other causes are nothing, I should not prohibit. But first, I would have you consider whether the publication will really do any good; next, whether by printing and distributing a very small number, you may not attain all that you propose; and, what perhaps I should have said first, whether the letter, which I do not now perfectly remember, be fit to be printed.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;If you can consult Dr. Robertson, to whom I am a little known, I shall be satisfied about the propriety of whatever he shall direct. If he thinks that it should be printed, I entreat him to revise it; there may, perhaps, be some negligent lines written, and whatever is amiss, he knows very well how to rectify.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Be pleased to let me know, from time to time, how this excellent design goes forward.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Make my compliments to young Mr. Drummond, whom I hope you will live to see such as you desire him.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I have not lately seen Mr. Elphinston, but believe him to be prosperous. I shall be glad to hear the same of you, for I am, Sir,</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;Your affectionate humble servant,<br/>&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;Johnson&rsquo;s-court, Fleet-street,<br/>April 21, 1767.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">&lsquo;TO THE SAME.</span></p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I returned this week from the country, after an absence of near six months, and found your letter with many others, which I should have answered sooner, if I had sooner seen them.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Dr. Robertson&rsquo;s opinion was surely right. Men should not be told of the faults which they have mended. I am glad the old language is taught, and honour the translator as a man whom GOD has distinguished by the high office of propagating his word.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I must take the liberty of engaging you in an office of charity. Mrs. Heely, the wife of Mr. Heely, who had lately some office in your theatre, is my near relation, and now in great distress. They wrote me word of their situation some time ago, to which I returned them an answer which raised hopes of more than it is proper for me to give them. Their representation of their affairs I have discovered to be such as cannot be trusted; and at this distance, though their case requires haste, I know not how to act. She, or her daughters, may be heard of at Canongate Head. I must beg, Sir, that you will enquire after them, and let me know what is to be done. I am willing to go to ten pounds, and will transmit you such a sum, if upon examination you find it likely to be of use. If they are in immediate want, advance them what you think proper. What I could do, I would do for the women, having no great reason to pay much regard to Heely himself.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I believe you may receive some intelligence from Mrs. Baker, of the theatre, whose letter I received at the same time with yours; and to whom, if you see her, you will make my excuse for the seeming neglect of answering her.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Whatever you advance within ten pounds shall be immediately returned to you, or paid as you shall order. I trust wholly to your judgement.</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;I am, Sir, &amp;c.<br/>&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;<br/>&lsquo;London, Johnson&rsquo;s-court, Fleet-street,<br/>Oct. 24, 1767.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Mr. Cuthbert Shaw, alike distinguished by his genius, misfortunes, and misconduct, published this year a poem, called <span class="t8">The Race</span>, by &lsquo;Mercurius Spur, Esq.,&rsquo; in which he whimsically made the living poets of England contend for pre-eminence of fame by running:</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Prove by their heels the prowess of the head.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">In this poem there was the following portrait of Johnson:</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;Here Johnson comes, &mdash; unblest with outward grace,<br/>His rigid morals stamp&rsquo;d upon his face.<br/>While strong conceptions struggle in his brain;<br/>(For even wit is brought to bed with pain:)<br/>To view him, porters with their loads would rest,<br/>And babes cling frighted to the nurse&rsquo;s breast.<br/>With looks convuls&rsquo;d he roars in pompous strain,<br/>And, like an angry lion, shakes his mane.<br/>The Nine, with terrour struck, who ne&rsquo;er had seen,<br/>Aught human with so horrible a mien,<br/>Debating whether they should stay or run,<br/>Virtue steps forth, and claims him for her son:<br/>With gentle speech she warns him now to yield,<br/>Nor stain his glories in the doubtful field;<br/>But wrapt in conscious worth, content sit down,<br/>Since Fame, resolv&rsquo;d his various pleas to crown,<br/>Though forc&rsquo;d his present claim to disavow,<br/>Had long reserv&rsquo;d a chaplet for his brow.<br/>He bows, obeys; for time shall first expire,<br/>Ere Johnson stay, when Virtue bids retire.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">The Honourable Thomas Hervey and his lady having unhappily disagreed, and being about to separate, Johnson interfered as their friend, and wrote him a letter of expostulation, which I have not been able to find; but the substance of it is ascertained by a letter to Johnson in answer to it, which Mr. Hervey printed. The occasion of this correspondence between Dr. Johnson and Mr. Hervey, was thus related to me by Mr. Beauclerk. &lsquo;Tom Hervey had a great liking for Johnson, and in his will had left him a legacy of fifty pounds. One day he said to me, &ldquo;Johnson may want this money now, more than afterwards. I have a mind to give it him directly. Will you be so good as to carry a fifty pound note from me to him?&rdquo; This I positively refused to do, as he might, perhaps, have knocked me down for insulting him, and have afterwards put the note in his pocket. But I said, if Hervey would write him a letter, and enclose a fifty pound note, I should take care to deliver it. He accordingly did write him a letter, mentioning that he was only paying a legacy a little sooner. To his letter he added, &ldquo;<span class="t8">P.S. I am going to part with my wife</span>.&rdquo; Johnson then wrote to him, saying nothing of the note, but remonstrating with him against parting with his wife.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">When I mentioned to Johnson this story, in as delicate terms as I could, he told me that the fifty pound note was given to him by Mr. Hervey in consideration of his having written for him a pamphlet against Sir Charles Hanbury Williams, who, Mr. Hervey imagined, was the authour of an attack upon him; but that it was afterwards discovered to be the work of a garreteer who wrote <span class="t8">The Fool</span>: the pamphlet therefore against Sir Charles was not printed.</p>
<p class="p24">In February, 1767, there happened one of the most remarkable incidents of Johnson&rsquo;s life, which gratified his monarchical enthusiasm, and which he loved to relate with all its circumstances, when requested by his friends. This was his being honoured by a private conversation with his Majesty, in the library at the Queen&rsquo;s house. He had frequently visited those splendid rooms and noble collection of books, which he used to say was more numerous and curious than he supposed any person could have made in the time which the King had employed. Mr. Barnard, the librarian, took care that he should have every accommodation that could contribute to his ease and convenience, while indulging his literary taste in that place; so that he had here a very agreeable resource at leisure hours.</p>
<p class="p24">His Majesty having been informed of his occasional visits, was pleased to signify a desire that he should be told when Dr. Johnson came next to the library. Accordingly, the next time that Johnson did come, as soon as he was fairly engaged with a book, on which, while he sat by the fire, he seemed quite intent, Mr. Barnard stole round to the apartment where the King was, and, in obedience to his Majesty&rsquo;s commands, mentioned that Dr. Johnson was then in the library. His Majesty said he was at leisure, and would go to him; upon which Mr. Barnard took one of the candles that stood on the King&rsquo;s table, and lighted his Majesty through a suite of rooms, till they came to a private door into the library, of which his Majesty had the key. Being entered, Mr. Barnard stepped forward hastily to Dr. Johnson, who was still in a profound study, and whispered him, &lsquo;Sir, here is the King.&rsquo; Johnson started up, and stood still. His Majesty approached him, and at once was courteously easy.</p>
<p class="p24">His Majesty began by observing, that he understood he came sometimes to the library; and then mentioning his having heard that the Doctor had been lately at Oxford, asked him if he was not fond of going thither. To which Johnson answered, that he was indeed fond of going to Oxford sometimes, but was likewise glad to come back again. The King then asked him what they were doing at Oxford. Johnson answered, he could not much commend their diligence, but that in some respects they were mended, for they had put their press under better regulations, and were at that time printing Polybius. He was then asked whether there were better libraries at Oxford or Cambridge. He answered, he believed the Bodleian was larger than any they had at Cambridge; at the same time adding, &lsquo;I hope, whether we have more books or not than they have at Cambridge, we shall make as good use of them as they do.&rsquo; Being asked whether All-Souls or Christ-Church library was the largest, he answered, &lsquo;All-Souls library is the largest we have, except the Bodleian.&rsquo; &lsquo;Aye, (said the King,) that is the publick library.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">His Majesty enquired if he was then writing any thing. He answered, he was not, for he had pretty well told the world what he knew, and must now read to acquire more knowledge. The King, as it should seem with a view to urge him to rely on his own stores as an original writer, and to continue his labours, then said &lsquo;I do not think you borrow much from any body.&rsquo; Johnson said, he thought he had already done his part as a writer. &lsquo;I should have thought so too, (said the King,) if you had not written so well.&rsquo; &mdash; Johnson observed to me, upon this, that &lsquo;No man could have paid a handsomer compliment; and it was fit for a King to pay. It was decisive.&rsquo; When asked by another friend, at Sir Joshua Reynolds&rsquo;s, whether he made any reply to this high compliment, he answered, &lsquo;No, Sir. When the King had said it, it was to be so. It was not for me to bandy civilities with my Sovereign.&rsquo; Perhaps no man who had spent his whole life in courts could have shewn a more nice and dignified sense of true politeness, than Johnson did in this instance.</p>
<p class="p24">His Majesty having observed to him that he supposed he must have read a great deal; Johnson answered, that he thought more than he read; that he had read a great deal in the early part of his life, but having fallen into ill health, he had not been able to read much, compared with others: for instance, he said he had not read much, compared with Dr. Warburton. Upon which the King said, that he heard Dr. Warburton was a man of such general knowledge, that you could scarce talk with him on any subject on which he was not qualified to speak; and that his learning resembled Garrick&rsquo;s acting, in its universality. His Majesty then talked of the controversy between Warburton and Lowth, which he seemed to have read, and asked Johnson what he thought of it. Johnson answered, &lsquo;Warburton has most general, most scholastick learning; Lowth is the more correct scholar. I do not know which of them calls names best.&rsquo; The King was pleased to say he was of the same opinion; adding, &lsquo;You do not think, then, Dr. Johnson, that there was much argument in the case.&rsquo; Johnson said, he did not think there was. &lsquo;Why truly, (said the King,) when once it comes to calling names, argument is pretty well at an end.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">His Majesty then asked him what he thought of Lord Lyttelton&rsquo;s <span class="t8">History</span>, which was then just published. Johnson said, he thought his style pretty good, but that he had blamed Henry the Second rather too much. &lsquo;Why, (said the King), they seldom do these things by halves.&rsquo; &lsquo;No, Sir, (answered Johnson), not to Kings.&rsquo; But fearing to be misunderstood, he proceeded to explain himself; and immediately subjoined, &lsquo;That for those who spoke worse of Kings than they deserved, he could find no excuse; but that he could more easily conceive how some might speak better of them than they deserved, without any ill intention; for, as Kings had much in their power to give, those who were favoured by them would frequently, from gratitude, exaggerate their praises; and as this proceeded from a good motive, it was certainly excusable, as far as errour could be excusable.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">The King then asked him what he thought of Dr. Hill. Johnson answered, that he was an ingenious man, but had no veracity; and immediately mentioned, as an instance of it, an assertion of that writer, that he had seen objects magnified to a much greater degree by using three or four microscopes at a time, than by using one. &lsquo;Now, (added Johnson,) every one acquainted with microscopes knows, that the more of them he looks through, the less the object will appear.&rsquo; &lsquo;Why, (replied the King,) this is not only telling an untruth, but telling it clumsily; for, if that be the case, every one who can look through a microscope will be able to detect him.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I now, (said Johnson to his friends, when relating what had passed) began to consider that I was depreciating this man in the estimation of his Sovereign, and thought it was time for me to say something that might be more favourable.&rsquo; He added, therefore, that Dr. Hill was, notwithstanding, a very curious observer; and if he would have been contented to tell the world no more than he knew, he might have been a very considerable man, and needed not to have recourse to such mean expedients to raise his reputation.</p>
<p class="p24">The King then talked of literary journals, mentioned particularly the <span class="t8">Journal des Savans</span>, and asked Johnson if it was well done. Johnson said, it was formerly very well done, and gave some account of the persons who began it, and carried it on for some years; enlarging, at the same time, on the nature and use of such works. The King asked him if it was well done now. Johnson answered, he had no reason to think that it was. The King then asked him if there were any other literary journals published in this kingdom, except the <span class="t8">Monthly</span> and <span class="t8">Critical Reviews</span>; and on being answered there were no other, his Majesty asked which of them was the best: Johnson answered, that the <span class="t8">Monthly Review</span> was done with most care, the <span class="t8">Critical</span> upon the best principles; adding that the authours of the <span class="t8">Monthly Review</span> were enemies to the Church. This the King said he was sorry to hear.</p>
<p class="p24">The conversation next turned on the Philosophical Transactions, when Johnson observed, that they had now a better method of arranging their materials than formerly. &lsquo;Aye, (said the King,) they are obliged to Dr. Johnson for that;&rsquo; for his Majesty had heard and remembered the circumstance, which Johnson himself had forgot.</p>
<p class="p24">His Majesty expressed a desire to have the literary biography of this country ably executed, and proposed to Dr. Johnson to undertake it. Johnson signified his readiness to comply with his Majesty&rsquo;s wishes.</p>
<p class="p24">During the whole of this interview, Johnson talked to his Majesty with profound respect, but still in his firm manly manner, with a sonorous voice, and never in that subdued tone which is commonly used at the levee and in the drawing-room. After the King withdrew, Johnson shewed himself highly pleased with his Majesty&rsquo;s conversation, and gracious behaviour. He said to Mr. Barnard, &lsquo;Sir, they may talk of the King as they will; but he is the finest gentleman I have ever seen.&rsquo; And he afterwards observed to Mr. Langton, &lsquo;Sir, his manners are those of as fine a gentleman as we may suppose Lewis the Fourteenth or Charles the Second.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">At Sir Joshua Reynolds&rsquo;s, where a circle of Johnson&rsquo;s friends was collected round him to hear his account of this memorable conversation, Dr. Joseph Warton, in his frank and lively manner, was very active in pressing him to mention the particulars. &lsquo;Come now, Sir, this is an interesting matter; do favour us with it.&rsquo; Johnson, with great good humour, complied.</p>
<p class="p24">He told them, &lsquo;I found his Majesty wished I should talk, and I made it my business to talk. I find it does a man good to be talked to by his Sovereign. In the first place, a man cannot be in a passion &mdash; .&rsquo; Here some question interrupted him, which is to be regretted, as he certainly would have pointed out and illustrated many circumstances of advantage, from being in a situation, where the powers of the mind are at once excited to vigorous exertion, and tempered by reverential awe.</p>
<p class="p24">During all the time in which Dr. Johnson was employed in relating to the circle at Sir Joshua Reynolds&rsquo;s the particulars of what passed between the King and him, Dr. Goldsmith remained unmoved upon a sopha at some distance, affecting not to join in the least in the eager curiosity of the company. He assigned as a reason for his gloom and seeming inattention, that he apprehended Johnson had relinquished his purpose of furnishing him with a Prologue to his play, with the hopes of which he had been flattered; but it was strongly suspected that he was fretting with chagrin and envy at the singular honour Dr. Johnson had lately enjoyed. At length, the frankness and simplicity of his natural character prevailed. He sprung from the sopha, advanced to Johnson, and in a kind of flutter, from imagining himself in the situation which he had just been hearing described, exclaimed, &lsquo;Well, you acquitted yourself in this conversation better than I should have done; for I should have bowed and stammered through the whole of it.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I received no letter from Johnson this year; nor have I discovered any of the correspondence he had, except the two letters to Mr. Drummond, which have been inserted, for the sake of connection with that to the same gentleman in 1766. His diary affords no light as to his employment at this time. He passed three months at Lichfield; and I cannot omit an affecting and solemn scene there, as related by himself:</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Sunday, Oct. 18, 1767. Yesterday, Oct. 17, at about ten in the morning, I took my leave for ever of my dear old friend, Catharine Chambers, who came to live with my mother about 1724, and has been but little parted from us since. She buried my father, my brother, and my mother. She is now fifty-eight years old.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I desired all to withdraw, then told her that we were to part for ever; that as Christians, we should part with prayer; and that I would, if she was willing, say a short prayer beside her. She expressed great desire to hear me; and held up her poor hands, as she lay in bed, with great fervour, while I prayed, kneeling by her, nearly in the following words:</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Almighty and most merciful Father, whose loving kindness is over all thy works, behold, visit, and relieve this thy servant, who is grieved with sickness. Grant that the sense of her weakness may add strength to her faith, and seriousness to her repentance. And grant that by the help of thy Holy Spirit, after the pains and labours of this short life, we may all obtain everlasting happiness, through JESUS CHRIST our Lord; for whose sake hear our prayers. Amen. Our Father, &amp;c.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I then kissed her. She told me, that to part was the greatest pain that she had ever felt, and that she hoped we should meet again in a better place. I expressed, with swelled eyes, and great emotion of tenderness, the same hopes. We kissed, and parted. I humbly hope to meet again, and to part no more.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">By those who have been taught to look upon Johnson as a man of a harsh and stern character, let this tender and affectionate scene be candidly read; and let them then judge whether more warmth of heart, and grateful kindness, is often found in human nature.</p>
<p class="p24">We have the following notice in his devotional record:</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;August 2, 1767. I have been disturbed and unsettled for a long time, and have been without resolution to apply to study or to business, being hindered by sudden snatches.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He, however, furnished Mr. Adams with a Dedication[*] to the King of that ingenious gentleman&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Treatise on the Globes</span>, conceived and expressed in such a manner as could not fail to be very grateful to a Monarch, distinguished for his love of the sciences.</p>
<p class="p24">This year was published a ridicule of his style, under the title of <span class="t8">Lexiphanes</span>. Sir John Hawkins ascribes it to Dr. Kenrick; but its authour was one Campbell, a Scotch purser in the navy. The ridicule consisted in applying Johnson&rsquo;s &lsquo;words of large meaning&rsquo; to insignificant matters, as if one should put the armour of Goliath upon a dwarf. The contrast might be laughable; but the dignity of the armour must remain the same in all considerate minds. This malicious drollery, therefore, it may easily be supposed, could do no harm to its illustrious object.</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;To BENNET LANGTON, ESQ., AT MR. ROTHWELL&rsquo;S, PERFUMER, IN NEW<br/>BOND-STREET, LONDON.</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;That you have been all summer in London, is one more reason for which I regret my long stay in the country. I hope that you will not leave the town before my return. We have here only the chance of vacancies in the passing carriages, and I have bespoken one that may, if it happens, bring me to town on the fourteenth of this month; but this is not certain.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;It will be a favour if you communicate this to Mrs. Williams: I long to see all my friends.</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;I am, dear Sir,<br/>&lsquo;Your most humble servant,<br/>&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Lichfield, Oct. 10, 1767.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">1768: AETAT. 59. &mdash; It appears from his notes of the state of his mind, that he suffered great perturbation and distraction in 1768. Nothing of his writing was given to the publick this year, except the Prologue[*] to his friend Goldsmith&rsquo;s comedy of <span class="t8">The Good-natured Man</span>. The first lines of this Prologue are strongly characteristical of the dismal gloom of his mind; which in his case, as in the case of all who are distressed with the same malady of imagination, transfers to others its own feelings. Who could suppose it was to introduce a comedy, when Mr. Bensley solemnly began,</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;Press&rsquo;d with the load of life, the weary mind<br/>&nbsp;Surveys the general toil of human kind.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">But this dark ground might make Goldsmith&rsquo;s humour shine the more.</p>
<p class="p24">In the spring of this year, having published my <span class="t8">Account of Corsica</span>, with the <span class="t8">Journal of a Tour to that Island</span>, I returned to London , very desirous to see Dr. Johnson, and hear him upon the subject. I found he was at Oxford, with his friend Mr. Chambers, who was now Vinerian Professor, and lived in New Inn Hall. Having had no letter from him since that in which he criticised the Latinity of my Thesis, and having been told by somebody that he was offended at my having put into my Book an extract of his letter to me at Paris, I was impatient to be with him, and therefore followed him to Oxford, where I was entertained by Mr. Chambers, with a civility which I shall ever gratefully remember. I found that Dr. Johnson had sent a letter to me to Scotland, and that I had nothing to complain of but his being more indifferent to my anxiety than I wished him to be. Instead of giving, with the circumstances of time and place, such fragments of his conversation as I preserved during this visit to Oxford, I shall throw them together in continuation.</p>
<p class="p24">I asked him whether, as a moralist, he did not think that the practice of the law, in some degree, hurt the nice feeling of honesty. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why no, Sir, if you act properly. You are not to deceive your clients with false representations of your opinion: you are not to tell lies to a judge.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;But what do you think of supporting a cause which you know to be bad?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, you do not know it to be good or bad till the Judge determines it. I have said that you are to state facts fairly; so that your thinking, or what you call knowing, a cause to be bad, must be from reasoning, must be from your supposing your arguments to be weak and inconclusive. But, Sir, that is not enough. An argument which does not convince yourself, may convince the Judge to whom you urge it: and if it does convince him, why, then, Sir, you are wrong, and he is right. It is his business to judge; and you are not to be confident in your own opinion that a cause is bad, but to say all you can for your client, and then hear the Judge&rsquo;s opinion.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;But, Sir, does not affecting a warmth when you have no warmth, and appearing to be clearly of one opinion when you are in reality of another opinion, does not such dissimulation impair one&rsquo;s honesty? Is there not some danger that a lawyer may put on the same mask in common life, in the intercourse with his friends?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why no, Sir. Everybody knows you are paid for affecting warmth for your client; and it is, therefore, properly no dissimulation: the moment you come from the bar you resume your usual behaviour. Sir, a man will no more carry the artifice of the bar into the common intercourse of society, than a man who is paid for tumbling upon his hands will continue to tumble upon his hands when he should walk on his feet.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Talking of some of the modern plays, he said <span class="t8">False Delicacy</span> was totally void of character. He praised Goldsmith&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Good-natured Man</span>; said, it was the best comedy that had appeared since <span class="t8">The Provoked Husband</span>, and that there had not been of late any such character exhibited on the stage as that of Croaker. I observed it was the Suspirius of his Rambler. He said, Goldsmith had owned he had borrowed it from thence. &lsquo;Sir, (continued he,) there is all the difference in the world between characters of nature and characters of manners; and <span class="t8">there</span> is the difference between the characters of Fielding and those of Richardson. Characters of manners are very entertaining; but they are to be understood, by a more superficial observer, than characters of nature, where a man must dive into the recesses of the human heart.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">It always appeared to me that he estimated the compositions of Richardson too highly, and that he had an unreasonable prejudice against Fielding. In comparing those two writers, he used this expression: &lsquo;that there was as great a difference between them as between a man who knew how a watch was made, and a man who could tell the hour by looking on the dial-plate.&rsquo; This was a short and figurative state of his distinction between drawing characters of nature and characters only of manners. But I cannot help being of opinion, that the neat watches of Fielding are as well constructed as the large clocks of Richardson, and that his dial-plates are brighter. Fielding&rsquo;s characters, though they do not expand themselves so widely in dissertation, are as just pictures of human nature, and I will venture to say, have more striking features, and nicer touches of the pencil; and though Johnson used to quote with approbation a saying of Richardson&rsquo;s, &lsquo;that the virtues of Fielding&rsquo;s heroes were the vices of a truly good man,&rsquo; I will venture to add, that the moral tendency of Fielding&rsquo;s writings, though it does not encourage a strained and rarely possible virtue, is ever favourable to honour and honesty, and cherishes the benevolent and generous affections. He who is as good as Fielding would make him, is an amiable member of society, and may be led on by more regulated instructors, to a higher state of ethical perfection.</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson proceeded: &lsquo;Even Sir Francis Wronghead is a character of manners, though drawn with great humour.&rsquo; He then repeated, very happily, all Sir Francis&rsquo;s credulous account to Manly of his being with &lsquo;the great man,&rsquo; and securing a place. I asked him, if <span class="t8">The Suspicious Husband</span> did not furnish a well-drawn character, that of Ranger. JOHNSON. &lsquo;No, Sir; Ranger is just a rake, a mere rake, and a lively young fellow, but no <span class="t8">character</span>&rsquo;.</p>
<p class="p24">The great Douglas Cause was at this time a very general subject of discussion. I found he had not studied it with much attention, but had only heard parts of it occasionally. He, however, talked of it, and said, &lsquo;I am of opinion that positive proof of fraud should not be required of the plaintiff, but that the Judges should decide according as probability shall appear to preponderate, granting to the defendant the presumption of filiation to be strong in his favour. And I think too, that a good deal of weight should be allowed to the dying declarations, because they were spontaneous. There is a great difference between what is said without our being urged to it, and what is said from a kind of compulsion. If I praise a man&rsquo;s book without being asked my opinion of it, that is honest praise, to which one may trust. But if an authour asks me if I like his book, and I give him something like praise, it must not be taken as my real opinion.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I have not been troubled for a long time with authours desiring my opinion of their works. I used once to be sadly plagued with a man who wrote verses, but who literally had no other notion of a verse, but that it consisted of ten syllables. <span class="t8">Lay your knife and your fork, across your plate</span>, was to him a verse:</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Lay your knife and your fork, across your plate.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;As he wrote a great number of verses, he sometimes by chance made good ones, though he did not know it.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He renewed his promise of coming to Scotland, and going with me to the Hebrides, but said he would now content himself with seeing one or two of the most curious of them. He said, &lsquo;Macaulay, who writes the account of St. Kilda, set out with a prejudice against prejudices, and wanted to be a smart modern thinker; and yet he affirms for a truth, that when a ship arrives there, all the inhabitants are seized with a cold.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Dr. John Campbell, the celebrated writer, took a great deal of pains to ascertain this fact, and attempted to account for it on physical principles, from the effect of effluvia from human bodies. Johnson, at another time, praised Macaulay for his &lsquo;<span class="t8">magnanimity</span>&rsquo; in asserting this wonderful story, because it was well attested. A Lady of Norfolk, by a letter to my friend Dr. Burney, has favoured me with the following solution: &lsquo;Now for the explication of this seeming mystery, which is so very obvious as, for that reason, to have escaped the penetration of Dr. Johnson and his friend, as well as that of the authour. Reading the book with my ingenious friend, the late Reverend Mr. Christian, of Docking &mdash; after ruminating a little, &ldquo;The cause, (says he,) is a natural one. The situation of St. Kilda renders a North-East Wind indispensably necessary before a stranger can land. The wind, not the stranger, occasions an epidemic cold.&rdquo; If I am not mistaken, Mr. Macaulay is dead; if living, this solution might please him, as I hope it will Mr. Boswell, in return for the many agreeable hours his works have afforded us.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson expatiated on the advantages of Oxford for learning. &lsquo;There is here, Sir, (said he,) such a progressive emulation. The students are anxious to appear well to their tutors; the tutors are anxious to have their pupils appear well in the college; the colleges are anxious to have their students appear well in the University; and there are excellent rules of discipline in every college. That the rules are sometimes ill observed, may be true; but is nothing against the system. The members of an University may, for a season, be unmindful of their duty. I am arguing for the excellency of the institution.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Of Guthrie, he said, &lsquo;Sir, he is a man of parts. He has no great regular fund of knowledge; but by reading so long, and writing so long, he no doubt has picked up a good deal.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He said he had lately been a long while at Lichfield, but had grown very weary before he left it. BOSWELL. &lsquo;I wonder at that, Sir; it is your native place.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, so is Scotland <span class="t8">your</span> native place.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">His prejudice against Scotland appeared remarkably strong at this time. When I talked of our advancement in literature, &lsquo;Sir, (said he,) you have learnt a little from us, and you think yourselves very great men. Hume would never have written History, had not Voltaire written it before him. He is an echo of Voltaire.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;But, Sir, we have Lord Kames.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">JOHNSON. &lsquo;You <span class="t8">have</span> Lord Kames. Keep him; ha, ha, ha! We don&rsquo;t envy you him. Do you ever see Dr. Robertson?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">BOSWELL. &lsquo;Yes, Sir.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Does the dog talk of me?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">BOSWELL. &lsquo;Indeed, Sir, he does, and loves you.&rsquo; Thinking that I now had him in a corner, and being solicitous for the literary fame of my country, I pressed him for his opinion on the merit of Dr. Robertson&rsquo;s <span class="t8">History of Scotland</span>. But, to my surprize, he escaped.&mdash; &lsquo;Sir, I love Robertson, and I won&rsquo;t talk of his book.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">It is but justice both to him and Dr. Robertson to add, that though he indulged himself in this sally of wit, he had too good taste not to be fully sensible of the merits of that admirable work.</p>
<p class="p24">An essay, written by Mr. Deane, a divine of the Church of England, maintaining the future life of brutes, by an explication of certain parts of the scriptures, was mentioned, and the doctrine insisted on by a gentleman who seemed fond of curious speculation. Johnson, who did not like to hear of any thing concerning a future state which was not authorised by the regular canons of orthodoxy, discouraged this talk; and being offended at its continuation, he watched an opportunity to give the gentleman a blow of reprehension. So, when the poor speculatist, with a serious metaphysical pensive face, addressed him, &lsquo;But really, Sir, when we see a very sensible dog, we don&rsquo;t know what to think of him;&rsquo; Johnson, rolling with joy at the thought which beamed in his eye, turned quickly round, and replied, &lsquo;True, Sir: and when we see a very foolish <span class="t8">fellow</span>, we don&rsquo;t know what to think of <span class="t8">him</span>.&rsquo; He then rose up, strided to the fire, and stood for some time laughing and exulting.</p>
<p class="p24">I told him that I had several times, when in Italy, seen the experiment of placing a scorpion within a circle of burning coals; that it ran round and round in extreme pain; and finding no way to escape, retired to the centre, and like a true Stoick philosopher, darted its sting into its head, and thus at once freed itself from its woes. &lsquo;This must end &lsquo;em.&rsquo; I said, this was a curious fact, as it shewed deliberate suicide in a reptile. Johnson would not admit the fact. He said, Maupertuis was of opinion that it does not kill itself, but dies of the heat; that it gets to the centre of the circle, as the coolest place; that its turning its tail in upon its head is merely a convulsion, and that it does not sting itself. He said he would be satisfied if the great anatomist Morgagni, after dissecting a scorpion on which the experiment had been tried, should certify that its sting had penetrated into its head.</p>
<p class="p24">He seemed pleased to talk of natural philosophy. &lsquo;That woodcocks, (said he,) fly over to the northern countries is proved, because they have been observed at sea. Swallows certainly sleep all the winter. A number of them conglobulate together, by flying round and round, and then all in a heap throw themselves under water, and lye in the bed of a river.&rsquo; He told us, one of his first essays was a Latin poem upon the glow-worm. I am sorry I did not ask where it was to be found.</p>
<p class="p24">Talking of the Russians and the Chinese, he advised me to read Bell&rsquo;s travels. I asked him whether I should read Du Halde&rsquo;s account of China. &lsquo;Why yes, (said he) as one reads such a book; that is to say, consult it.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He talked of the heinousness of the crime of adultery, by which the peace of families was destroyed. He said, &lsquo;Confusion of progeny constitutes the essence of the crime; and therefore a woman who breaks her marriage vows is much more criminal than a man who does it. A man, to be sure, is criminal in the sight of God: but he does not do his wife a very material injury, if he does not insult her; if, for instance, from mere wantonness of appetite, he steals privately to her chambermaid. Sir, a wife ought not greatly to resent this. I would not receive home a daughter who had run away from her husband on that account. A wife should study to reclaim her husband by more attention to please him. Sir, a man will not, once in a hundred instances, leave his wife and go to a harlot, if his wife has not been negligent of pleasing.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Here he discovered that acute discrimination, that solid judgement, and that knowledge of human nature, for which he was upon all occasions remarkable. Taking care to keep in view then moral and religious duty, as understood in our nation, he shewed clearly from reason and good sense, the greater degree of culpability in the one sex deviating from it than the other; and, at the same time, inculcated a very useful lesson as to <span class="t8">the way to keep him</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">I asked him if it was not hard that one deviation from chastity should so absolutely ruin a young woman. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, no, Sir; it is the great principle which she is taught. When she has given up that principle, she has given up every notion of female honour and virtue, which are all included in chastity.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">A gentleman talked to him of a lady whom he greatly admired and wished to marry, but was afraid of her superiority of talents. &lsquo;Sir, (said he) you need not be afraid; marry her. Before a year goes about, you&rsquo;ll find that reason much weaker, and that wit not so bright.&rsquo; Yet the gentleman may be justified in his apprehension by one of Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s admirable sentences in his life of Waller: &lsquo;He doubtless praised many whom he would have been afraid to marry; and, perhaps, married one whom he would have been ashamed to praise. Many qualities contribute to domestic happiness, upon which poetry has no colours to bestow; and many airs and sallies may delight imagination, which he who flatters them never can approve.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He praised Signor Baretti. &lsquo;His account of Italy is a very entertaining book; and, Sir, I know no man who carries his head higher in conversation than Baretti. There are strong powers in his mind. He has not, indeed, many hooks; but with what hooks he has, he grapples very forcibly.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">At this time I observed upon the dial-plate of his watch a short Greek inscription, taken from the New Testament, <span class="t8">Nux gar erchetai</span>, being the first words of our SAVIOUR&rsquo;S solemn admonition to the improvement of that time which is allowed us to prepare for eternity: &lsquo;the night cometh, when no man can work.&rsquo; He sometime afterwards laid aside this dial-plate; and when I asked him the reason, he said, &lsquo;It might do very well upon a clock which a man keeps in his closet; but to have it upon his watch which he carries about with him, and which is often looked at by others, might be censured as ostentatious.&rsquo; Mr. Steevens is now possessed of the dial-plate inscribed as above.</p>
<p class="p26">He remained at Oxford a considerable time; I was obliged to go to<br/>London, where I received his letter, which had been returned from<br/>Scotland.</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">&lsquo;TO JAMES BOSWELL, ESQ.</span></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">&lsquo;MY DEAR BOSWELL,</span></p>
<p class="p21">&lsquo;I have omitted a long time to write to you, without knowing very well why. I could now tell why I should not write; for who would write to men who publish the letters of their friends, without their leave? Yet I write to you in spite of my caution, to tell you that I shall be glad to see you, and that I wish you would empty your head of Corsica, which I think has filled it rather too long. But, at all events, I shall be glad, very glad to see you.</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;I am, Sir,<br/>&lsquo;Yours affectionately,<br/>&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;<br/>&lsquo;Oxford, March 23, 1768.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I answered thus:</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">&lsquo;TO MR. SAMUEL JOHNSON.</span></p>
<p class="p21">&lsquo;London, 26th April, 1768.</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">&lsquo;MY DEAR SIR,</span></p>
<p class="p21">&lsquo;I have received your last letter, which, though very short, and by no means complimentary, yet gave me real pleasure, because it contains these words, &ldquo;I shall be glad, very glad to see you.&rdquo; Surely you have no reason to complain of my publishing a single paragraph of one of your letters; the temptation to it was so strong. An irrevocable grant of your friendship, and your dignifying my desire of visiting Corsica with the epithet of &ldquo;a wise and noble curiosity,&rdquo; are to me more valuable than many of the grants of kings.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;But how can you bid me &ldquo;empty my head of Corsica?&rdquo; My noble-minded friend, do you not feel for an oppressed nation bravely struggling to be free? Consider fairly what is the case. The Corsicans never received any kindness from the Genoese. They never agreed to be subject to them. They owe them nothing; and when reduced to an abject state of slavery, by force, shall they not rise in the great cause of liberty, and break the galling yoke? And shall not every liberal soul be warm for them? Empty my head of Corsica! Empty it of honour, empty it of humanity, empty it of friendship, empty it of piety. No! while I live, Corsica and the cause of the brave islanders shall ever employ much of my attention, shall ever interest me in the sincerest manner.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am, &amp;c.</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;JAMES BOSWELL.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Upon his arrival in London in May, he surprized me one morning with a visit at my lodgings in Half-Moon-street, was quite satisfied with my explanation, and was in the kindest and most agreeable frame of mind. As he had objected to a part of one of his letters being published, I thought it right to take this opportunity of asking him explicitly whether it would be improper to publish his letters after his death. His answer was, &lsquo;Nay, Sir, when I am dead, you may do as you will.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He talked in his usual style with a rough contempt of popular liberty. &lsquo;They make a rout about <span class="t8">universal</span> liberty, without considering that all that is to be valued, or indeed can be enjoyed by individuals, is <span class="t8">private</span> liberty. Political liberty is good only so far as it produces private liberty. Now, Sir, there is the liberty of the press, which you know is a constant topick. Suppose you and I and two hundred more were restrained from printing our thoughts: what then? What proportion would that restraint upon us bear to the private happiness of the nation?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">This mode of representing the inconveniences of restraint as light and insignificant, was a kind of sophistry in which he delighted to indulge himself, in opposition to the extreme laxity for which it has been fashionable for too many to argue, when it is evident, upon reflection, that the very essence of government is restraint; and certain it is, that as government produces rational happiness, too much restraint is better than too little. But when restraint is unnecessary, and so close as to gall those who are subject to it, the people may and ought to remonstrate; and, if relief is not granted, to resist. Of this manly and spirited principle, no man was more convinced than Johnson himself.</p>
<p class="p24">About this time Dr. Kenrick attacked him, through my sides, in a pamphlet, entitled <span class="t8">An Epistle to James Boswell, Esq., occasioned by his having transmitted the moral Writings of Dr. Samuel Johnson to Pascal Paoli, General of the Corsicans</span>. I was at first inclined to answer this pamphlet; but Johnson, who knew that my doing so would only gratify Kenrick, by keeping alive what would soon die away of itself, would not suffer me to take any notice of it.</p>
<p class="p24">His sincere regard for Francis Barber, his faithful negro servant, made him so desirous of his further improvement, that he now placed him at a school at Bishop Stortford, in Hertfordshire. This humane attention does Johnson&rsquo;s heart much honour. Out of many letters which Mr. Barber received from his master, he has preserved three, which he kindly gave me, and which I shall insert according to their dates.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To MR. FRANCIS BARBER.</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">&lsquo;DEAR FRANCIS,</span></p>
<p class="p21">&lsquo;I have been very much out of order. I am glad to hear that you are well, and design to come soon to see you. I would have you stay at Mrs. Clapp&rsquo;s for the present, till I can determine what we shall do. Be a good boy.</p>
<p class="p26">&nbsp;&rsquo;My compliments to Mrs. Clapp and to Mr. Fowler. I am,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rsquo;Your&rsquo;s affectionately,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rsquo;SAM. JOHNSON&rsquo;.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&rsquo;May 28, 1768.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Soon afterwards, he supped at the Crown and Anchor tavern, in the Strand, with a company whom I collected to meet him. They were Dr. Percy, now Bishop of Dromore, Dr. Douglas, now Bishop of Salisbury, Mr. Langton, Dr. Robertson the Historian, Dr. Hugh Blair, and Mr. Thomas Davies, who wished much to be introduced to these eminent Scotch <span class="t8">literati</span>; but on the present occasion he had very little opportunity of hearing them talk, for with an excess of prudence, for which Johnson afterwards found fault with them, they hardly opened their lips, and that only to say something which they were certain would not expose them to the sword of Goliath; such was their anxiety for their fame when in the presence of Johnson. He was this evening in remarkable vigour of mind, and eager to exert himself in conversation, which he did with great readiness and fluency; but I am sorry to find that I have preserved but a small part of what passed.</p>
<p class="p24">He allowed high praise to Thomson as a poet; but when one of the company said he was also a very good man, our moralist contested this with great warmth, accusing him of gross sensuality and licentiousness of manners. I was very much afraid that in writing Thomson&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Life</span>, Dr. Johnson would have treated his private character with a stern severity, but I was agreeably disappointed; and I may claim a little merit in it, from my having been at pains to send him authentick accounts of the affectionate and generous conduct of that poet to his sisters, one of whom, the wife of Mr. Thomson, schoolmaster at Lanark, I knew, and was presented by her with three of his letters, one of which Dr. Johnson has inserted in his <span class="t8">Life</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">He was vehement against old Dr. Mounsey, of Chelsea College, as &lsquo;a fellow who swore and talked bawdy.&rsquo; &lsquo;I have been often in his company, (said Dr. Percy,) and never heard him swear or talk bawdy.&rsquo; Mr. Davies, who sat next to Dr. Percy, having after this had some conversation aside with him, made a discovery which, in his zeal to pay court to Dr. Johnson, he eagerly proclaimed aloud from the foot of the table: &lsquo;O, Sir, I have found out a very good reason why Dr. Percy never heard Mounsey swear or talk bawdy; for he tells me, he never saw him but at the Duke of Northumberland&rsquo;s table.&rsquo; &lsquo;And so, Sir, (said Johnson loudly, to Dr. Percy,) you would shield this man from the charge of swearing and talking bawdy, because he did not do so at the Duke of Northumberland&rsquo;s table. Sir, you might as well tell us that you had seen him hold up his hand at the Old Bailey, and he neither swore nor talked bawdy; or that you had seen him in the cart at Tyburn, and he neither swore nor talked bawdy. And is it thus, Sir, that you presume to controvert what I have related?&rsquo; Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s animadversion was uttered in such a manner, that Dr. Percy seemed to be displeased, and soon afterwards left the company, of which Johnson did not at that time take any notice.</p>
<p class="p24">Swift having been mentioned, Johnson, as usual, treated him with little respect as an authour. Some of us endeavoured to support the Dean of St. Patrick&rsquo;s by various arguments. One in particular praised his <span class="t8">Conduct of the Allies</span>. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, his <span class="t8">Conduct of the Allies</span> is a performance of very little ability.&rsquo; &lsquo;Surely, Sir, (said Dr. Douglas,) you must allow it has strong facts.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why yes, Sir; but what is that to the merit of the composition? In the Sessions-paper of the Old Bailey there are strong facts. Housebreaking is a strong fact; robbery is a strong fact; and murder is a <span class="t8">mighty</span> strong fact; but is great praise due to the historian of those strong facts? No, Sir. Swift has told what he had to tell distinctly enough, but that is all. He had to count ten, and he has counted it right.&rsquo; Then recollecting that Mr. Davies, by acting as an <span class="t8">informer</span>, had been the occasion of his talking somewhat too harshly to his friend Dr. Percy, for which, probably, when the first ebullition was over, he felt some compunction, he took an opportunity to give him a hit; so added, with a preparatory laugh, &lsquo;Why, Sir, Tom Davies might have written <span class="t8">The Conduct of the Allies</span>.&rsquo; Poor Tom being thus suddenly dragged into ludicrous notice in presence of the Scottish Doctors, to whom he was ambitious of appearing to advantage, was grievously mortified. Nor did his punishment rest here; for upon subsequent occasions, whenever he, &lsquo;statesman all over,&rsquo; assumed a strutting importance, I used to hail him&mdash; &lsquo;the Authour of <span class="t8">The Conduct of the Allies</span>.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">When I called upon Dr. Johnson next morning, I found him highly satisfied with his colloquial prowess the preceding evening. &lsquo;Well, (said he,) we had good talk.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Yes, Sir; you tossed and gored several persons.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">The late Alexander, Earl of Eglintoune, who loved wit more than wine, and men of genius more than sycophants, had a great admiration of Johnson; but from the remarkable elegance of his own manners, was, perhaps, too delicately sensible of the roughness which sometimes appeared in Johnson&rsquo;s behaviour. One evening about this time, when his Lordship did me the honour to sup at my lodgings with Dr. Robertson and several other men of literary distinction, he regretted that Johnson had not been educated with more refinement, and lived more in polished society. &lsquo;No, no, my Lord, (said Signor Baretti,) do with him what you would, he would always have been a bear.&rsquo; &lsquo;True, (answered the Earl, with a smile,) but he would have been a <span class="t8">dancing</span> bear.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">To obviate all the reflections which have gone round the world to Johnson&rsquo;s prejudice, by applying to him the epithet of a <span class="t8">bear</span>, let me impress upon my readers a just and happy saying of my friend Goldsmith, who knew him well: &lsquo;Johnson, to be sure, has a roughness in his manner; but no man alive has a more tender heart. <span class="t8">He has nothing of the bear but his skin</span>.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">1769: AETAT. 60. &mdash; In 1769, so far as I can discover, the publick was favoured with nothing of Johnson&rsquo;s composition, either for himself or any of his friends. His <span class="t8">Meditations</span> too strongly prove that he suffered much both in body and mind; yet was he perpetually striving against <span class="t8">evil</span>, and nobly endeavouring to advance his intellectual and devotional improvement. Every generous and grateful heart must feel for the distresses of so eminent a benefactor to mankind; and now that his unhappiness is certainly known, must respect that dignity of character which prevented him from complaining.</p>
<p class="p24">His Majesty having the preceding year instituted the Royal Academy of Arts in London, Johnson had now the honour of being appointed Professor in Ancient Literature. In the course of the year he wrote some letters to Mrs. Thrale, passed some part of the summer at Oxford and at Lichfield, and when at Oxford wrote the following letter:</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To THE REVEREND MR. THOMAS WARTON.</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Many years ago, when I used to read in the library of your College, I promised to recompence the College for that permission, by adding to their books a Baskerville&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Virgil</span>. I have now sent it, and desire you to reposit it on the shelves in my name.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;If you will be pleased to let me know when you have an hour of leisure, I will drink tea with you. I am engaged for the afternoon, to-morrow and on Friday: all my mornings are my own.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am, &amp;c.,</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;May 31, 1769.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I came to London in the autumn, and having informed him that I was going to be married in a few months, I wished to have as much of his conversation as I could before engaging in a state of life which would probably keep me more in Scotland, and prevent me seeing him so often as when I was a single man; but I found he was at Brighthelmstone with Mr. and Mrs. Thrale. I was very sorry that I had not his company with me at the Jubilee, in honour of Shakspeare, at Stratford-upon-Avon, the great poet&rsquo;s native town. Johnson&rsquo;s connection both with Shakspeare and Garrick founded a double claim to his presence; and it would have been highly gratifying to Mr. Garrick. Upon this occasion I particularly lamented that he had not that warmth of friendship for his brilliant pupil, which we may suppose would have had a benignant effect on both. When almost every man of eminence in the literary world was happy to partake in this festival of genius, the absence of Johnson could not but be wondered at and regretted. The only trace of him there, was in the whimsical advertisement of a haberdasher, who sold <span class="t8">Shakspearian ribbands</span> of various dyes; and, by way of illustrating their appropriation to the bard, introduced a line from the celebrated Prologue at the opening of Drury-lane theatre:</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Each change of many-colour&rsquo;d life he drew.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">From Brighthelmstone Dr. Johnson wrote me the following letter, which they who may think that I ought to have suppressed, must have less ardent feelings than I have always avowed.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To JAMES BOSWELL, ESQ.</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Why do you charge me with unkindness? I have omitted nothing that could do you good, or give you pleasure, unless it be that I have forborne to tell you my opinion of your <span class="t8">Account of Corsica</span>. I believe my opinion, if you think well of my judgement, might have given you pleasure; but when it is considered how much vanity is excited by praise, I am not sure that it would have done you good. Your History is like other histories, but your Journal is in a very high degree curious and delightful. There is between the History and the Journal that difference which there will always be found between notions borrowed from without, and notions generated within. Your History was copied from books; your Journal rose out of your own experience and observation. You express images which operated strongly upon yourself, and you have impressed them with great force upon your readers. I know not whether I could name any narrative by which curiosity is better excited, or better gratified.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am glad that you are going to be married; and as I wish you well in things of less importance, wish you well with proportionate ardour in this crisis of your life. What I can contribute to your happiness, I should be very unwilling to with-hold; for I have always loved and valued you, and shall love you and value you still more, as you become more regular and useful: effects which a happy marriage will hardly fail to produce.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I do not find that I am likely to come back very soon from this place. I shall, perhaps, stay a fortnight longer; and a fortnight is a long time to a lover absent from his mistress. Would a fortnight ever have an end?</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;I am, dear Sir,<br/>&lsquo;Your most affectionate humble servant,<br/>&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;Brighthelmstone,<br/>Sept. 9, 1769.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">After his return to town, we met frequently, and I continued the practice of making notes of his conversation, though not with so much assiduity as I wish I had done. At this time, indeed, I had a sufficient excuse for not being able to appropriate so much time to my Journal; for General Paoli, after Corsica had been overpowered by the monarchy of France, was now no longer at the head of his brave countrymen, but having with difficulty escaped from his native island, had sought an asylum in Great Britain; and it was my duty, as well as my pleasure, to attend much upon him. Such particulars of Johnson&rsquo;s conversation at this period as I have committed to writing, I shall here introduce, without any strict attention to methodical arrangement. Sometimes short notes of different days shall be blended together, and sometimes a day may seem important enough to be separately distinguished.</p>
<p class="p24">He said, he would not have Sunday kept with rigid severity and gloom, but with a gravity and simplicity of behaviour.</p>
<p class="p26">I told him that David Hume had made a short collection of<br/>Scotticisms. &lsquo;I wonder, (said Johnson,) that <span class="t8">he</span> should find them.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He would not admit the importance of the question concerning the legality of general warrants. &lsquo;Such a power&rsquo; (he observed,) &lsquo;must be vested in every government, to answer particular cases of necessity; and there can be no just complaint but when it is abused, for which those who administer government must be answerable. It is a matter of such indifference, a matter about which the people care so very little, that were a man to be sent over Britain to offer them an exemption from it at a halfpenny a piece, very few would purchase it.&rsquo; This was a specimen of that laxity of talking, which I have heard him fairly acknowledge; for, surely, while the power of granting general warrants was supposed to be legal, and the apprehension of them hung over our heads, we did not possess that security of freedom, congenial to our happy constitution, and which, by the intrepid exertions of Mr. Wilkes, has been happily established.</p>
<p class="p24">He said, &lsquo;The duration of Parliament, whether for seven years or the life of the King, appears to me so immaterial, that I would not give half a crown to turn the scale one way or the other. The <span class="t8">habeas corpus</span> is the single advantage which our government has over that of other countries.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On the 30th of September we dined together at the Mitre. I attempted to argue for the superior happiness of the savage life, upon the usual fanciful topicks. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, there can be nothing more false. The savages have no bodily advantages beyond those of civilised men. They have not better health; and as to care or mental uneasiness, they are not above it, but below it, like bears. No, Sir; you are not to talk such paradox: let me have no more on&rsquo;t. It cannot entertain, far less can it instruct. Lord Monboddo, one of your Scotch Judges, talked a great deal of such nonsense. I suffered <span class="t8">him</span>; but I will not suffer <span class="t8">you</span>.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;But, Sir, does not Rousseau talk such nonsense?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;True, Sir, but Rousseau <span class="t8">knows</span> he is talking nonsense, and laughs at the world for staring at him.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;How so, Sir?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, a man who talks nonsense so well, must know that he is talking nonsense. But I am <span class="t8">afraid</span>, (chuckling and laughing,) Monboddo does <span class="t8">not</span> know that he is talking nonsense.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Is it wrong then, Sir, to affect singularity, in order to make people stare?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Yes, if you do it by propagating errour: and, indeed, it is wrong in any way. There is in human nature a general inclination to make people stare; and every wise man has himself to cure of it, and does cure himself. If you wish to make people stare by doing better than others, why, make them stare till they stare their eyes out. But consider how easy it is to make people stare by being absurd. I may do it by going into a drawing-room without my shoes. You remember the gentleman in <span class="t8">The Spectator</span>, who had a commission of lunacy taken out against him for his extreme singularity, such as never wearing a wig, but a night-cap. Now, Sir, abstractedly, the night-cap was best; but, relatively, the advantage was overbalanced by his making the boys run after him.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Talking of a London life, he said, &lsquo;The happiness of London is not to be conceived but by those who have been in it. I will venture to say, there is more learning and science within the circumference of ten miles from where we now sit, than in all the rest of the kingdom.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;The only disadvantage is the great distance at which people live from one another.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Yes, Sir; but that is occasioned by the largeness of it, which is the cause of all the other advantages.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Sometimes I have been in the humour of wishing to retire to a desart.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, you have desart enough in Scotland.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Although I had promised myself a great deal of instructive conversation with him on the conduct of the married state, of which I had then a near prospect, he did not say much upon that topick. Mr. Seward heard him once say, that &lsquo;a man has a very bad chance for happiness in that state, unless he marries a woman of very strong and fixed principles of religion.&rsquo; He maintained to me, contrary to the common notion, that a woman would not be the worse wife for being learned; in which, from all that I have observed of Artemisias, I humbly differed from him. That a woman should be sensible and well informed, I allow to be a great advantage; and think that Sir Thomas Overbury, in his rude versification, has very judiciously pointed out that degree of intelligence which is to be desired in a female companion:</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;Give me, next <span class="t8">good</span>, an <span class="t8">understanding wife</span>,<br/>By Nature <span class="t8">wise</span>, not <span class="t8">learned</span> by much art;<br/>Some <span class="t8">knowledge</span> on her side will all my life<br/>More scope of conversation impart;<br/>Besides, her inborne virtue fortifie;<br/>They are most firmly good, who best know why.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">When I censured a gentleman of my acquaintance for marrying a second time, as it shewed a disregard of his first wife, he said, &lsquo;Not at all, Sir. On the contrary, were he not to marry again, it might be concluded that his first wife had given him a disgust to marriage; but by taking a second wife he pays the highest compliment to the first, by shewing that she made him so happy as a married man, that he wishes to be so a second time.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">So ingenious a turn did he give to this delicate question. And yet, on another occasion, he owned that he once had almost asked a promise of Mrs. Johnson that she would not marry again, but had checked himself. Indeed, I cannot help thinking, that in his case the request would have been unreasonable; for if Mrs. Johnson forgot, or thought it no injury to the memory of her first love, &mdash; the husband of her youth and the father of her children, &mdash; to make a second marriage, why should she be precluded from a third, should she be so inclined? In Johnson&rsquo;s persevering fond appropriation of his <span class="t8">Tetty</span>, even after her decease, he seems totally to have overlooked the prior claim of the honest Birmingham trader. I presume that her having been married before had, at times, given him some uneasiness; for I remember his observing upon the marriage of one of our common friends, &lsquo;He has done a very foolish thing, Sir; he has married a widow, when he might have had a maid.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">We drank tea with Mrs. Williams. I had last year the pleasure of seeing Mrs. Thrale at Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s one morning, and had conversation enough with her to admire her talents, and to shew her that I was as Johnsonian as herself. Dr. Johnson had probably been kind enough to speak well of me, for this evening he delivered me a very polite card from Mr. Thrale and her, inviting me to Streatham.</p>
<p class="p24">On the 6th of October I complied with this obliging invitation, and found, at an elegant villa, six miles from town, every circumstance that can make society pleasing. Johnson, though quite at home, was yet looked up to with an awe, tempered by affection, and seemed to be equally the care of his host and hostess. I rejoiced at seeing him so happy.</p>
<p class="p24">He played off his wit against Scotland with a good humoured pleasantry, which gave me, though no bigot to national prejudices, an opportunity for a little contest with him. I having said that England was obliged to us for gardeners, almost all their good gardeners being Scotchmen. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, that is because gardening is much more necessary amongst you than with us, which makes so many of your people learn it. It is <span class="t8">all</span> gardening with you. Things which grow wild here, must be cultivated with great care in Scotland. Pray now (throwing himself back in his chair, and laughing,) are you ever able to bring the <span class="t8">sloe</span> to perfection?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I boasted that we had the honour of being the first to abolish the unhospitable, troublesome, and ungracious custom of giving vails to servants. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, you abolished vails, because you were too poor to be able to give them.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Mrs. Thrale disputed with him on the merit of Prior. He attacked him powerfully; said he wrote of love like a man who had never felt it: his love verses were college verses; and he repeated the song &lsquo;Alexis shunn&rsquo;d his fellow swains,&rsquo; &amp;c., in so ludicrous a manner, as to make us all wonder how any one could have been pleased with such fantastical stuff. Mrs. Thrale stood to her gun with great courage, in defence of amorous ditties, which Johnson despised, till he at last silenced her by saying, &lsquo;My dear Lady, talk no more of this. Nonsense can be defended but by nonsense.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Mrs. Thrale then praised Garrick&rsquo;s talent for light gay poetry; and, as a specimen, repeated his song in <span class="t8">Florizel and Perdita</span>, and dwelt with peculiar pleasure on this line:</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I&rsquo;d smile with the simple, and feed with the poor.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">JOHNSON. &lsquo;Nay, my dear Lady, this will never do. Poor David! Smile with the simple; &mdash; What folly is that? And who would feed with the poor that can help it? No, no; let me smile with the wise, and feed with the rich.&rsquo; I repeated this sally to Garrick, and wondered to find his sensibility as a writer not a little irritated by it. To sooth him, I observed, that Johnson spared none of us; and I quoted the passage in Horace, in which he compares one who attacks his friends for the sake of a laugh, to a pushing ox, that is marked by a bunch of hay put upon his horns: &lsquo;<span class="t8">fænum habet in cornu</span>.&rsquo; &lsquo;Ay, (said Garrick vehemently,) he has a whole <span class="t8">mow</span> of it.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Talking of history, Johnson said, &lsquo;We may know historical facts to be true, as we may know facts in common life to be true. Motives are generally unknown. We cannot trust to the characters we find in history, unless when they are drawn by those who knew the persons; as those, for instance, by Sallust and by Lord Clarendon.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He would not allow much merit to Whitefield&rsquo;s oratory. &lsquo;His popularity, Sir (said he,) is chiefly owing to the peculiarity of his manner. He would be followed by crowds were he to wear a night-cap in the pulpit, or were he to preach from a tree.&rsquo; I know not from what spirit of contradiction he burst out into a violent declamation against the Corsicans, of whose heroism I talked in high terms. &lsquo;Sir (said he,) what is all this rout about the Corsicans? They have been at war with the Genoese for upwards of twenty years, and have never yet taken their fortified towns. They might have battered down their walls, and reduced them to powder in twenty years. They might have pulled the walls in pieces, and cracked the stones with their teeth in twenty years.&rsquo; It was in vain to argue with him upon the want of artillery: he was not to be resisted for the moment.</p>
<p class="p24">On the evening of October 10, I presented Dr. Johnson to General Paoli. I had greatly wished that two men, for whom I had the highest esteem, should meet. They met with a manly ease, mutually conscious of their own abilities, and of the abilities of each other. The General spoke Italian, and Dr. Johnson English, and understood one another very well, with a little aid of interpretation from me, in which I compared myself to an isthmus which joins two great continents. Upon Johnson&rsquo;s approach, the General said, &lsquo;From what I have read of your works, Sir, and from what Mr. Boswell has told me of you, I have long held you in great veneration.&rsquo; The General talked of languages being formed on the particular notions and manners of a people, without knowing which, we cannot know the language. We may know the direct signification of single words; but by these no beauty of expression, no sally of genius, no wit is conveyed to the mind. All this must be by allusion to other ideas. &lsquo;Sir, (said Johnson,) you talk of language, as if you had never done any thing else but study it, instead of governing a nation.&rsquo; The General said, &lsquo;<span class="t8">Questo e un troppo gran complimento</span>;&rsquo; this is too great a compliment. Johnson answered. &lsquo;I should have thought so, Sir, if I had not heard you talk.&rsquo; The General asked him, what he thought of the spirit of infidelity which was so prevalent. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, this gloom of infidelity, I hope, is only a transient cloud passing through the hemisphere, which will soon be dissipated, and the sun break forth with his usual splendour.&rsquo; &lsquo;You think then, (said the General,) that they will change their principles like their clothes.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, if they bestow no more thought on principles than on dress, it must be so.&rsquo; The General said, that &lsquo;a great part of the fashionable infidelity was owing to a desire of shewing courage. Men who have no opportunities of shewing it as to things in this life, take death and futurity as objects on which to display it.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;That is mighty foolish affectation. Fear is one of the passions of human nature, of which it is impossible to divest it. You remember that the Emperour Charles V, when he read upon the tomb-stone of a Spanish nobleman, &ldquo;Here lies one who never knew fear,&rdquo; wittily said, &ldquo;Then he never snuffed a candle with his fingers.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He talked a few words of French to the General; but finding he did not do it with facility, he asked for pen, ink, and paper, and wrote the following note: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;J&rsquo;ai lu dans la geographie de Lucas de Linda un Pater-noster écrit dans une langue tout à-fait differente de l&rsquo;Italienne, et de toutes autres lesquelles se derivent du Latin. L&rsquo;auteur l&rsquo;appelle <span class="t8">linguam Corsicae rusticam</span>; elle a peut-etre passé peu à peu; mais elle a certainement prevalue autrefois dans les montagnes et dans la campagne. Le méme auteur dit la méme chose en parlant de Sardaigne; qu&rsquo;il y a deux langues dans l&rsquo;Isle, une des villes, l&rsquo;autre de la campagne.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">The General immediately informed him that the <span class="t8">lingua rustica</span> was only in Sardinia.</p>
<p class="p24">Dr. Johnson went home with me, and drank tea till late in the night. He said, &lsquo;General Paoli had the loftiest port of any man he had ever seen.&rsquo; He denied that military men were always the best bred men. &lsquo;Perfect good breeding, he observed, consists in having no particular mark of any profession, but a general elegance of manners; whereas, in a military man, you can commonly distinguish the <span class="t8">brand</span> of a soldier, <span class="t8">l&rsquo;homme d&rsquo;épée</span>.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Dr. Johnson shunned to-night any discussion of the perplexed question of fate and free will, which I attempted to agitate. &lsquo;Sir, (said he,) we <span class="t8">know</span> our will is free, and <span class="t8">there&rsquo;s</span> an end on&rsquo;t.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He honoured me with his company at dinner on the 16th of October, at my lodgings in Old Bond-street, with Sir Joshua Reynolds, Mr. Garrick, Dr. Goldsmith, Mr. Murphy, Mr. Bickerstaff, and Mr. Thomas Davies. Garrick played round him with a fond vivacity, taking hold of the breasts of his coat, and, looking up in his face with a lively archness, complimented him on the good health which he seemed then to enjoy; while the sage, shaking his head, beheld him with a gentle complacency. One of the company not being come at the appointed hour, I proposed, as usual upon such occasions, to order dinner to be served; adding, &lsquo;Ought six people to be kept waiting for one?&rsquo; &lsquo;Why, yes, (answered Johnson, with a delicate humanity,) if the one will suffer more by your sitting down, than the six will do by waiting.&rsquo; Goldsmith, to divert the tedious minutes, strutted about, bragging of his dress, and I believe was seriously vain of it, for his mind was wonderfully prone to such impressions. &lsquo;Come, come, (said Garrick,) talk no more of that. You are, perhaps, the worst &mdash; eh, eh!&rsquo; &mdash; Goldsmith was eagerly attempting to interrupt him, when Garrick went on, laughing ironically, &lsquo;Nay, you will always <span class="t8">look</span> like a gentleman; but I am talking of being well or <span class="t8">ill drest</span>.&rsquo; &lsquo;Well, let me tell you, (said Goldsmith,) when my tailor brought home my bloom-coloured coat, he said, &lsquo;Sir, I have a favour to beg of you. When any body asks you who made your clothes, be pleased to mention John Filby, at the Harrow, in Water-lane.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, that was because he knew the strange colour would attract crowds to gaze at it, and thus they might hear of him, and see how well he could make a coat even of so absurd a colour.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">After dinner our conversation first turned upon Pope. Johnson said, his characters of men were admirably drawn, those of women not so well. He repeated to us, in his forcible melodious manner, the concluding lines of the <span class="t8">Dunciad</span>. While he was talking loudly in praise of those lines, one of the company ventured to say, &lsquo;Too fine for such a poem: &mdash; a poem on what?&rsquo; JOHNSON, (with a disdainful look,) &lsquo;Why, on <span class="t8">dunces</span>. It was worth while being a dunce then. Ah, Sir, hadst <span class="t8">thou</span> lived in those days! It is not worth while being a dunce now, when there are no wits.&rsquo; Bickerstaff observed, as a peculiar circumstance, that Pope&rsquo;s fame was higher when he was alive than it was then. Johnson said, his Pastorals were poor things, though the versification was fine. He told us, with high satisfaction, the anecdote of Pope&rsquo;s inquiring who was the authour of his <span class="t8">London</span>, and saying, he will be soon <span class="t8">déterré</span>. He observed, that in Dryden&rsquo;s poetry there were passages drawn from a profundity which Pope could never reach. He repeated some fine lines on love, by the former, (which I have now forgotten,) and gave great applause to the character of Zimri. Goldsmith said, that Pope&rsquo;s character of Addison shewed a deep knowledge of the human heart. Johnson said, that the description of the temple, in the <span class="t8">Mourning Bride</span>, was the finest poetical passage he had ever read; he recollected none in Shakspeare equal to it. &lsquo;But, (said Garrick, all alarmed for the &ldquo;God of his idolatry,&rdquo;) we know not the extent and variety of his powers.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;We are to suppose there are such passages in his works. Shakspeare must not suffer from the badness of our memories.&rsquo; Johnson, diverted by this enthusiastick jealousy, went on with greater ardour: &lsquo;No, Sir; Congreve has <span class="t8">nature</span>;&rsquo; (smiling on the tragick eagerness of Garrick;) but composing himself, he added, &lsquo;Sir, this is not comparing Congreve on the whole, with Shakspeare on the whole; but only maintaining that Congreve has one finer passage than any that can be found in Shakspeare. Sir, a man may have no more than ten guineas in the world, but he may have those ten guineas in one piece; and so may have a finer piece than a man who has ten thousand pounds: but then he has only one ten-guinea piece. What I mean is, that you can shew me no passage where there is simply a description of material objects, without any intermixture of moral notions, which produces such an effect.&rsquo; Mr. Murphy mentioned Shakspeare&rsquo;s description of the night before the battle of Agincourt; but it was observed, it had <span class="t8">men</span> in it. Mr. Davies suggested the speech of Juliet, in which she figures herself awaking in the tomb of her ancestors. Some one mentioned the description of Dover Cliff. JOHNSON. &lsquo;No, Sir; it should be all precipice, &mdash; all vacuum. The crows impede your fall. The diminished appearance of the boats, and other circumstances, are all very good description; but do not impress the mind at once with the horrible idea of immense height. The impression is divided; you pass on by computation, from one stage of the tremendous space to another. Had the girl in <span class="t8">The Mourning Bride</span> said, she could not cast her shoe to the top of one of the pillars in the temple, it would not have aided the idea, but weakened it.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Talking of a Barrister who had a bad utterance, some one, (to rouse Johnson,) wickedly said, that he was unfortunate in not having been taught oratory by Sheridan. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Nay, Sir, if he had been taught by Sheridan, he would have cleared the room.&rsquo; GARRICK. &lsquo;Sheridan has too much vanity to be a good man.&rsquo; We shall now see Johnson&rsquo;s mode of <span class="t8">defending</span> a man; taking him into his own hands, and discriminating. JOHNSON. &lsquo;No, Sir. There is, to be sure, in Sheridan, something to reprehend, and every thing to laugh at; but, Sir, he is not a bad man. No, Sir; were mankind to be divided into good and bad, he would stand considerably within the ranks of good. And, Sir, it must be allowed that Sheridan excels in plain declamation, though he can exhibit no character.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I should, perhaps, have suppressed this disquisition concerning a person of whose merit and worth I think with respect, had he not attacked Johnson so outrageously in his <span class="t8">Life of Swift</span>, and, at the same time, treated us, his admirers, as a set of pigmies. He who has provoked the lash of wit, cannot complain that he smarts from it.</p>
<p class="p24">Mrs. Montagu, a lady distinguished for having written an Essay on Shakspeare, being mentioned. REYNOLDS. &lsquo;I think that essay does her honour.&rsquo; JOHNSON, &lsquo;Yes, Sir; it does <span class="t8">her</span> honour, but it would do nobody else honour. I have, indeed, not read it all. But when I take up the end of a web, and find it packthread, I do not expect, by looking further, to find embroidery. Sir, I will venture to say, there is not one sentence of true criticism in her book.&rsquo; GARRICK. &lsquo;But, Sir, surely it shews how much Voltaire has mistaken Shakspeare, which nobody else has done.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, nobody else has thought it worth while. And what merit is there in that? You may as well praise a schoolmaster for whipping a boy who has construed ill. No, Sir, there is no real criticism in it: none shewing the beauty of thought, as formed on the workings of the human heart.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">The admirers of this Essay may be offended at the slighting manner in which Johnson spoke of it; but let it be remembered, that he gave his honest opinion unbiased by any prejudice, or any proud jealousy of a woman intruding herself into the chair of criticism; for Sir Joshua Reynolds has told me, that when the Essay first came out, and it was not known who had written it, Johnson wondered how Sir Joshua could like it. At this time Sir Joshua himself had received no information concerning the authour, except being assured by one of our most eminent literati, that it was clear its authour did not know the Greek tragedies in the original. One day at Sir Joshua&rsquo;s table, when it was related that Mrs. Montagu, in an excess of compliment to the authour of a modern tragedy, had exclaimed, &lsquo;I tremble for Shakspeare;&rsquo; Johnson said, &lsquo;When Shakspeare has got &mdash;&mdash; for his rival, and Mrs. Montagu for his defender, he is in a poor state indeed.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson proceeded: &lsquo;The Scotchman has taken the right method in his <span class="t8">Elements of Criticism</span>. I do not mean that he has taught us any thing; but he has told us old things in a new way.&rsquo; MURPHY. &lsquo;He seems to have read a great deal of French criticism, and wants to make it his own; as if he had been for years anatomising the heart of man, and peeping into every cranny of it.&rsquo; GOLDSMITH. &lsquo;It is easier to write that book, than to read it.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;We have an example of true criticism in Burke&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Essay on the Sublime and Beautiful</span>; and, if I recollect, there is also Du Bos; and Bouhours, who shews all beauty to depend on truth. There is no great merit in telling how many plays have ghosts in them, and how this Ghost is better than that. You must shew how terrour is impressed on the human heart. In the description of night in <span class="t8">Macbeth</span>, the beetle and the bat detract from the general idea of darkness, &mdash; inspissated gloom.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Politicks being mentioned, he said, &lsquo;This petitioning is a new mode of distressing government, and a mighty easy one. I will undertake to get petitions either against quarter-guineas or half-guineas, with the help of a little hot wine. There must be no yielding to encourage this. The object is not important enough. We are not to blow up half a dozen palaces, because one cottage is burning.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">The conversation then took another turn. JOHNSON. &lsquo;It is amazing what ignorance of certain points one sometimes finds in men of eminence. A wit about town, who wrote Latin bawdy verses, asked me, how it happened that England and Scotland, which were once two kingdoms, were now one: &mdash; and Sir Fletcher Norton did not seem to know that there were such publications as the Reviews.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The ballad of Hardyknute has no great merit, if it be really ancient. People talk of nature. But mere obvious nature may be exhibited with very little power of mind.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Thursday, October 19, I passed the evening with him at his house. He advised me to complete a Dictionary of words peculiar to Scotland, of which I shewed him a specimen. &lsquo;Sir, (said he,) Ray has made a collection of north-country words. By collecting those of your country, you will do a useful thing towards the history of the language.&rsquo; He bade me also go on with collections which I was making upon the antiquities of Scotland. &lsquo;Make a large book; a folio.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;But of what use will it be, Sir?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Never mind the use; do it.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I complained that he had not mentioned Garrick in his Preface to Shakspeare; and asked him if he did not admire him. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Yes, as &ldquo;a poor player, who frets and struts his hour upon the stage;&rdquo; &mdash; as a shadow.&rsquo; BOSWELL, &lsquo;But has he not brought Shakspeare into notice?&rsquo;&nbsp; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, to allow that, would be to lampoon the age. Many of Shakspeare&rsquo;s plays are the worse for being acted: <span class="t8">Macbeth</span>, for instance.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;What, Sir, is nothing gained by decoration and action? Indeed, I do wish that you had mentioned Garrick.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;My dear Sir, had I mentioned him, I must have mentioned many more: Mrs. Pritchard, Mrs. Cibber, &mdash; nay, and Mr. Cibber too; he too altered Shakspeare.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;You have read his apology, Sir?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Yes, it is very entertaining. But as for Cibber himself, taking from his conversation all that he ought not to have said, he was a poor creature. I remember when he brought me one of his Odes to have my opinion of it; I could not bear such nonsense, and would not let him read it to the end; so little respect had I for <span class="t8">that great man</span>! (laughing.) Yet I remember Richardson wondering that I could treat him with familiarity.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I mentioned to him that I had seen the execution of several convicts at Tyburn, two days before, and that none of them seemed to be under any concern. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Most of them, Sir, have never thought at all.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;But is not the fear of death natural to man?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;So much so, Sir, that the whole of life is but keeping away the thoughts of it.&rsquo; He then, in a low and earnest tone, talked of his meditating upon the aweful hour of his own dissolution, and in what manner he should conduct himself upon that occasion: &lsquo;I know not (said he,) whether I should wish to have a friend by me, or have it all between GOD and myself.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Talking of our feeling for the distresses of others; &mdash; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, there is much noise made about it, but it is greatly exaggerated. No, Sir, we have a certain degree of feeling to prompt us to do good: more than that, Providence does not intend. It would be misery to no purpose.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;But suppose now, Sir, that one of your intimate friends were apprehended for an offence for which he might be hanged.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;I should do what I could to bail him, and give him any other assistance; but if he were once fairly hanged, I should not suffer.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Would you eat your dinner that day, Sir?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Yes, Sir; and eat it as if he were eating it with me. Why, there&rsquo;s Baretti, who is to be tried for his life to-morrow, friends have risen up for him on every side; yet if he should be hanged, none of them will eat a slice of plumb-pudding the less. Sir, that sympathetic feeling goes a very little way in depressing the mind.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I told him that I had dined lately at Foote&rsquo;s, who shewed me a letter which he had received from Tom Davies, telling him that he had not been able to sleep from the concern which he felt on account of &lsquo;<span class="t8">This sad affair of Baretti</span>,&rsquo; begging of him to try if he could suggest any thing that might be of service; and, at the same time, recommending to him an industrious young man who kept a pickle-shop. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Ay, Sir, here you have a specimen of human sympathy; a friend hanged, and a cucumber pickled. We know not whether Baretti or the pickle-man has kept Davies from sleep; nor does he know himself. And as to his not sleeping, Sir; Tom Davies is a very great man; Tom has been upon the stage, and knows how to do those things. I have not been upon the stage, and cannot do those things.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;I have often blamed myself, Sir, for not feeling for others as sensibly as many say they do.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, don&rsquo;t be duped by them any more. You will find these very feeling people are not very ready to do you good. They <span class="t8">pay</span> you by <span class="t8">feeling</span>.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">BOSWELL. &lsquo;Foote has a great deal of humour?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Yes, Sir.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;He has a singular talent of exhibiting character.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, it is not a talent; it is a vice; it is what others abstain from. It is not comedy, which exhibits the character of a species, as that of a miser gathered from many misers: it is farce, which exhibits individuals.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Did not he think of exhibiting you, Sir?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, fear restrained him; he knew I would have broken his bones. I would have saved him the trouble of cutting off a leg; I would not have left him a leg to cut off.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Pray, Sir, is not Foote an infidel?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;I do not know, Sir, that the fellow is an infidel; but if he be an infidel, he is an infidel as a dog is an infidel; that is to say, he has never thought upon the subject.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;I suppose, Sir, he has thought superficially, and seized the first notions which occurred to his mind.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why then, Sir, still he is like a dog, that snatches the piece next him. Did you never observe that dogs have not the power of comparing? A dog will take a small bit of meat as readily as a large, when both are before him.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Buchanan (he observed,) has fewer <span class="t8">centos</span> than any modern Latin poet. He not only had great knowledge of the Latin language, but was a great poetical genius. Both the Scaligers praise him.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He again talked of the passage in <span class="t8">Congreve</span> with high commendation, and said, &lsquo;Shakspeare never has six lines together without a fault. Perhaps you may find seven, but this does not refute my general assertion. If I come to an orchard, and say there&rsquo;s no fruit here, and then comes a poring man, who finds two apples and three pears, and tells me, &ldquo;Sir, you are mistaken, I have found both apples and pears,&rdquo; I should laugh at him: what would that be to the purpose?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">BOSWELL. &lsquo;What do you think of Dr. Young&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Night Thoughts</span>, Sir?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, there are very fine things in them.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Is there not less religion in the nation now, Sir, than there was formerly?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know, Sir, that there is.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;For instance, there used to be a chaplain in every great family, which we do not find now.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Neither do you find any of the state servants which great families used formerly to have. There is a change of modes in the whole department of life.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Next day, October 20, he appeared, for the only time I suppose in his life, as a witness in a Court of Justice, being called to give evidence to the character of Mr. Baretti, who having stabbed a man in the street, was arraigned at the Old Bailey for murder. Never did such a constellation of genius enlighten the aweful Sessions-House, emphatically called JUSTICE HALL; Mr. Burke, Mr. Garrick, Mr. Beauclerk, and Dr. Johnson; and undoubtedly their favourable testimony had due weight with the Court and Jury. Johnson gave his evidence in a slow, deliberate, and distinct manner, which was uncommonly impressive. It is well known that Mr. Baretti was acquitted.</p>
<p class="p24">On the 26th of October, we dined together at the Mitre tavern. I found fault with Foote for indulging his talent of ridicule at the expence of his visitors, which I colloquially termed making fools of his company. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, when you go to see Foote, you do not go to see a saint: you go to see a man who will be entertained at your house, and then bring you on a publick stage; who will entertain you at his house, for the very purpose of bringing you on a publick stage. Sir, he does not make fools of his company; they whom he exposes are fools already: he only brings them into action.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Talking of trade, he observed, &lsquo;It is a mistaken notion that a vast deal of money is brought into a nation by trade. It is not so. Commodities come from commodities; but trade produces no capital accession of wealth. However, though there should be little profit in money, there is a considerable profit in pleasure, as it gives to one nation the productions of another; as we have wines and fruits, and many other foreign articles, brought to us.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Yes, Sir, and there is a profit in pleasure, by its furnishing occupation to such numbers of mankind.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, you cannot call that pleasure to which all are averse, and which none begin but with the hope of leaving off; a thing which men dislike before they have tried it, and when they have tried it.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;But, Sir, the mind must be employed, and we grow weary when idle.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;That is, Sir, because, others being busy, we want company; but if we were all idle, there would be no growing weary; we should all entertain one another. There is, indeed, this in trade: &mdash; it gives men an opportunity of improving their situation. If there were no trade, many who are poor would always remain poor. But no man loves labour for itself.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Yes, Sir, I know a person who does. He is a very laborious Judge, and he loves the labour.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, that is because he loves respect and distinction. Could he have them without labour, he would like it less.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;He tells me he likes it for itself.&rsquo;&mdash; &lsquo;Why, Sir, he fancies so, because he is not accustomed to abstract.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">We went home to his house to tea. Mrs. Williams made it with sufficient dexterity, notwithstanding her blindness, though her manner of satisfying herself that the cups were full enough appeared to me a little aukward; for I fancied she put her finger down a certain way, till she felt the tea touch it. In my first elation at being allowed the privilege of attending Dr. Johnson at his late visits to this lady, which was like being <span class="t8">è secretioribus consiliis</span>, I willingly drank cup after cup, as if it had been the Heliconian spring. But as the charm of novelty went off, I grew more fastidious; and besides, I discovered that she was of a peevish temper.</p>
<p class="p24">There was a pretty large circle this evening. Dr. Johnson was in very good humour, lively, and ready to talk upon all subjects. Mr. Fergusson, the self-taught philosopher, told him of a new-invented machine which went without horses: a man who sat in it turned a handle, which worked a spring that drove it forward. &lsquo;Then, Sir, (said Johnson,) what is gained is, the man has his choice whether he will move himself alone, or himself and the machine too.&rsquo; Dominicetti being mentioned, he would not allow him any merit. &lsquo;There is nothing in all this boasted system. No, Sir; medicated baths can be no better than warm water: their only effect can be that of tepid moisture.&rsquo; One of the company took the other side, maintaining that medicines of various sorts, and some too of most powerful effect, are introduced into the human frame by the medium of the pores; and, therefore, when warm water is impregnated with salutiferous substances, it may produce great effects as a bath. This appeared to me very satisfactory. Johnson did not answer it; but talking for victory, and determined to be master of the field, he had recourse to the device which Goldsmith imputed to him in the witty words of one of Cibber&rsquo;s comedies: &lsquo;There is no arguing with Johnson; for when his pistol misses fire, he knocks you down with the butt end of it.&rsquo; He turned to the gentleman, &lsquo;Well, Sir, go to Dominicetti, and get thyself fumigated; but be sure that the steam be directed to thy <span class="t8">head</span>, for <span class="t8">that</span> is the <span class="t8">peccant part</span>&rsquo;. This produced a triumphant roar of laughter from the motley assembly of philosophers, printers, and dependents, male and female.</p>
<p class="p24">I know not how so whimsical a thought came into my mind, but I asked, &lsquo;If, Sir, you were shut up in a castle, and a newborn child with you, what would you do?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, I should not much like my company.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;But would you take the trouble of rearing it?&rsquo; He seemed, as may well be supposed, unwilling to pursue the subject: but upon my persevering in my question, replied, &lsquo;Why yes, Sir, I would; but I must have all conveniencies. If I had no garden, I would make a shed on the roof, and take it there for fresh air. I should feed it, and wash it much, and with warm water to please it, not with cold water to give it pain.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;But, Sir, does not heat relax?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, you are not to imagine the water is to be very hot. I would not <span class="t8">coddle</span> the child. No, Sir, the hardy method of treating children does no good. I&rsquo;ll take you five children from London, who shall cuff five Highland children. Sir, a man bred in London will carry a burthen, or run, or wrestle, as well as a man brought up in the hardiest manner in the country.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Good living, I suppose, makes the Londoners strong.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, I don&rsquo;t know that it does. Our Chairmen from Ireland, who are as strong men as any, have been brought up upon potatoes. Quantity makes up for quality.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Would you teach this child that I have furnished you with, any thing?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;No, I should not be apt to teach it.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Would not you have a pleasure in teaching it?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;No, Sir, I should <span class="t8">not</span> have a pleasure in teaching it.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Have you not a pleasure in teaching men? &mdash; <span class="t8">There</span> I have you. You have the same pleasure in teaching men, that I should have in teaching children.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, something about that.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Do you think, Sir, that what is called natural affection is born with us? It seems to me to be the effect of habit, or of gratitude for kindness. No child has it for a parent whom it has not seen.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, I think there is an instinctive natural affection in parents towards their children.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Russia being mentioned as likely to become a great empire, by the rapid increase of population: &mdash; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, I see no prospect of their propagating more. They can have no more children than they can get. I know of no way to make them breed more than they do. It is not from reason and prudence that people marry, but from inclination. A man is poor; he thinks, &ldquo;I cannot be worse, and so I&rsquo;ll e&rsquo;en take Peggy.&rdquo;&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;But have not nations been more populous at one period than another?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Yes, Sir; but that has been owing to the people being less thinned at one period than another, whether by emigrations, war, or pestilence, not by their being more or less prolifick. Births at all times bear the same proportion to the same number of people.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;But, to consider the state of our own country; &mdash; does not throwing a number of farms into one hand hurt population?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why no, Sir; the same quantity of food being produced, will be consumed by the same number of mouths, though the people may be disposed of in different ways. We see, if corn be dear, and butchers&rsquo; meat cheap, the farmers all apply themselves to the raising of corn, till it becomes plentiful and cheap, and then butchers&rsquo; meat becomes dear; so that an equality is always preserved. No, Sir, let fanciful men do as they will, depend upon it, it is difficult to disturb the system of life.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;But, Sir, is it not a very bad thing for landlords to oppress their tenants, by raising their rents?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Very bad. But, Sir, it never can have any general influence; it may distress some individuals. For, consider this: landlords cannot do without tenants. Now tenants will not give more for land, than land is worth. If they can make more of their money by keeping a shop, or any other way, they&rsquo;ll do it, and so oblige landlords to let land come back to a reasonable rent, in order that they may get tenants. Land, in England, is an article of commerce. A tenant who pays his landlord his rent, thinks himself no more obliged to him than you think yourself obliged to a man in whose shop you buy a piece of goods. He knows the landlord does not let him have his land for less than he can get from others, in the same manner as the shopkeeper sells his goods. No shopkeeper sells a yard of ribband for sixpence when seven-pence is the current price.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;But, Sir, is it not better that tenants should be dependant on landlords?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, as there are many more tenants than landlords, perhaps, strictly speaking, we should wish not. But if you please you may let your lands cheap, and so get the value, part in money and part in homage. I should agree with you in that.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;So, Sir, you laugh at schemes of political improvement.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, most schemes of political improvement are very laughable things.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He observed, &lsquo;Providence has wisely ordered that the more numerous men are, the more difficult it is for them to agree in any thing, and so they are governed. There is no doubt, that if the poor should reason, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be the poor no longer, we&rsquo;ll make the rich take their turn,&rdquo; they could easily do it, were it not that they can&rsquo;t agree. So the common soldiers, though so much more numerous than their officers, are governed by them for the same reason.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He said, &lsquo;Mankind have a strong attachment to the habitations to which they have been accustomed. You see the inhabitants of Norway do not with one consent quit it, and go to some part of America, where there is a mild climate, and where they may have the same produce from land, with the tenth part of the labour. No, Sir; their affection for their old dwellings, and the terrour of a general change, keep them at home. Thus, we see many of the finest spots in the world thinly inhabited, and many rugged spots well inhabited.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">The London Chronicle</span>, which was the only news-paper he constantly took in, being brought, the office of reading it aloud was assigned to me. I was diverted by his impatience. He made me pass over so many parts of it, that my task was very easy. He would not suffer one of the petitions to the King about the Middlesex election to be read.</p>
<p class="p24">I had hired a Bohemian as my servant while I remained in London, and being much pleased with him, I asked Dr. Johnson whether his being a Roman Catholick should prevent my taking him with me to Scotland. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why no, Sir, if <span class="t8">he</span> has no objection, you can have none.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;So, Sir, you are no great enemy to the Roman Catholick religion.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;No more, Sir, than to the Presbyterian religion.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;You are joking.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;No, Sir, I really think so. Nay, Sir, of the two, I prefer the Popish.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;How so, Sir?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, the Presbyterians have no church, no apostolical ordination.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;And do you think that absolutely essential, Sir?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, as it was an apostolical institution, I think it is dangerous to be without it. And, Sir, the Presbyterians have no public worship: they have no form of prayer in which they know they are to join. They go to hear a man pray, and are to judge whether they will join with him.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;But, Sir, their doctrine is the same with that of the Church of England. Their confession of faith, and the thirty-nine articles, contain the same points, even the doctrine of predestination.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why yes, Sir, predestination was a part of the clamour of the times, so it is mentioned in our articles, but with as little positiveness as could be.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Is it necessary, Sir, to believe all the thirty-nine articles?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, that is a question which has been much agitated. Some have thought it necessary that they should all be believed; others have considered them to be only articles of peace, that is to say, you are not to preach against them.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;It appears to me, Sir, that predestination, or what is equivalent to it, cannot be avoided, if we hold an universal prescience in the Deity.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, does not GOD every day see things going on without preventing them?&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;True, Sir; but if a thing be <span class="t8">certainly</span> foreseen, it must be fixed, and cannot happen otherwise; and if we apply this consideration to the human mind, there is no free will, nor do I see how prayer can be of any avail.&rsquo; He mentioned Dr. Clarke, and Bishop Bramhall on <span class="t8">Liberty and Necessity</span>, and bid me read South&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Sermons on Prayer</span>; but avoided the question which has excruciated philosophers and divines, beyond any other. I did not press it further, when I perceived that he was displeased, and shrunk from any abridgement of an attribute usually ascribed to the Divinity, however irreconcilable in its full extent with the grand system of moral government. His supposed orthodoxy here cramped the vigorous powers of his understanding. He was confined by a chain which early imagination and long habit made him think massy and strong, but which, had he ventured to try, he could at once have snapt asunder.</p>
<p class="p24">I proceeded: &lsquo;What do you think, Sir, of Purgatory, as believed by the Roman Catholicks?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, it is a very harmless doctrine. They are of opinion that the generality of mankind are neither so obstinately wicked as to deserve everlasting punishment, nor so good as to merit being admitted into the society of blessed spirits; and therefore that God is graciously pleased to allow of a middle state, where they may be purified by certain degrees of suffering. You see, Sir, there is nothing unreasonable in this.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;But then, Sir, their masses for the dead?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, if it be once established that there are souls in purgatory, it is as proper to pray for <span class="t8">them</span>, as for our brethren of mankind who are yet in this life.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;The idolatry of the Mass?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, there is no idolatry in the Mass. They believe GOD to be there, and they adore him.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;The worship of Saints?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, they do not worship saints; they invoke them; they only ask their prayers. I am talking all this time of the <span class="t8">doctrines</span> of the Church of Rome. I grant you that in <span class="t8">practice</span>, Purgatory is made a lucrative imposition, and that the people do become idolatrous as they recommend themselves to the tutelary protection of particular saints. I think their giving the sacrament only in one kind is criminal, because it is contrary to the express institution of CHRIST, and I wonder how the Council of Trent admitted it.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Confession?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, I don&rsquo;t know but that is a good thing. The scripture says, &ldquo;Confess your faults one to another,&rdquo; and the priests confess as well as the laity. Then it must be considered that their absolution is only upon repentance, and often upon penance also. You think your sins may be forgiven without penance, upon repentance alone.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I thus ventured to mention all the common objections against the Roman Catholick Church, that I might hear so great a man upon them. What he said is here accurately recorded. But it is not improbable that if one had taken the other side, he might have reasoned differently.</p>
<p class="p24">I must however mention, that he had a respect for &lsquo;<span class="t8">the old religion</span>,&rsquo; as the mild Melancthon called that of the Roman Catholick Church, even while he was exerting himself for its reformation in some particulars. Sir William Scott informs me, that he heard Johnson say, &lsquo;A man who is converted from Protestantism to Popery may be sincere: he parts with nothing: he is only superadding to what he already had. But a convert from Popery to Protestantism gives up so much of what he has held as sacred as any thing that he retains; there is so much <span class="t8">laceration of mind</span> in such a conversion, that it can hardly be sincere and lasting.&rsquo; The truth of this reflection may be confirmed by many and eminent instances, some of which will occur to most of my readers.</p>
<p class="p24">When we were alone, I introduced the subject of death, and endeavoured to maintain that the fear of it might be got over. I told him that David Hume said to me, he was no more uneasy to think he should <span class="t8">not be</span> after this life, than that he <span class="t8">had not been</span> before he began to exist. JOHNSON: &lsquo;Sir, if he really thinks so, his perceptions are disturbed; he is mad: if he does not think so, he lies. He may tell you, he holds his finger in the flame of a candle, without feeling pain; would you believe him? When he dies, he at least gives up all he has.&rsquo; BOSWELL: &lsquo;Foote, Sir, told me, that when he was very ill he was not afraid to die.&rsquo; JOHNSON: &lsquo;It is not true, Sir. Hold a pistol to Foote&rsquo;s breast, or to Hume&rsquo;s breast, and threaten to kill them, and you&rsquo;ll see how they behave.&rsquo; BOSWELL: &lsquo;But may we not fortify our minds for the approach of death?&rsquo; Here I am sensible I was in the wrong, to bring before his view what he ever looked upon with horrour; for although when in a celestial frame, in his <span class="t8">Vanity of human wishes</span>, he has supposed death to be &lsquo;kind Nature&rsquo;s signal for retreat,&rsquo; from this state of being to &lsquo;a happier seat,&rsquo; his thoughts upon this aweful change were in general full of dismal apprehensions. His mind resembled the vast amphitheatre, the Colisaeum at Rome. In the centre stood his judgement, which, like a mighty gladiator, combated those apprehensions that, like the wild beasts of the <span class="t8">Arena</span>, were all around in cells, ready to be let out upon him. After a conflict, he drives them back into their dens; but not killing them, they were still assailing him. To my question, whether we might not fortify our minds for the approach of death, he answered, in a passion, &lsquo;No, Sir, let it alone. It matters not how a man dies, but how he lives. The act of dying is not of importance, it lasts so short a time.&rsquo; He added, (with an earnest look,) &lsquo;A man knows it must be so, and submits. It will do him no good to whine.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I attempted to continue the conversation. He was so provoked, that he said, &lsquo;Give us no more of this;&rsquo; and was thrown into such a state of agitation, that he expressed himself in a way that alarmed and distressed me; shewed an impatience that I should leave him, and when I was going away, called to me sternly, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t let us meet to-morrow.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I went home exceedingly uneasy. All the harsh observations which I had ever heard made upon his character, crowded into my mind; and I seemed to myself like the man who had put his head into the lion&rsquo;s mouth a great many times with perfect safety, but at last had it bit off.</p>
<p class="p24">Next morning I sent him a note, stating, that I might have been in the wrong, but it was not intentionally; he was therefore, I could not help thinking, too severe upon me. That notwithstanding our agreement not to meet that day, I would call on him in my way to the city, and stay five minutes by my watch. &lsquo;You are, (said I,) in my mind, since last night, surrounded with cloud and storm. Let me have a glimpse of sunshine, and go about my affairs in serenity and chearfulness.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Upon entering his study, I was glad that he was not alone, which would have made our meeting more awkward. There were with him, Mr. Steevens and Mr. Tyers, both of whom I now saw for the first time. My note had, on his own reflection, softened him, for he received me very complacently; so that I unexpectedly found myself at ease, and joined in the conversation.</p>
<p class="p24">He said, the criticks had done too much honour to Sir Richard Blackmore, by writing so much against him. That in his <span class="t8">Creation</span> he had been helped by various wits, a line by Phillips and a line by Tickell; so that by their aid, and that of others, the poem had been made out.</p>
<p class="p24">I defended Blackmore&rsquo;s supposed lines, which have been ridiculed as absolute nonsense: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;A painted vest Prince Voltiger had on,<br/>Which from a naked Pict his grandsire won.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I maintained it to be a poetical conceit. A Pict being painted, if he is slain in battle, and a vest is made of his skin, it is a painted vest won from him, though he was naked.</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson spoke unfavourably of a certain pretty voluminous authour, saying, &lsquo;He used to write anonymous books, and then other books commending those books, in which there was something of rascality.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I whispered him, &lsquo;Well, Sir, you are now in good humour.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Yes, Sir.&rsquo; I was going to leave him, and had got as far as the staircase. He stopped me, and smiling, said, &lsquo;Get you gone <span class="t8">in</span>;&rsquo; a curious mode of inviting me to stay, which I accordingly did for some time longer.</p>
<p class="p24">This little incidental quarrel and reconciliation, which, perhaps, I may be thought to have detailed too minutely, must be esteemed as one of many proofs which his friends had, that though he might be charged with <span class="t8">bad humour</span> at times, he was always a <span class="t8">good-natured</span> man; and I have heard Sir Joshua Reynolds, a nice and delicate observer of manners, particularly remark, that when upon any occasion Johnson had been rough to any person in company, he took the first opportunity of reconciliation, by drinking to him, or addressing his discourse to him; but if he found his dignified indirect overtures sullenly neglected, he was quite indifferent, and considered himself as having done all that he ought to do, and the other as now in the wrong.</p>
<p class="p24">Being to set out for Scotland on the 10th of November, I wrote to him at Streatham, begging that he would meet me in town on the 9th; but if this should be very inconvenient to him, I would go thither. His answer was as follows: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To JAMES BOSWELL, ESQ.</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Upon balancing the inconveniences of both parties, I find it will less incommode you to spend your night here, than me to come to town. I wish to see you, and am ordered by the lady of this house to invite you hither. Whether you can come or not, I shall not have any occasion of writing to you again before your marriage, and therefore tell you now, that with great sincerity I wish you happiness.</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;I am, dear Sir,<br/>&lsquo;Your most affectionate humble servant,<br/>&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Nov. 9, 1769.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I was detained in town till it was too late on the ninth, so went to him early on the morning of the tenth of November. &lsquo;Now (said he,) that you are going to marry, do not expect more from life, than life will afford. You may often find yourself out of humour, and you may often think your wife not studious enough to please you; and yet you may have reason to consider yourself as upon the whole very happily married.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Talking of marriage in general, he observed, &lsquo;Our marriage service is too refined. It is calculated only for the best kind of marriages; whereas, we should have a form for matches of convenience, of which there are many.&rsquo; He agreed with me that there was no absolute necessity for having the marriage ceremony performed by a regular clergyman, for this was not commanded in scripture.</p>
<p class="p24">I was volatile enough to repeat to him a little epigrammatick song of mine, on matrimony, which Mr. Garrick had a few days before procured to be set to musick by the very ingenious Mr. Dibden.</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">&lsquo;A MATRIMONIAL THOUGHT.</span></p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;In the blithe days of honey-moon,<br/>With Kate&rsquo;s allurements smitten,<br/>I lov&rsquo;d her late, I lov&rsquo;d her soon,<br/>And call&rsquo;d her dearest kitten.<br/>But now my kitten&rsquo;s grown a cat,<br/>And cross like other wives,<br/>O! by my soul, my honest Mat,<br/>I fear she has nine lives.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">My illustrious friend said, &lsquo;It is very well, Sir; but you should not swear.&rsquo; Upon which I altered &lsquo;O! by my soul,&rsquo; to &lsquo;alas, alas!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He was so good as to accompany me to London, and see me into the post-chaise which was to carry me on my road to Scotland. And sure I am, that, however inconsiderable many of the particulars recorded at this time may appear to some, they will be esteemed by the best part of my readers as genuine traits of his character, contributing together to give a full, fair, and distinct view of it.</p>
<p class="p24">1770: ÆTAT. 61. &mdash; In 1770 he published a political pamphlet, entitled <span class="t8">The False Alarm</span>, intended to justify the conduct of ministry and their majority in the House of Commons, for having virtually assumed it as an axiom, that the expulsion of a Member of Parliament was equivalent to exclusion, and thus having declared Colonel Lutterel to be duly elected for the county of Middlesex, notwithstanding Mr. Wilkes had a great majority of votes. This being justly considered as a gross violation of the right of election, an alarm for the constitution extended itself all over the kingdom. To prove this alarm to be false, was the purpose of Johnson&rsquo;s pamphlet; but even his vast powers were inadequate to cope with constitutional truth and reason, and his argument failed of effect; and the House of Commons have since expunged the offensive resolution from their Journals. That the House of Commons might have expelled Mr. Wilkes repeatedly, and as often as he should be re-chosen, was not denied; but incapacitation cannot be but by an act of the whole legislature. It was wonderful to see how a prejudice in favour of government in general, and an aversion to popular clamour, could blind and contract such an understanding as Johnson&rsquo;s, in this particular case; yet the wit, the sarcasm, the eloquent vivacity which this pamphlet displayed, made it be read with great avidity at the time, and it will ever be read with pleasure, for the sake of its composition. That it endeavoured to infuse a narcotick indifference, as to publick concerns, into the minds of the people, and that it broke out sometimes into an extreme coarseness of contemptuous abuse, is but too evident.</p>
<p class="p24">It must not, however, be omitted, that when the storm of his violence subsides, he takes a fair opportunity to pay a grateful compliment to the King, who had rewarded his merit: &lsquo;These low-born rulers have endeavoured, surely without effect, to alienate the affections of the people from the only King who for almost a century has much appeared to desire, or much endeavoured to deserve them.&rsquo; And, &lsquo;Every honest man must lament, that the faction has been regarded with frigid neutrality by the Tories, who being long accustomed to signalise their principles by opposition to the Court, do not yet consider, that they have at last a King who knows not the name of party, and who wishes to be the common father of all his people.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">To this pamphlet, which was at once discovered to be Johnson&rsquo;s, several answers came out, in which, care was taken to remind the publick of his former attacks upon government, and of his now being a pensioner, without allowing for the honourable terms upon which Johnson&rsquo;s pension was granted and accepted, or the change of system which the British court had undergone upon the accession of his present Majesty. He was, however, soothed in the highest strain of panegyrick, in a poem called <span class="t8">The Remonstrance</span>, by the Rev. Mr. Stockdale, to whom he was, upon many occasions, a kind protector.</p>
<p class="p24">The following admirable minute made by him describes so well his own state, and that of numbers to whom self-examination is habitual, that I cannot omit it: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;June 1, 1770. Every man naturally persuades himself that he can keep his resolutions, nor is he convinced of his imbecility but by length of time and frequency of experiment. This opinion of our own constancy is so prevalent, that we always despise him who suffers his general and settled purpose to be overpowered by an occasional desire. They, therefore, whom frequent failures have made desperate, cease to form resolutions; and they who are become cunning, do not tell them. Those who do not make them are very few, but of their effect little is perceived; for scarcely any man persists in a course of life planned by choice, but as he is restrained from deviation by some external power. He who may live as he will, seldom lives long in the observation of his own rules.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Of this year I have obtained the following letters: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To THE REVEREND DR. FARMER, CAMBRIDGE.</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;As no man ought to keep wholly to himself any possession that may be useful to the publick, I hope you will not think me unreasonably intrusive, if I have recourse to you for such information as you are more able to give me than any other man.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;In support of an opinion which you have already placed above the need of any more support, Mr. Steevens, a very ingenious gentleman, lately of King&rsquo;s College, has collected an account of all the translations which Shakspeare might have seen and used. He wishes his catalogue to be perfect, and therefore intreats that you will favour him by the insertion of such additions as the accuracy of your inquiries has enabled you to make. To this request, I take the liberty of adding my own solicitation.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;We have no immediate use for this catalogue, and therefore do not desire that it should interrupt or hinder your more important employments. But it will be kind to let us know that you receive it.</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;I am, Sir, &amp;c.<br/>&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;Johnson&rsquo;s-court, Fleet-street,<br/>March 21, 1770.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To THE REVEREND MR. THOMAS WARTON.</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The readiness with which you were pleased to promise me some notes on Shakspeare, was a new instance of your friendship. I shall not hurry you; but am desired by Mr. Steevens, who helps me in this edition, to let you know, that we shall print the tragedies first, and shall therefore want first the notes which belong to them. We think not to incommode the readers with a supplement; and therefore, what we cannot put into its proper place, will do us no good. We shall not begin to print before the end of six weeks, perhaps not so soon.</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;I am, &amp;c.<br/>&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;<br/>&lsquo;London, June 23, 1770.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To THE REV. DR. JOSEPH WARTON.</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am revising my edition of <span class="t8">Shakspeare</span>, and remember that I formerly misrepresented your opinion of Lear. Be pleased to write the paragraph as you would have it, and send it. If you have any remarks of your own upon that or any other play, I shall gladly receive them.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Make my compliments to Mrs. Warton. I sometimes think of wandering for a few days to Winchester, but am apt to delay. I am, Sir,</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;Your most humble servant,<br/>&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Sept. 27, 1770.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;To MR. FRANCIS BARBER, AT MRS. CLAPP&rsquo;S, BISHOP-STORTFORD,<br/>HERTFORDSHIRE.</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">&lsquo;DEAR FRANCIS,</span></p>
<p class="p21">&lsquo;I am at last sat down to write to you, and should very much blame myself for having neglected you so long, if I did not impute that and many other failings to want of health. I hope not to be so long silent again. I am very well satisfied with your progress, if you can really perform the exercises which you are set; and I hope Mr. Ellis does not suffer you to impose on him, or on yourself.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Make my compliments to Mr. Ellis, and to Mrs. Clapp, and Mr. Smith.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Let me know what English books you read for your entertainment. You can never be wise unless you love reading.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Do not imagine that I shall forget or forsake you; for if, when I examine you, I find that you have not lost your time, you shall want no encouragement from</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Yours affectionately,</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;London, Sept. 25, 1770.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">&lsquo;TO THE SAME.</span></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">&lsquo;DEAR FRANCIS,</span></p>
<p class="p21">&lsquo;I hope you mind your business. I design you shall stay with Mrs. Clapp these holidays. If you are invited out you may go, if Mr. Ellis gives leave. I have ordered you some clothes, which you will receive, I believe, next week. My compliments to Mrs. Clapp and to Mr. Ellis, and Mr. Smith, &amp;c.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your affectionate,</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;December 7, 1770.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">During this year there was a total cessation of all correspondence between Dr. Johnson and me, without any coldness on either side, but merely from procrastination, continued from day to day; and as I was not in London, I had no opportunity of enjoying his company and recording his conversation. To supply this blank, I shall present my readers with some <span class="t8">Collectanea</span>, obligingly furnished to me by the Rev. Dr. Maxwell, of Falkland, in Ireland, some time assistant preacher at the Temple, and for many years the social friend of Johnson, who spoke of him with a very kind regard.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;My acquaintance with that great and venerable character commenced in the year 1754. I was introduced to him by Mr. Grierson, his Majesty&rsquo;s printer at Dublin, a gentleman of uncommon learning, and great wit and vivacity. Mr. Grierson died in Germany, at the age of twenty-seven. Dr. Johnson highly respected his abilities, and often observed, that he possessed more extensive knowledge than any man of his years he had ever known. His industry was equal to his talents; and he particularly excelled in every species of philological learning, and was, perhaps, the best critick of the age he lived in.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I must always remember with gratitude my obligation to Mr. Grierson, for the honour and happiness of Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s acquaintance and friendship, which continued uninterrupted and undiminished to his death: a connection, that was at once the pride and happiness of my life.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;What pity it is, that so much wit and good sense as he continually exhibited in conversation, should perish unrecorded! Few persons quitted his company without perceiving themselves wiser and better than they were before. On serious subjects he flashed the most interesting conviction upon his auditors; and upon lighter topicks, you might have supposed &mdash; <span class="t8">Albano musas de monte locutas</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Though I can hope to add but little to the celebrity of so exalted a character, by any communications I can furnish, yet out of pure respect to his memory, I will venture to transmit to you some anecdotes concerning him, which fell under my own observation. The very <span class="t8">minutiae</span>. of such a character must be interesting, and may be compared to the filings of diamonds.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;In politicks he was deemed a Tory, but certainly was not so in the obnoxious or party sense of the term; for while he asserted the legal and salutary prerogatives of the crown, he no less respected the constitutional liberties of the people. Whiggism, at the time of the Revolution, he said, was accompanied with certain principles; but latterly, as a mere party distinction under Walpole and the Pelhams was no better than the politicks of stock-jobbers, and the religion of infidels.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;He detested the idea of governing by parliamentary corruption, and asserted most strenuously, that a prince steadily and conspicuously pursuing the interests of his people, could not fail of parliamentary concurrence. A prince of ability, he contended, might and should be the directing soul and spirit of his own administration; in short, his own minister, and not the mere head of a party: and then, and not till then, would the royal dignity be sincerely respected.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Johnson seemed to think, that a certain degree of crown influence over the Houses of Parliament, (not meaning a corrupt and shameful dependence,) was very salutary, nay, even necessary, in our mixed government. &ldquo;For, (said he,) if the members were under no crown influence, and disqualified from receiving any gratification from Court, and resembled, as they possibly might, Pym and Haslerig, and other stubborn and sturdy members of the long Parliament, the wheels of government would be totally obstructed. Such men would oppose, merely to shew their power, from envy, jealousy, and perversity of disposition; and not gaining themselves, would hate and oppose all who did: not loving the person of the prince, and conceiving they owed him little gratitude, from the mere spirit of insolence and contradiction, they would oppose and thwart him upon all occasions.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The inseparable imperfection annexed to all human governments consisted, he said, in not being able to create a sufficient fund of virtue and principle to carry the laws into due and effectual execution. Wisdom might plan, but virtue alone could execute. And where could sufficient virtue be found? A variety of delegated, and often discretionary, powers must be entrusted somewhere; which, if not governed by integrity and conscience, would necessarily be abused, till at last the constable would sell his for a shilling.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;This excellent person was sometimes charged with abetting slavish and arbitrary principles of government. Nothing in my opinion could be a grosser calumny and misrepresentation; for how can it be rationally supposed, that he should adopt such pernicious and absurd opinions, who supported his philosophical character with so much dignity, was extremely jealous of his personal liberty and independence, and could not brook the smallest appearance of neglect or insult, even from the highest personages?</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;But let us view him in some instances of more familiar life.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;His general mode of life, during my acquaintance, seemed to be pretty uniform. About twelve o&rsquo;clock I commonly visited him, and frequently found him in bed, or declaiming over his tea, which he drank very plentifully. He generally had a levee of morning visitors, chiefly men of letters; Hawkesworth, Goldsmith, Murphy, Langton, Steevens, Beauclerk, &amp;c. &amp;c., and sometimes learned ladies, particularly I remember a French lady of wit and fashion doing him the honour of a visit. He seemed to me to be considered as a kind of publick oracle, whom every body thought they had a right to visit and consult; and doubtless they were well rewarded. I never could discover how he found time for his compositions. He declaimed all the morning, then went to dinner at a tavern, where he commonly staid late, and then drank his tea at some friend&rsquo;s house, over which he loitered a great while, but seldom took supper. I fancy he must have read and wrote chiefly in the night, for I can scarcely recollect that he ever refused going with me to a tavern, and he often went to Ranelagh, which he deemed a place of innocent recreation.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;He frequently gave all the silver in his pocket to the poor, who watched him, between his house and the tavern where he dined. He walked the streets at all hours, and said he was never robbed, for the rogues knew he had little money, nor had the appearance of having much.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Though the most accessible and communicative man alive; yet when he suspected he was invited to be exhibited, he constantly spurned the invitation.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Two young women from Staffordshire visited him when I was present, to consult him on the subject of Methodism, to which they were inclined. &ldquo;Come, (said he,) you pretty fools, dine with Maxwell and me at the Mitre, and we will talk over that subject;&rdquo; which they did, and after dinner he took one of them upon his knee, and fondled her for half an hour together.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Upon a visit to me at a country lodging near Twickenham, he asked what sort of society I had there. I told him, but indifferent; as they chiefly consisted of opulent traders, retired from business. He said, he never much liked that class of people; &ldquo;For, Sir (said he,) they have lost the civility of tradesmen, without acquiring the manners of gentlemen.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Johnson was much attached to London: he observed, that a man stored his mind better there, than any where else; and that in remote situations a man&rsquo;s body might be feasted, but his mind was starved, and his faculties apt to degenerate, from want of exercise and competition. No place, (he said,) cured a man&rsquo;s vanity or arrogance so well as London; for as no man was either great or good <span class="t8">per se</span>, but as compared with others not so good or great, he was sure to find in the metropolis many his equals, and some his superiours. He observed, that a man in London was in less danger of falling in love indiscreetly, than any where else; for there the difficulty of deciding between the conflicting pretensions of a vast variety of objects, kept him safe. He told me, that he had frequently been offered country preferment, if he would consent to take orders; but he could not leave the improved society of the capital, or consent to exchange the exhilarating joys and splendid decorations of publick life, for the obscurity, insipidity, and uniformity of remote situations.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Speaking of Mr. Harte, Canon of Windsor, and writer of <span class="t8">The History of Gustavus Adolphus</span>, he much commended him as a scholar, and a man of the most companionable talents he had ever known. He said, the defects in his history proceeded not from imbecility, but from foppery.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;He loved, he said, the old black letter books; they were rich in matter, though their style was inelegant; wonderfully so, considering how conversant the writers were with the best models of antiquity.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Burton&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Anatomy of Melancholy</span>, he said, was the only book that ever took him out of bed two hours sooner than he wished to rise.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;He frequently exhorted me to set about writing a History of Ireland, and archly remarked, there had been some good Irish writers, and that one Irishman might at least aspire to be equal to another. He had great compassion for the miseries and distresses of the Irish nation, particularly the Papists; and severely reprobated the barbarous debilitating policy of the British government, which, he said, was the most detestable mode of persecution. To a gentleman, who hinted such policy might be necessary to support the authority of the English government, he replied by saying, &ldquo;Let the authority of the English government perish, rather than be maintained by iniquity. Better would it be to restrain the turbulence of the natives by the authority of the sword, and to make them amenable to law and justice by an effectual and vigorous police, than to grind them to powder by all manner of disabilities and incapacities. Better (said he,) to hang or drown people at once, than by an unrelenting persecution to beggar and starve them.&rdquo; The moderation and humanity of the present times have, in some measure, justified the wisdom of his observations.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Dr. Johnson was often accused of prejudices, nay, antipathy, with regard to the natives of Scotland. Surely, so illiberal a prejudice never entered his mind: and it is well known, many natives of that respectable country possessed a large share in his esteem; nor were any of them ever excluded from his good offices, as far as opportunity permitted. True it is, he considered the Scotch, nationally, as a crafty, designing people, eagerly attentive to their own interest, and too apt to overlook the claims and pretentions of other people. &ldquo;While they confine their benevolence, in a manner, exclusively to those of their own country, they expect to share in the good offices of other people. Now (said Johnson,) this principle is either right or wrong; if right, we should do well to imitate such conduct; if wrong, we cannot too much detest it.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Being solicited to compose a funeral sermon for the daughter of a tradesman, he naturally enquired into the character of the deceased; and being told she was remarkable for her humility and condescension to inferiours, he observed, that those were very laudable qualities, but it might not be so easy to discover who the lady&rsquo;s inferiours were.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Of a certain player he remarked, that his conversation usually threatened and announced more than it performed; that he fed you with a continual renovation of hope, to end in a constant succession of disappointment.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;When exasperated by contradiction, he was apt to treat his opponents with too much acrimony: as, &ldquo;Sir, you don&rsquo;t see your way through that question:&rdquo;&mdash; &ldquo;Sir, you talk the language of ignorance.&rdquo; On my observing to him that a certain gentleman had remained silent the whole evening, in the midst of a very brilliant and learned society, &ldquo;Sir, (said he,) the conversation overflowed, and drowned him.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;His philosophy, though austere and solemn, was by no means morose and cynical, and never blunted the laudable sensibilities of his character, or exempted him from the influence of the tender passions. Want of tenderness, he always alledged, was want of parts, and was no less a proof of stupidity than depravity.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Speaking of Mr. Hanway, who published <span class="t8">An Eight Days&rsquo; Journey from London to Portsmouth</span>, &ldquo;Jonas, (said he,) acquired some reputation by travelling abroad, but lost it all by travelling at home.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Of the passion of love he remarked, that its violence and ill effects were much exaggerated; for who knows any real sufferings on that head, more than from the exorbitancy of any other passion?</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;He much commended <span class="t8">Law&rsquo;s Serious Call</span>, which he said was the finest piece of hortatory theology in any language. &ldquo;Law, (said he,) fell latterly into the reveries of Jacob Behmen, whom Law alledged to have been somewhat in the same state with St. Paul, and to have seen unutterable things &mdash; he would have resembled St. Paul still more, by not attempting to utter them.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;He observed, that the established clergy in general did not preach plain enough; and that polished periods and glittering sentences flew over the heads of the common people, without any impression upon their hearts. Something might be necessary, he observed, to excite the affections of the common people, who were sunk in languor and lethargy, and therefore he supposed that the new concomitants of methodism might probably produce so desirable an effect. The mind, like the body, he observed, delighted in change and novelty, and even in religion itself, courted new appearances and modifications. Whatever might be thought of some methodist teachers, he said, he could scarcely doubt the sincerity of that man, who travelled nine hundred miles in a month, and preached twelve times a week; for no adequate reward, merely temporal, could be given for such indefatigable labour.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Of Dr. Priestley&rsquo;s theological works, he remarked, that they tended to unsettle every thing, and yet settled nothing.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;He was much affected by the death of his mother, and wrote to me to come and assist him to compose his mind, which indeed I found extremely agitated. He lamented that all serious and religious conversation was banished from the society of men, and yet great advantages might be derived from it. All acknowledged, he said, what hardly any body practised, the obligation we were under of making the concerns of eternity the governing principles of our lives. Every man, he observed, at last wishes for retreat: he sees his expectations frustrated in the world, and begins to wean himself from it, and to prepare for everlasting separation.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;He observed, that the influence of London now extended every where, and that from all manner of communication being opened, there shortly would be no remains of the ancient simplicity, or places of cheap retreat to be found.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;He was no admirer of blank-verse, and said it always failed, unless sustained by the dignity of the subject. In blank-verse, he said, the language suffered more distortion, to keep it out of prose, than any inconvenience or limitation to be apprehended from the shackles and circumspection of rhyme.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;He reproved me once for saying grace without mention of the name of our LORD JESUS CHRIST, and hoped in future I would be more mindful of the apostolical injunction.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;He refused to go out of a room before me at Mr. Langton&rsquo;s house, saying, he hoped he knew his rank better than to presume to take place of a Doctor in Divinity. I mention such little anecdotes, merely to shew the peculiar turn and habit of his mind.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;He used frequently to observe, that there was more to be endured than enjoyed, in the general condition of human life; and frequently quoted those lines of Dryden:</p>
<p class="p26">&ldquo;Strange cozenage! none would live past years again,<br/>Yet all hope pleasure from what still remain.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">For his part, he said, he never passed that week in his life which he would wish to repeat, were an angel to make the proposal to him.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;He was of opinion, that the English nation cultivated both their soil and their reason better than any other people: but admitted that the French, though not the highest, perhaps, in any department of literature, yet in every department were very high. Intellectual pre-eminence, he observed, was the highest superiority; and that every nation derived their highest reputation from the splendour and dignity of their writers. Voltaire, he said, was a good narrator, and that his principal merit consisted in a happy selection and arrangement of circumstances.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Speaking of the French novels, compared with Richardson&rsquo;s, he said, they might be pretty baubles, but a wren was not an eagle.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;In a Latin conversation with the Père Boscovitch, at the house of Mrs. Cholmondeley, I heard him maintain the superiority of Sir Isaac Newton over all foreign philosophers, with a dignity and eloquence that surprized that learned foreigner. It being observed to him, that a rage for every thing English prevailed much in France after Lord Chatham&rsquo;s glorious war, he said, he did not wonder at it, for that we had drubbed those fellows into a proper reverence for us, and that their national petulance required periodical chastisement.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Lord Lyttelton&rsquo;s Dialogues, he deemed a nugatory performance. &ldquo;That man, (said he,) sat down to write a book, to tell the world what the world had all his life been telling him.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Somebody observing that the Scotch Highlanders, in the year 1745, had made surprising efforts, considering their numerous wants and disadvantages: &ldquo;Yes, Sir, (said he,) their wants were numerous; but you have not mentioned the greatest of them all, &mdash; the want of law.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Speaking of the <span class="t8">inward light</span>, to which some methodists pretended, he said, it was a principle utterly incompatible with social or civil security. &ldquo;If a man (said he,) pretends to a principle of action of which I can know nothing, nay, not so much as that he has it, but only that he pretends to it; how can I tell what that person may be prompted to do? When a person professes to be governed by a written ascertained law, I can then know where to find him.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The poem of <span class="t8">Fingal</span>, he said, was a mere unconnected rhapsody, a tiresome repetition of the same images. &ldquo;In vain shall we look for the <span class="t8">lucidus ordo</span>&rsquo;, where there is neither end or object, design or moral, <span class="t8">nec certa recurrit imago</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Being asked by a young nobleman, what was become of the gallantry and military spirit of the old English nobility, he replied, &ldquo;Why, my Lord, I&rsquo;ll tell you what is become of it; it is gone into the city to look for a fortune.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Speaking of a dull tiresome fellow, whom he chanced to meet, he said, &ldquo;That fellow seems to me to possess but one idea, and that is a wrong one.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Much enquiry having been made concerning a gentleman, who had quitted a company where Johnson was, and no information being obtained; at last Johnson observed, that &ldquo;he did not care to speak ill of any man behind his back, but he believed the gentleman was an <span class="t8">attorney</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;He spoke with much contempt of the notice taken of Woodhouse, the poetical shoemaker. He said, it was all vanity and childishness: and that such objects were, to those who patronised them, mere mirrours of their own superiority. &ldquo;They had better (said he,) furnish the man with good implements for his trade, than raise subscriptions for his poems. He may make an excellent shoemaker, but can never make a good poet. A school-boy&rsquo;s exercise may be a pretty thing for a school-boy; but it is no treat for a man.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Speaking of Boetius, who was the favourite writer of the middle ages, he said it was very surprizing, that upon such a subject, and in such a situation, he should be <span class="t8">magis philosophius quàm Christianus</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Speaking of Arthur Murphy, whom he very much loved, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know (said he,) that Arthur can be classed with the very first dramatick writers; yet at present I doubt much whether we have any thing superiour to Arthur.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Speaking of the national debt, he said, it was an idle dream to suppose that the country could sink under it. Let the public creditors be ever so clamorous, the interest of millions must ever prevail over that of thousands.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Of Dr. Kennicott&rsquo;s Collations, he observed, that though the text should not be much mended thereby, yet it was no small advantage to know, that we had as good a text as the most consummate industry and diligence could procure.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Johnson observed, that so many objections might be made to every thing, that nothing could overcome them but the necessity of doing something. No man would be of any profession, as simply opposed to not being of it: but every one must do something.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;He remarked, that a London parish was a very comfortless thing; for the clergyman seldom knew the face of one out of ten of his parishioners.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Of the late Mr. Mallet he spoke with no great respect: said, he was ready for any dirty job: that he had wrote against Byng at the instigation of the ministry, and was equally ready to write for him, provided he found his account in it.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;A gentleman who had been very unhappy in marriage, married immediately after his wife died: Johnson said, it was the triumph of hope over experience.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;He observed, that a man of sense and education should meet a suitable companion in a wife. It was a miserable thing when the conversation could only be such as, whether the mutton should be boiled or roasted, and probably a dispute about that.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;He did not approve of late marriages, observing that more was lost in point of time, than compensated for by any possible advantages. Even ill assorted marriages were preferable to cheerless celibacy.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Of old Sheridan he remarked, that he neither wanted parts nor literature; but that his vanity and Quixotism obscured his merits.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;He said, foppery was never cured; it was the bad stamina of the mind, which, like those of the body, were never rectified: once a coxcomb, and always a coxcomb.</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;Being told that Gilbert Cowper called him the Caliban of literature;<br/>&ldquo;Well, (said he,) I must dub him the Punchinello.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Speaking of the old Earl of Corke and Orrery, he said, &ldquo;that man spent his life in catching at an object, [literary eminence,] which he had not power to grasp.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To find a substitution for violated morality, he said, was the leading feature in all perversions of religion.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;He often used to quote, with great pathos, those fine lines of Virgil:</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;Optima quaeque dies miseris mortalibus aevi<br/>Prima fugit; subeunt morbi, tristisque senectus,<br/>Et labor, et durae rapit inclementia mortis.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Speaking of Homer, whom he venerated as the prince of poets, Johnson remarked that the advice given to Diomed by his father, when he sent him to the Trojan war, was the noblest exhortation that could be instanced in any heathen writer, and comprised in a single line:</p>
<p class="p24">[Greek: Aien aristeuein, kai hupeirochon emmenai allon ]</p>
<p class="p24">which, if I recollect well, is translated by Dr. Clarke thus: <span class="t8">semper appetere praestantissima, et omnibus aliis antecellere</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;He observed, &ldquo;it was a most mortifying reflexion for any man to consider, <span class="t8">what he had done</span>, compared with what <span class="t8">he might have done</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;He said few people had intellectual resources sufficient to forego the pleasures of wine. They could not otherwise contrive how to fill the interval between dinner and supper.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;He went with me, one Sunday, to hear my old Master, Gregory Sharpe, preach at the Temple. In the prefatory prayer, Sharpe ranted about <span class="t8">Liberty</span>, as a blessing most fervently to be implored, and its continuance prayed for. Johnson observed, that our <span class="t8">liberty</span> was in no sort of danger: &mdash; he would have done much better, to pray against our <span class="t8">licentiousness</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;One evening at Mrs. Montagu&rsquo;s, where a splendid company was assembled, consisting of the most eminent literary characters, I thought he seemed highly pleased with the respect and attention that were shewn him, and asked him on our return home if he was not highly <span class="t8">gratified</span> by his visit: &ldquo;No, Sir, (said he) not highly <span class="t8">gratified</span>; yet I do not recollect to have passed many evenings <span class="t8">with fewer objections</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Though of no high extraction himself, he had much respect for birth and family, especially among ladies. He said, &ldquo;adventitious accomplishments may be possessed by all ranks; but one may easily distinguish the <span class="t8">born gentlewoman</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;He said, &ldquo;the poor in England were better provided for, than in any other country of the same extent: he did not mean little Cantons, or petty Republicks. Where a great proportion of the people (said he,) are suffered to languish in helpless misery, that country must be ill policed, and wretchedly governed: a decent provision for the poor, is the true test of civilization. &mdash; Gentlemen of education, he observed, were pretty much the same in all countries; the condition of the lower orders, the poor especially, was the true mark of national discrimination.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;When the corn laws were in agitation in Ireland, by which that country has been enabled not only to feed itself, but to export corn to a large amount; Sir Thomas Robinson observed, that those laws might be prejudicial to the corn-trade of England. &ldquo;Sir Thomas, (said he,) you talk the language of a savage: what, Sir? would you prevent any people from feeding themselves, if by any honest means they can do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;It being mentioned, that Garrick assisted Dr. Brown, the authour of the <span class="t8">Estimate</span>, in some dramatick composition, &ldquo;No, Sir, (said Johnson,) he would no more suffer Garrick to write a line in his play, than he would suffer him to mount his pulpit.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Speaking of Burke, he said, &ldquo;It was commonly observed, he spoke too often in parliament; but nobody could say he did not speak well, though too frequently and too familiarly.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Speaking of economy, he remarked, it was hardly worth while to save anxiously twenty pounds a year. If a man could save to that degree, so as to enable him to assume a different rank in society, then indeed, it might answer some purpose.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;He observed, a principal source of erroneous judgement was, viewing things partially and only on <span class="t8">one side</span>: as for instance, <span class="t8">fortune-hunters</span>, when they contemplated the fortunes <span class="t8">singly</span> and <span class="t8">separately</span>, it was a dazzling and tempting object; but when they came to possess the wives and their fortunes <span class="t8">together</span>, they began to suspect that they had not made quite so good a bargain.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Speaking of the late Duke of Northumberland living very magnificently when Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, somebody remarked it would be difficult to find a suitable successor to him: then exclaimed Johnson, <span class="t8">he is only fit to succeed himself</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;He advised me, if possible, to have a good orchard. He knew, he said, a clergyman of small income, who brought up a family very reputably which he chiefly fed with apple dumplings.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;He said, he had known several good scholars among the Irish gentlemen; but scarcely any of them correct in <span class="t8">quantity</span>. He extended the same observation to Scotland.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Speaking of a certain Prelate, who exerted himself very laudably in building churches and parsonage-houses; &ldquo;however, said he, I do not find that he is esteemed a man of much professional learning, or a liberal patron of it; &mdash; yet, it is well, where a man possesses any strong positive excellence. &mdash; Few have all kinds of merit belonging to their character. We must not examine matters too deeply &mdash; No, Sir, a <span class="t8">fallible being will fail somewhere</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Talking of the Irish clergy, he said, Swift was a man of great parts, and the instrument of much good to his country. &mdash; Berkeley was a profound scholar, as well as a man of fine imagination; but Usher, he said, was the great luminary of the Irish church; and a greater, he added, no church could boast of; at least in modern times.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;We dined <span class="t8">tête à tête</span> at the Mitre, as I was preparing to return to Ireland, after an absence of many years. I regretted much leaving London, where I had formed many agreeable connexions: &ldquo;Sir, (said he,) I don&rsquo;t wonder at it; no man, fond of letters, leaves London without regret. But remember, Sir, you have seen and enjoyed a great deal; &mdash; you have seen life in its highest decorations, and the world has nothing new to exhibit. No man is so well qualifyed to leave publick life as he who has long tried it and known it well. We are always hankering after untried situations, and imagining greater felicity from them than they can afford. No, Sir, knowledge and virtue may be acquired in all countries, and your local consequence will make you some amends for the intellectual gratifications you relinquish.&rdquo; Then he quoted the following lines with great pathos: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p26">&ldquo;He who has early known the pomps of state,<br/>(For things unknown, &rsquo;tis ignorance to condemn;)<br/>And after having viewed the gaudy bait,<br/>Can boldly say, the trifle I contemn;<br/>With such a one contented could I live,<br/>Contented could I die;&rdquo; &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;He then took a most affecting leave of me; said, he knew, it was a point of <span class="t8">duty</span> that called me away. &ldquo;We shall all be sorry to lose you,&rdquo; said he: &ldquo;<span class="t8">laudo tamen</span>.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">1771: AETAT. 62. &mdash; In 1771 he published another political pamphlet, entitled <span class="t8">Thoughts on the late Transactions respecting Falkland&rsquo;s Islands</span>, in which, upon materials furnished to him by ministry, and upon general topicks expanded in his richest style, he successfully endeavoured to persuade the nation that it was wise and laudable to suffer the question of right to remain undecided, rather than involve our country in another war. It has been suggested by some, with what truth I shall not take upon me to decide, that he rated the consequence of those islands to Great-Britain too low. But however this may be, every humane mind must surely applaud the earnestness with which he averted the calamity of war; a calamity so dreadful, that it is astonishing how civilised, nay, Christian nations, can deliberately continue to renew it. His description of its miseries in this pamphlet, is one of the finest pieces of eloquence in the English language. Upon this occasion, too, we find Johnson lashing the party in opposition with unbounded severity, and making the fullest use of what he ever reckoned a most effectual argumentative instrument, &mdash; contempt. His character of their very able mysterious champion, JUNIUS, is executed with all the force of his genius, and finished with the highest care. He seems to have exulted in sallying forth to single combat against the boasted and formidable hero, who bade defiance to &lsquo;principalities and powers, and the rulers of this world.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">This pamphlet, it is observable, was softened in one particular, after the first edition; for the conclusion of Mr. George Grenville&rsquo;s character stood thus: &lsquo;Let him not, however, be depreciated in his grave. He had powers not universally possessed: could he have enforced payment of the Manilla ransom, <span class="t8">he could have counted it</span>.&rsquo; Which, instead of retaining its sly sharp point, was reduced to a mere flat unmeaning expression, or, if I may use the word, &mdash; <span class="t8">truism</span>: &lsquo;He had powers not universally possessed: and if he sometimes erred, he was likewise sometimes right.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To BENNET LANGTON, ESQ.</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;After much lingering of my own, and much of the ministry, I have at length got out my paper. But delay is not yet at an end: Not many had been dispersed, before Lord North ordered the sale to stop. His reasons I do not distinctly know. You may try to find them in the perusal. Before his order, a sufficient number were dispersed to do all the mischief, though, perhaps, not to make all the sport that might be expected from it.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Soon after your departure, I had the pleasure of finding all the danger past with which your navigation was threatened. I hope nothing happens at home to abate your satisfaction; but that Lady Rothes, and Mrs. Langton, and the young ladies, are all well.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I was last night at THE CLUB. Dr. Percy has written a long ballad in many <span class="t8">fits</span>; it is pretty enough. He has printed, and will soon publish it. Goldsmith is at Bath, with Lord Clare. At Mr. Thrale&rsquo;s, where I am now writing, all are well. I am, dear Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your most humble servant,</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;March 20, 1771.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Mr. Strahan, the printer, who had been long in intimacy with Johnson, in the course of his literary labours, who was at once his friendly agent in receiving his pension for him, and his banker in supplying him with money when he wanted it; who was himself now a Member of Parliament, and who loved much to be employed in political negociation; thought he should do eminent service both to government and Johnson, if he could be the means of his getting a seat in the House of Commons. With this view, he wrote a letter to one of the Secretaries of the Treasury, of which he gave me a copy in his own hand-writing, which is as follows: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;You will easily recollect, when I had the honour of waiting upon you some time ago, I took the liberty to observe to you, that Dr. Johnson would make an excellent figure in the House of Commons, and heartily wished he had a seat there. My reasons are briefly these:</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I know his perfect good affection to his Majesty, and his government, which I am certain he wishes to support by every means in his power.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;He possesses a great share of manly, nervous, and ready eloquence; is quick in discerning the strength and weakness of an argument; can express himself with clearness and precision, and fears the face of no man alive.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;His known character, as a man of extraordinary sense and unimpeached virtue, would secure him the attention of the House, and could not fail to give him a proper weight there.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;He is capable of the greatest application, and can undergo any degree of labour, where he sees it necessary, and where his heart and affections are strongly engaged. His Majesty&rsquo;s ministers might therefore securely depend on his doing, upon every proper occasion, the utmost that could be expected from him. They would find him ready to vindicate such measures as tended to promote the stability of government, and resolute and steady in carrying them into execution. Nor is any thing to be apprehended from the supposed impetuosity of his temper. To the friends of the King you will find him a lamb, to his enemies a lion.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;For these reasons, I humbly apprehend that he would be a very able and useful member. And I will venture to say, the employment would not be disagreeable to him; and knowing, as I do, his strong affection to the King, his ability to serve him in that capacity, and the extreme ardour with which I am convinced he would engage in that service, I must repeat, that I wish most heartily to see him in the House.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;If you think this worthy of attention, you will be pleased to take a convenient opportunity of mentioning it to Lord North. If his Lordship should happily approve of it, I shall have the satisfaction of having been, in some degree, the humble instrument of doing my country, in my opinion, a very essential service. I know your good-nature, and your zeal for the publick welfare, will plead my excuse for giving you this trouble. I am, with the greatest respect, Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your most obedient and humble servant,</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">&lsquo;WILLIAM STRAHAN.&rsquo;</span></p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;New-street,<br/>March 30, 1771.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">This recommendation, we know, was not effectual; but how, or for what reason, can only be conjectured. It is not to be believed that Mr. Strahan would have applied, unless Johnson had approved of it. I never heard him mention the subject; but at a later period of his life, when Sir Joshua Reynolds told him that Mr. Edmund Burke had said, that if he had come early into parliament, he certainly would have been the greatest speaker that ever was there, Johnson exclaimed, &lsquo;I should like to try my hand now.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">It has been much agitated among his friends and others, whether he would have been a powerful speaker in Parliament, had he been brought in when advanced in life. I am inclined to think that his extensive knowledge, his quickness and force of mind, his vivacity and richness of expression, his wit and humour, and above all his poignancy of sarcasm, would have had great effect in a popular assembly; and that the magnitude of his figure, and striking peculiarity of his manner, would have aided the effect. But I remember it was observed by Mr. Flood, that Johnson, having been long used to sententious brevity and the short flights of conversation, might have failed in that continued and expanded kind of argument, which is requisite in stating complicated matters in publick speaking; and as a proof of this he mentioned the supposed speeches in Parliament written by him for the magazine, none of which, in his opinion, were at all like real debates. The opinion of one who was himself so eminent an orator, must be allowed to have great weight. It was confirmed by Sir William Scott, who mentioned that Johnson had told him that he had several times tried to speak in the Society of Arts and Sciences, but &lsquo;had found he could not get on.&rsquo; From Mr. William Gerrard Hamilton I have heard that Johnson, when observing to him that it was prudent for a man who had not been accustomed to speak in publick, to begin his speech in as simple a manner as possible, acknowledged that he rose in that society to deliver a speech which he had prepared; &lsquo;but (said he), all my flowers of oratory forsook me.&rsquo; I however cannot help wishing, that he <span class="t8">had</span> &lsquo;tried his hand&rsquo; in Parliament; and I wonder that ministry did not make the experiment.</p>
<p class="p24">I at length renewed a correspondence which had been too long discontinued: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To DR. JOHNSON.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Edinburgh, April 18, 1771.</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">&lsquo;MY DEAR SIR,</span></p>
<p class="p21">&lsquo;I can now fully understand those intervals of silence in your correspondence with me, which have often given me anxiety and uneasiness; for although I am conscious that my veneration and love for Mr. Johnson have never in the least abated, yet I have deferred for almost a year and a half to write to him.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p26">In the subsequent part of this letter, I gave him an account of my<br/>comfortable life as a married man, and a lawyer in practice at the<br/>Scotch bar; invited him to Scotland, and promised to attend him to the<br/>Highlands, and Hebrides.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To JAMES BOSWELL, ESQ.</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;If you are now able to comprehend that I might neglect to write without diminution of affection, you have taught me, likewise, how that neglect may be uneasily felt without resentment. I wished for your letter a long time, and when it came, it amply recompensed the delay. I never was so much pleased as now with your account of yourself; and sincerely hope, that between publick business, improving studies, and domestick pleasures, neither melancholy nor caprice will find any place for entrance. Whatever philosophy may determine of material nature, it is certainly true of intellectual nature, that it <span class="t8">abhors a vacuum</span>: our minds cannot be empty; and evil will break in upon them, if they are not pre-occupied by good. My dear Sir, mind your studies, mind your business, make your lady happy, and be a good Christian. After this,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;tristitiam et metus Trades protervis in mare Creticum Portare ventis.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;If we perform our duty, we shall be safe and steady, &ldquo;<span class="t8">Sive per</span>,&rdquo; &amp;c., whether we climb the Highlands, or are tost among the Hebrides; and I hope the time will come when we may try our powers both with cliffs and water. I see but little of Lord Elibank, I know not why; perhaps by my own fault. I am this day going into Staffordshire and Derbyshire for six weeks.</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;I am, dear Sir,<br/>&lsquo;Your most affectionate,<br/>&lsquo;And most humble servant,<br/>&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;<br/>&lsquo;London, June 20, 1771.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To SIR JOSHUA REYNOLDS, IN LEICESTER-FIELDS.</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;When I came to Lichfield, I found that my portrait had been much visited, and much admired. Every man has a lurking wish to appear considerable in his native place; and I was pleased with the dignity conferred by such a testimony of your regard.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Be pleased, therefore, to accept the thanks of, Sir, your most obliged</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;And most humble servant,<br/>&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;Ashbourn in Derbyshire,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;July 17, 1771.<br/>&lsquo;Compliments to Miss Reynolds,&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;To DR. JOHNSON.<br/>&lsquo;Edinburgh, July 27, 1771.</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">&lsquo;MY DEAR SIR,</span></p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;The bearer of this, Mr. Beattie, Professor of Moral Philosophy at<br/>Aberdeen, is desirous of being introduced to your acquaintance.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;His genius and learning, and labours in the service of virtue and religion, render him very worthy of it; and as he has a high esteem of your character, I hope you will give him a favourable reception. I ever am, &amp;c.</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;JAMES BOSWELL.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To BENNET LANGTON, ESQ., AT LANGTON, NEAR SPILSBY, LINCOLNSHIRE.</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am lately returned from Staffordshire and Derbyshire. The last letter mentions two others which you have written to me since you received my pamphlet. Of these two I never had but one, in which you mentioned a design of visiting Scotland, and, by consequence, put my journey to Langton out of my thoughts. My summer wanderings are now over, and I am engaging in a very great work, the revision of my Dictionary; from which I know not, at present, how to get loose.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;If you have observed, or been told, any errours or omissions, you will do me a great favour by letting me know them.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Lady Rothes, I find, has disappointed you and herself. Ladies will have these tricks. The Queen and Mrs. Thrale, both ladies of experience, yet both missed their reckoning this summer. I hope, a few months will recompence your uneasiness.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Please to tell Lady Rothes how highly I value the honour of her invitation, which it is my purpose to obey as soon as I have disengaged myself. In the mean time I shall hope to hear often of her Ladyship, and every day better news and better, till I hear that you have both the happiness, which to both is very sincerely wished, by, Sir,</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;Your most affectionate, and<br/>&lsquo;Most humble servant,<br/>&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;August 29, 1771.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">In October I again wrote to him, thanking him for his last letter, and his obliging reception of Mr. Beattie; informing him that I had been at Alnwick lately, and had good accounts of him from Dr. Percy.</p>
<p class="p24">In his religious record of this year, we observe that he was better than usual, both in body and mind, and better satisfied with the regularity of his conduct. But he is still &lsquo;trying his ways&rsquo; too rigorously. He charges himself with not rising early enough; yet he mentions what was surely a sufficient excuse for this, supposing it to be a duty seriously required, as he all his life appears to have thought it. &lsquo;One great hindrance is want of rest; my nocturnal complaints grow less troublesome towards morning; and I am tempted to repair the deficiencies of the night.&rsquo; Alas! how hard would it be if this indulgence were to be imputed to a sick man as a crime. In his retrospect on the following Easter-Eve, he says, &lsquo;When I review the last year, I am able to recollect so little done, that shame and sorrow, though perhaps too weakly, come upon me.&rsquo; Had he been judging of any one else in the same circumstances, how clear would he have been on the favourable side. How very difficult, and in my opinion almost constitutionally impossible it was for him to be raised early, even by the strongest resolutions, appears from a note in one of his little paper-books, (containing words arranged for his <span class="t8">Dictionary</span>,) written, I suppose, about 1753: &lsquo;I do not remember that since I left Oxford I ever rose early by mere choice, but once or twice at Edial, and two or three times for the <span class="t8">Rambler</span>.&rsquo; I think he had fair ground enough to have quieted his mind on this subject, by concluding that he was physically incapable of what is at best but a commodious regulation.</p>
<p class="p24">In 1772 he was altogether quiescent as an authour; but it will be found from the various evidences which I shall bring together that his mind was acute, lively, and vigorous.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To SIR JOSHUA REYNOLDS.</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Be pleased to send to Mr. Banks, whose place of residence I do not know, this note, which I have sent open, that, if you please, you may read it.</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;When you send it, do not use your own seal.<br/>&lsquo;I am, Sir,</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;Your most humble servant,<br/>&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Feb. 27, 1772.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To JOSEPH BANKS, ESQ.</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;Perpetua ambitâ his terrá præmia lactis<br/>Hac habet altrici Capra secunda Jovis.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I return thanks to you and to Dr. Solander for the pleasure which I received in yesterday&rsquo;s conversation. I could not recollect a motto for your Goat, but have given her one. You, Sir, may perhaps have an epick poem from some happier pen than, Sir,</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;Your most humble servant,<br/>&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;Johnson&rsquo;s-court, Fleet-street,<br/>February 27, 1772.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To DR. JOHNSON.</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">&lsquo;MY DEAR SIR,</span></p>
<p class="p21">&lsquo;It is hard that I cannot prevail on you to write to me oftener. But I am convinced that it is in vain to expect from you a private correspondence with any regularity. I must, therefore, look upon you as a fountain of wisdom, from whence few rills are communicated to a distance, and which must be approached at its source, to partake fully of its virtues.</p>
<p class="p10">* * * * *</p>
<p class="p21">&lsquo;I am coming to London soon, and am to appear in an appeal from the Court of Session in the House of Lords. A schoolmaster in Scotland was, by a court of inferiour jurisdiction, deprived of his office, for being somewhat severe in the chastisement of his scholars. The Court of Session, considering it to be dangerous to the interest of learning and education, to lessen the dignity of teachers, and make them afraid of too indulgent parents, instigated by the complaints of their children, restored him. His enemies have appealed to the House of Lords, though the salary is only twenty pounds a year. I was Counsel for him here. I hope there will be little fear of a reversal; but I must beg to have your aid in my plan of supporting the decree. It is a general question, and not a point of particular law.</p>
<p class="p10">* * * * *</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;I am, &amp;c.,<br/>&lsquo;JAMES BOSWELL.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;To JAMES BOSWELL, ESQ.<br/>&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;That you are coming so soon to town I am very glad; and still more glad that you are coming as an advocate. I think nothing more likely to make your life pass happily away, than that consciousness of your own value, which eminence in your profession will certainly confer. If I can give you any collateral help, I hope you do not suspect that it will be wanting. My kindness for you has neither the merit of singular virtue, nor the reproach of singular prejudice. Whether to love you be right or wrong, I have many on my side: Mrs. Thrale loves you, and Mrs. Williams loves you, and what would have inclined me to love you, if I had been neutral before, you are a great favourite of Dr. Beattie.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Of Dr. Beattie I should have thought much, but that his lady puts him out of my head; she is a very lovely woman.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The ejection which you come hither to oppose, appears very cruel, unreasonable, and oppressive. I should think there could not be much doubt of your success.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;My health grows better, yet I am not fully recovered. I believe it is held, that men do not recover very fast after threescore. I hope yet to see Beattie&rsquo;s College: and have not given up the western voyage. But however all this may be or not, let us try to make each other happy when we meet, and not refer our pleasure to distant times or distant places.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;How comes it that you tell me nothing of your lady? I hope to see her some time, and till then shall be glad to hear of her.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am, dear Sir, &amp;c.</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;March 15, 1772.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To BENNET LANGTON, ESQ., NEAR SPILSBY, LINCOLNSHIRE.</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I congratulate you and Lady Rothes on your little man, and hope you will all be many years happy together.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Poor Miss Langton can have little part in the joy of her family. She this day called her aunt Langton to receive the sacrament with her; and made me talk yesterday on such subjects as suit her condition. It will probably be her <span class="t8">viaticum</span>. I surely need not mention again that she wishes to see her mother. I am, Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your most humble servant,</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;March 14, 1772.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On the 21st of March, I was happy to find myself again in my friend&rsquo;s study, and was glad to see my old acquaintance, Mr. Francis Barber, who was now returned home. Dr. Johnson received me with a hearty welcome; saying, &lsquo;I am glad you are come, and glad you are come upon such an errand:&rsquo; (alluding to the cause of the schoolmaster.) BOSWELL. &lsquo;I hope, Sir, he will be in no danger. It is a very delicate matter to interfere between a master and his scholars: nor do I see how you can fix the degree of severity that a master may use.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, till you can fix the degree of obstinacy and negligence of the scholars, you cannot fix the degree of severity of the master. Severity must be continued until obstinacy be subdued, and negligence be cured.&rsquo; He mentioned the severity of Hunter, his own Master. &lsquo;Sir, (said I,) Hunter is a Scotch name: so it should seem this schoolmaster who beat you so severely was a Scotchman. I can now account for your prejudice against the Scotch.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, he was not Scotch; and abating his brutality, he was a very good master.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">We talked of his two political pamphlets, <span class="t8">The False Alarm</span>, and <span class="t8">Thoughts concerning Falkland&rsquo;s Islands</span>. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Well, Sir, which of them did you think the best?&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;I liked the second best.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, I liked the first best; and Beattie liked the first best. Sir, there is a subtlety of disquisition in the first, that is worth all the fire of the second.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Pray, Sir, is it true that Lord North paid you a visit, and that you got two hundred a year in addition to your pension?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;No, Sir. Except what I had from the bookseller, I did not get a farthing by them. And, between you and me, I believe Lord North is no friend to me.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;How so, Sir?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, you cannot account for the fancies of men. Well, how does Lord Elibank? and how does Lord Monboddo?&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Very well, Sir. Lord Monboddo still maintains the superiority of the savage life.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;What strange narrowness of mind now is that, to think the things we have not known, are better than the things which we have known.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Why, Sir, that is a common prejudice.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Yes, Sir, but a common prejudice should not be found in one whose trade it is to rectify errour.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">A gentleman having come in who was to go as a mate in the ship along with Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander, Dr. Johnson asked what were the names of the ships destined for the expedition. The gentleman answered, they were once to be called the Drake and the Ralegh, but now they were to be called the Resolution and the Adventure. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Much better; for had the Ralegh returned without going round the world, it would have been ridiculous. To give them the names of the Drake and the Ralegh was laying a trap for satire.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Had not you some desire to go upon this expedition, Sir?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why yes, but I soon laid it aside. Sir, there is very little of intellectual, in the course. Besides, I see but at a small distance. So it was not worth my while to go to see birds fly, which I should not have seen fly; and fishes swim, which I should not have seen swim.&rsquo;</p>
