		<h1>MathJax</h1>
		<h2>What happen when you insert math formula in markdown.</h2>
		<p>
            There is no such thing as "LaTeX in markdown". Most of the markdown previewers use MathJax or katex.
            I don't like MathJax. The default font it use is not good.
        </p>
        <p><b>MathJax is not TeX.</b></p>

		<h2>Employ MathJax in your website</h2>
		<p>Just read the document of MathJax. Note that MathJax version 2 support different fonts while version 3 does
			not. If you are willing to change the font, you should check the documentation of MathJax version 2.</p>

		<h2>Change the font in your website</h2>
		<p>Note that there is actually three ways to render your formula:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>CHTML</li>
			<li>HTML+CSS</li>
			<li>SVG</li>
		</ol>
		<p>where CHTML only supports one font. You may change the configuration to HTML+CSS or SVG if you want to change
			the font.
			The configuration is determined based on your source. Anyway, you may read the source code on current
			website for a check. After you change the configuration, read the documentation of MathJax font to change
			the configuration of SVG or HTML+CSS to display your preferred font.</p>
        <p>Two Steps: 1. Change the rendering methods to SVG or the other; 2. Configure the font that SVG use.</p>
		<p>There are four kinds of fonts available. </p>
		<ol>
			<li>TeX, which is ugly under certain circumstances. </li>
			<li>STIX, which is ugly under most of the circumstances.</li>
			<li>Asana-Math, which is ugly under most of the circumstances, just like STIX.</li>
			<li>Neo-Euler, which is pretty cool because you rarely see it, and Knuth use this font in his book
				<i>Concrete Mathematics</i></li>
			<li>Latin-Modern, which is preferred since it suits CMU serif font best, but looks not so good because of
				SVG rendering.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Here is some test in-line formula: \( a = b \), \(\sum_{n=1} ^{\infty} a_n\). The following is displayed
			formula:</p>
		\[ G/\ker f \cong \text{Im}\, f\]
		<p>where \(f \) is a homomorphism from \(G \) to \(G'\).</p>
		<p>Hey, do you know that we can actually write <code>\ker</code> to display \(\ker\)</p>

		<h2>The spacing between lines</h2>
		<p>It is true that the spacing between will be effected if you employ a math formula with an unusual height. For
			example, \(g ^2\) is a very simple formula. However the spacing is slightly bigger. I shall insert some test
			text to help you notice. It is true that what we often consider is true is not true under certain
			circumstances where the consideration is not truly reliable for something that is out of the consideration
			which cause that the thing is considered to true is not true.</p>
		<p>Note: The spacing may be fine on some devices.</p>
		<p>To advoid the bad spacing we shall adjust the size of the superscript in this scenario. You can use
			<code>\scriptscriptstyle</code> to produce a smaller superscript. For example, \(g^{\scriptscriptstyle 2}\).
			Maybe one should avoid writing long article when using MathJax. </p>
