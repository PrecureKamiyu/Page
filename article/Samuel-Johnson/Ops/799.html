<p class="p21">This tragedy, which was to be Johnson&rsquo;s only play, was written between 1726 and 1749 and was considered by the author to be his greatest failure. First performed on 6 February 1749 in a production by his friend and former pupil, David Garrick, the play was a commercial success and earned Johnson more money than anything else he had written up to that point. It was never revived during his lifetime and there is no subsequent evidence of any other full-scale productions of <span class="t8">Irene</span> anywhere until 1999.</p>
<p class="p22">Johnson began writing the tragedy in his father&rsquo;s bookshop, at a time when he had befriended Gilbert Walmesley, the Registrar of the Ecclesiastical Court of Lichfield. Johnson would discuss <span class="t8">Irene</span> with Walmesley, reading him some of the early drafts. At one point, Walmesley told Johnson that &ldquo;he was making Irene suffer so much in the first part of the play that there would be nothing left for her to suffer in the later part&rdquo;. Johnson joked that there was &ldquo;enough in reserve... I intend to put my heroine into the ecclesiastical court of Lichfield which will fill up the utmost measure of human calamity&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="p22">Johnson next wrote a considerable part of the play while teaching at Edial Hall, his own established boarding school, in 1737.&nbsp; On one occasion David Garrick, Johnson&rsquo;s student, performed a skit mocking the play. However, <span class="t8">Irene</span> was completed mostly at Mrs. Johnson&rsquo;s urging, as she was fond of the story and hoped it would be a success. Her belief in the play inspired Johnson to finish the work and push to have it performed. When Edial Hall failed, Johnson travelled to London and brought the unfinished manuscript with him. He tried to submit <span class="t8">Irene</span> to Charles Fleetwood, the owner-manager of the Theatre Royal Drury Lane, but Fleetwood rejected it on the grounds that there was no patron and his theatre was catering to other types of performances. Johnson tried in 1741 to have the play printed, but this too failed. He seems to have continued to revise it over the next several years, since a manuscript notebook contains draft material made not earlier than June 1746. It was not until Garrick took over as manager of Drury Lane Theatre that the play was guaranteed a production. By this time Johnson was hard at work on his Dictionary, but he found time for further revision work on <span class="t8">Irene.</span></p>
<p class="p22">Johnson&rsquo;s main source for the play was Richard Knolles&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Generall Historie of the Turkes</span> (1603), which tells how the Sultan Mahomet conquers Constantinople in 1453 and captures a Greek Christian named Irene. He decides to take her as his mistress and while pursuing her romantically he ignores his duties as a monarch. Soon, the kingdom is falling apart from neglect and the subjects begin to riot, so Mahomet kills Irene to prove his dedication to his people. Johnson alters the story to emphasise the theme of Irene&rsquo;s temptation. His Mahomet offers Irene a troubling arrangement: if she becomes a Muslim, he will preserve her life and give her power at his court.</p>
