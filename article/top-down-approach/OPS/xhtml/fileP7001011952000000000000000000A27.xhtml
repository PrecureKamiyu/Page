Although these applications were (and continue to be) extremely useful, the Internet was essentially unknown outside of the academic and research communities. Then, in the early 1990s, a major new application arrived on the scene—the World Wide Web <a class="biblioref" href="fileP70010119520000000000000000037E0.xhtml#P7001011952000000000000000003835" data-foobar="7">[Berners-Lee 1994]</a>. The Web was the first Internet application that caught the general public’s eye. It dramatically changed, and continues to change, how people interact inside and outside their work environments. It elevated the Internet from just one of many data networks to essentially the one and only data network.</p>

Users receive what they want, when they want it. This is unlike traditional broadcast radio and television, which force users to tune in when the content provider makes the content available. In addition to being available on demand, the Web has many other wonderful features that people love and cherish. It is enormously easy for any individual to make information available over the Web—everyone can become a publisher at extremely low cost. Hyperlinks and search engines help us navigate through an ocean of information. Photos and videos stimulate our senses. Forms, JavaScript, Java applets, and many other devices enable us to interact with pages and sites. And the Web and its protocols serve as a platform for YouTube, Web-based e-mail (such as Gmail), and most mobile Internet applications, including Instagram and Google Maps.</p>

HTTP is implemented in two programs: a client program and a server program. The client program and server program, executing on different end systems, talk to each other by exchanging HTTP messages. HTTP defines the structure of these messages and how the client and server exchange the messages. Before explaining HTTP in detail, we should review some Web terminology.</p>

Once the client sends a message into its socket interface, the message is out of the client’s hands and is “in the hands” of TCP. Recall from <a class="xref" href="fileP7001011952000000000000000000974.xhtml#P7001011952000000000000000000974" data-foobar="7"><span class="label">Section</span> <span class="number">2.1</span></a> that TCP provides a reliable data transfer service to HTTP. This implies that each HTTP request message sent by a client process eventually arrives intact at the server; similarly, each HTTP response message sent by the server process eventually arrives intact at the client. Here we see one of the great advantages of a layered architecture—HTTP need not worry about lost data or the details of how TCP recovers from loss or reordering of data within the network. That is the job of TCP and the protocols in the lower layers of the protocol stack.</p>
<p id="P7001011952000000000000000009B3A" data-uri="M02_KURO4140_07_SE_C02.xhtml#P7001011952000000000000000009B3A">It is important to note that the server sends requested files to clients without storing any state information about the client. If a particular client asks for the same object twice in a period of a few seconds, the server does not respond by saying that it just served the object to the client; instead, the server resends the object, as it has completely forgotten what it did earlier. Because an HTTP server maintains no information about the clients, HTTP is said to be a <span class="keyword" id="P7001011952000000000000000000A47" data-uri="M02_KURO4140_07_SE_C02.xhtml#P7001011952000000000000000000A47"><b>stateless protocol</b></span>.

Depending on the application and on how the application is being used, the series of requests may be made back-to-back, periodically at regular intervals, or intermittently. When this client-server interaction is taking place over TCP, the application developer needs to make an important decision—should each request/response pair be sent over a <i>separate</i> TCP connection, or should all of the requests and their corresponding responses be sent over the <i>same</i> TCP connection? In the former approach, the application is said to use <span class="keyword" id="P7001011952000000000000000000A4B" data-uri="M02_KURO4140_07_SE_C02.xhtml#P7001011952000000000000000000A4B"><b>non-persistent connections</b></span>; and in the latter approach, <span class="keyword" id="P7001011952000000000000000000A4C" data-uri="M02_KURO4140_07_SE_C02.xhtml#P7001011952000000000000000000A4C"><b>persistent connections</b></span>. To gain a deep understanding of this design issue, let’s examine the advantages and disadvantages of persistent connections in the context of a specific application, namely, HTTP, which can use both non-persistent connections and persistent connections. Although HTTP uses persistent connections in its default mode, HTTP clients and servers can be configured to use non-persistent connections instead.</p>

Two different browsers may interpret (that is, display to the user) a Web page in somewhat different ways. HTTP has nothing to do with how a Web page is interpreted by a client.

Note that each TCP connection transports exactly one request message and one response message. Thus, in this example, when a user requests the Web page, 11 TCP connections are generated.</p>

Indeed, users can configure modern browsers to control the degree of parallelism. In their default modes, most browsers open 5 to 10 parallel TCP connections, and each of these connections handles one request-response transaction. If the user prefers, the maximum number of parallel connections <span class="pagebreak" title="102" id="P7001011952000000000000000000A67" data-uri="M02_KURO4140_07_SE_C02.xhtml#P7001011952000000000000000000A67" epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>can be set to one, in which case the 10 connections are established serially.

First, a brand-new connection must be established and maintained for <i>each requested object</i>. For each of these connections, TCP buffers must be allocated and TCP variables must be kept in both the client and server. This can place a significant burden on the Web server, which may be serving requests from hundreds of different clients simultaneously. Second, as we just described, each object suffers a delivery delay of two RTTs—one RTT to establish the TCP connection and one RTT to request and receive an object.</p>

Subsequent requests and responses between the same client and server can be sent over the same connection. In particular, an entire Web page (in the example above, the base HTML file and the 10 images) can be sent over a single persistent TCP connection. Moreover, multiple Web pages residing on the same server can be sent from the server to the same client over a single persistent TCP connection. These requests for objects can be made back-to-back, without waiting for replies to pending requests (pipelining). Typically, the HTTP server closes a connection when it isn’t used for a certain time (a configurable timeout interval). When the server receives the back-to-back requests, it sends the objects back-to-back. The default mode of HTTP uses persistent connections with pipelining. Most recently, HTTP/2 <a class="biblioref" href="fileP70010119520000000000000000037E0.xhtml#P7001011952000000000000000003BC9" data-foobar="7">[RFC 7540]</a> builds on HTTP 1.1 by allowing multiple requests and replies to be interleaved in the <i>same</i> connection, and a mechanism for prioritizing HTTP message requests and replies within this connection.

By including the <code id="P7001011952000000000000000009B6D" data-uri="M02_KURO4140_07_SE_C02.xhtml#P7001011952000000000000000009B6D">Connection: close</code> header line, the browser is telling the server that it doesn’t want to bother with persistent connections; it wants the server to close the connection after sending the requested object. The <code id="P7001011952000000000000000009B6E" data-uri="M02_KURO4140_07_SE_C02.xhtml#P7001011952000000000000000009B6E">User-agent:</code> header line specifies the user agent, that is, the browser type that is making the request to the server. Here the user agent is Mozilla/5.0, a Firefox browser. This header line is useful because the server can actually send different versions of the same object to different types of user agents. (Each of the versions is addressed by the same URL.) Finally, the <code id="P7001011952000000000000000009B6F" data-uri="M02_KURO4140_07_SE_C02.xhtml#P7001011952000000000000000009B6F">Accept-language:</code> header indicates that the user prefers to receive a French version of the object, if such an object exists on the server; otherwise, the server should send its default version. The <code id="P7001011952000000000000000009B70" data-uri="M02_KURO4140_07_SE_C02.xhtml#P7001011952000000000000000009B70">Accept-language:</code> header is just one of many content negotiation headers available in HTTP.</p>

You may have noticed, however, that after the header lines (and the additional carriage return and line feed) there is an “entity body.” The entity body is empty with the <code id="P7001011952000000000000000009B72" data-uri="M02_KURO4140_07_SE_C02.xhtml#P7001011952000000000000000009B72">GET</code> method, but is used with the <code id="P7001011952000000000000000009B73" data-uri="M02_KURO4140_07_SE_C02.xhtml#P7001011952000000000000000009B73">POST</code> method.

How does a Web server decide which header lines to include in a response message? A browser will generate header lines as a function of the browser type and version (for example, an HTTP/1.0 browser will not generate any 1.1 header lines), the user configuration of the browser (for example, preferred language), and whether the browser currently has a cached, but possibly out-of-date, version of the object. Web servers behave similarly: There are different products, versions, and configurations, all of which influence which header lines are included in response messages.</p>

This simplifies server design and has permitted engineers to develop high-performance Web servers that can handle thousands of simultaneous TCP connections. However, it is often desirable for a Web site to identify users, either because the server wishes to restrict user access or because it wants to serve content as a function of the user identity. For these purposes, HTTP uses cookies. Cookies, defined in <a class="biblioref" href="fileP70010119520000000000000000037E0.xhtml#P7001011952000000000000000003BBF" data-foobar="7">[RFC 6265]</a>, allow sites to keep track of users.

Suppose Susan, who always accesses the Web using Internet Explorer from her home PC, contacts <a class="ulink" href="http://Amazon.com">Amazon.com</a> for the first time. Let us suppose that in the past she has already visited the eBay site. When the request comes into the Amazon Web server, the server creates a unique identification number and creates an entry in its back-end database that is indexed by the identification number. The Amazon Web server then responds to Susan’s browser, including in the HTTP response a <code id="P7001011952000000000000000009BF5" data-uri="M02_KURO4140_07_SE_C02.xhtml#P7001011952000000000000000009BF5">Set-cookie:</code> header, which contains the identification number.

Amazon also recommends products to Susan based on Web pages she has visited at Amazon in the past.

The first time a user visits a site, the user can provide a user identification (possibly his or her name). During the subsequent sessions, the browser passes a cookie header to the server, thereby identifying the user to the server. Cookies can thus be used to create a user session layer on top of stateless HTTP. For example, when a user logs in to a Web-based e-mail application (such as Hotmail), the browser sends cookie information to the server, permitting the server to identify the user throughout the user’s session with the application.</p>

First, a Web cache can substantially reduce the response time for a client request, particularly if the bottleneck bandwidth between the client and the origin server is much less than the bottleneck bandwidth between the client and the cache. If there is a high-speed connection between the client and the cache, as there often is, and if the cache has the requested object, then the cache will be able to deliver the object rapidly to the client. Second, as we will soon illustrate with an example, Web caches can substantially reduce traffic on an institution’s access link to the Internet. By reducing traffic, the institution (for example, a company or a university) does not have to <span class="pagebreak" title="112" id="P7001011952000000000000000000B55" data-uri="M02_KURO4140_07_SE_C02.xhtml#P7001011952000000000000000000B55" epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>upgrade bandwidth as quickly, thereby reducing costs. Furthermore, Web caches can substantially reduce Web traffic in the Internet as a whole, thereby improving performance for all applications.</p>

A router in the institutional network and a router in the Internet are connected by a 15 Mbps link. The origin servers are attached to the Internet but are located all over the globe. Suppose that the average object size is 1 Mbits and that the average request rate from the institution’s browsers to the origin servers is 15 requests per second. Suppose that the HTTP request messages are negligibly small and thus create no traffic in the networks or in the access link (from institutional router to Internet router). Also suppose that the amount of time it takes from when the router on the Internet side of the access link in <a class="xref" href="#P7001011952000000000000000000B57" data-foobar="1"><span class="label">Figure</span> <span class="number">2.12</span></a> forwards an HTTP request (within an IP datagram) until it receives the response (typically within many IP datagrams) is two seconds on average.

However, as discussed in <a class="xref" href="fileP70010119520000000000000000005CD.xhtml#P700101195200000000000000000060D" data-foobar="7"><span class="label">Section</span> <span class="number">1.4.2</span></a>, as the traffic intensity approaches 1 (as is the case of the access link in <a class="xref" href="#P7001011952000000000000000000B57" data-foobar="1"><span class="label">Figure</span> <span class="number">2.12</span></a>), the delay on a link becomes very large and grows without bound. Thus, the average response time to satisfy requests is going to be on the order of minutes, if not more, which is unacceptable for the institution’s users. Clearly something must be done.</p>
<p id="P7001011952000000000000000009C28" data-uri="M02_KURO4140_07_SE_C02.xhtml#P7001011952000000000000000009C28">One possible solution is to increase the access rate from 15 Mbps to, say, 100 Mbps. This will lower the traffic intensity on the access link to 0.15, which translates to negligible delays between the two routers. In this case, the total response time will roughly be two seconds, that is, the Internet delay. But this solution also means that the institution must upgrade its access link from 15 Mbps to 100 Mbps, a costly proposition.</p>
<p id="P7001011952000000000000000009C29" data-uri="M02_KURO4140_07_SE_C02.xhtml#P7001011952000000000000000009C29">Now consider the alternative solution of not upgrading the access link but instead installing a Web cache in the institutional network. This solution is illustrated in <a class="xref" href="#P7001011952000000000000000000B68" data-foobar="1"><span class="label">Figure</span> <span class="number">2.13</span></a>. Hit rates—the fraction of requests that are satisfied by a cache— typically range from 0.2 to 0.7 in practice. For illustrative purposes, let’s suppose that the cache provides a hit rate of 0.4 for this institution. Because the clients and the cache are connected to the same high-speed LAN, 40 percent of the requests will be satisfied almost immediately, say, within 10 milliseconds, by the cache. Nevertheless, the remaining 60 percent of the requests still need to be satisfied by the origin servers. But with only 60 percent of the requested objects passing through the access link, the traffic intensity on the access link is reduced from 1.0 to 0.6. Typically, a traffic intensity less than 0.8 corresponds to a small delay, say, tens of milliseconds, on a 15 Mbps link. This delay is negligible compared with the two-second Internet delay. Given these considerations, average delay therefore is</p>

Since this object may have been modified at the Web server in the past week, the cache performs an up-to-date check by issuing a conditional GET. Specifically, the cache sends:</p>

We’ve seen the format of HTTP messages and the actions taken by the Web client and server as these messages are sent and received. We’ve also studied a bit of the Web’s application infrastructure, including caches, cookies, and back-end databases, all of which are tied in some way to the HTTP protocol.</p>
