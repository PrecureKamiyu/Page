As it turns out, there is another common interaction that arises, where one thread must wait for another to complete some action before it continues. This inter- action arises, for example, when a process performs a disk I/O and is put to sleep; when the I/O completes, the process needs to be roused from its slumber so it can continue.</p><p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Thus, in the coming chapters, we’ll be not only studying how to build support for synchronization primitives to support atomicity but also for mechanisms to support this type of sleeping/waking interaction that is common in multi-threaded programs. If this doesn’t make sense right now, that is OK! It will soon enough, when you read the chapter on <b>con- dition variables</b>. If it doesn’t by then, well, then it is less OK, and you should read that chapter again (and again) until it does make sense.</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part265.htm">&lt; 上一个</a><span> | </span><a href="../ostep.html">内容</a><span> | </span><a href="part267.htm">下一个 &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
