<h1>Great books</h1>
<ul>
    <li><em>Algebra: Chapter 0</em> by Paolo Allufi: The book can be used as a textbook of a course for graduate or under-graduate who want to improve themselves. Catergory is introduced in the first chapter. It is good, but requiring certain degree of mathematical maturity.</li>
	<li><em>Computer Organization and Architecture: Designing for Performance</em> by William Stallings: It is a book about the computer
	organization. It is worth noting that Tang's book has 借鉴了一下 this book. The basic structure is similar. And it
	it is clear that which book is more of value (as you can see, in Tang's book, there is a section about cache while
	there is a whole chapter to introduce cache in Stallings' book.)</li>
	<li>
        <em>Automata theory, Languages, and Computation</em>: Its language is simple. The author is like your friend. Things may not be enough. But they are comfortable to read. And here is the <a href="http://infolab.stanford.edu/~ullman/ialc.html"><b>link to the answer to the starred exercises</b></a> in the book. PS. You may buy a 影印版.
    </li>
	<li><em>线性代数</em> by 李炯生: The author tells you all the details patiently. And the exercises are very
		interesting (and extremely <b>difficult</b>).</li>
	<li><em>Computer Organization and Design The Hardware Software Interface [RISC-V Edition]</em> by David A.
		Patterson, John L. Hennessy: It is not that good actually. A classic American textbook. Lots of
		gobblers. But <em>Computer Organization</em> itself is very interesting. Thus it may be the finest book
		so far.</li>
	<li><em>近世代数引论</em> by 冯克勤: A book with less examples. But it tells things rigorously (not that rigorously,
		but very good enough). Similarly, the exercises are very interesting (and extremely hard).</li>
</ul>

<h1>Daily</h1>
<p>
    <b>Scheme in Emacs</b>: If you want to run scheme code in Emacs, you will maybe try out the built-in Emacs shell to run the scheme interpreter. But you may also try to use <code>xscheme</code> to enable some fancy features. You can open a scheme interaction buffer just it work just like lisp interaction buffer. You should note that <code>xscheme</code> is for <b>MIT Scheme</b> which is to say that you can use it while learning <b>SICP</b>.
    <br>
    Usage: you should use <code>M-x load-library</code> to load the <code>xscheme</code> libray. And then start the scheme by <code>M-x start-scheme</code>

<h1>What I did <time datetime="2023-04-27">today</time>(2023-04-27)</h1>
<p>Well, it is said that one should write down what they thought during something like a project or
	something more than just a project. Ok, it may be true, but is the sentence saying what I am saying?
	What I mean is that, crap, there is nothing worth writing down because that only happens when one is
	experiencing a project (or a lab if you want to call it that name) with quality.</p>
<p>Man, you know what I am saying. Shit! What I want to say is shit! It is pointless, indeed pointless
	to note down shitty stuff. SHIT.</p>
<p>I finished java exam. You know what I want to say. SHIT. PIECE OF SHIT. One has failed his slogan.
</p>

<h1>What I did <time datetime="2023-04-26">today</time>(2023-04-26)</h1>
<p>はるですね。</p>

<h1>What I did <time datetime="2023-04-22">today</time>(2023-04-22)</h1>
<p>I slept at 5:00 am yesterday. I felt extremely good. So quiet. No noise. Like in heaven.</p>

<h1>What I did <time datetime="2023-04-21">today</time>(2023-04-21)</h1>
<p>I shall introduce a concept called <em>nested snippets</em>. When you employ another snippet inside
	of one snippet, the cursor should jump normally, that is to say, the inner snippet shall not cancel
	the <em>jump</em> of the outer snippet. The snippet plugin called <em>hypersnips</em> has the exact
	problem. Bad. And it is better to use different key for <em>jump</em> and <em>span</em>, or one
	can't use inner snippets at the first place.</p>
<p>I finished experiment. 真他妈傻逼 我操.</p>


<h1>What I did <time datetime="2023-04-20">today</time>(2023-04-20)</h1>
<p>I just figured that this title is better. The previous one is a question, but this one is a noun
	phrase. More like a title.</p>
<p>Anyway, I proceeded to learning Java Shit. Indeed shit. With no doubt. Absolute shit.</p>
<h1><code>Org</code> and Emacs</h1>
<p><code>Org mode</code> is very interesting. You can appoint the style sheet that will be used by the
	exported html file. To do this, you shall use the following code in your <code>file</code></p>
<pre class="example">
#+HTML_HEAD: &lt;link rel = "stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css"/&gt;
#+OPTIONS: html-style:nil</pre>
<p>The first sentence tells Emacs to include the code in the head of the <code>html</code> file. The
	second sentence tells Emacs to disable the default style sheet.</p>

<p>And it is very simple to add <code>yasnippets</code> snippets since the plugin has already provided
	us with some useful keybindings to create snippets and try out snippets. And it is especially
	convenient compared to the <code>Ultisnips</code> in Vim. You can quickly insert a snippet and then
	go back to work with no pressure. The snippets source is automatically renewed (Okay, so is
	<code>Ultisnips</code>). Anyway, since that the installation of the plugins in Emacs is much easier
	(unless you are not in China), and since that the <code>M-x</code> can easily list numbers of the
	available commands and variables, I think Emacs is, in this scenario, more convient than Vim. Mostly
	because the plugin experience is much better (Of
	course, that is because of the Wall).
</p>
<p>I don't know which editor is better, for real. One may think that there are a lot of useful features
	in Emacs, while one may think that Emacs is like a shit mountain, with a ton of useless things.</p>
<h2>The experiment</h2>
<p>The shitty experiment is half-done rightnow. Holy shit! But I forgot to write the homework of
	automata theory(To be honest, I am not that willing to call "it" <b>automata theory</b>. Only the
	shameless calls it "theory".</p>

<h1>What did I do <time datetime="2023-04-19">today</time>(2023-04-19)?</h1>
<p>Literally nothing...Man! People do nothing everyday.</p>
<p>Hey I learnt some cool stuffs about the <code>org mode</code>. It is so cool. Do you know that
	MathJax is employed by default when you export the org mode file to html file? Insane. Highly
	productive! Emacs should introduce a Vim mode to edit file. I will never turn off Emacs if there
	were such thing.</p>
<p>Hey I just learned that you can check the help documentation of the current mode by pressing
	<code>C-h m</code>.
</p>
<p>Yet another paragraph. You should try using <code>yasnippets</code>. It would be better if I can find
	its documentation. And I become kinda insterested to the study of colors. Everybody knows that the
	color in WEP is great. But the questions is how to describe how good it is. On the other hand, after
	watching the ep.2 of U149, I realized that color is seldon mentioned.</p>

<h1>What did I do <time datetime="2023-04-18">today</time>(2023-04-18)?</h1>
<p>Literally nothing...</p>
<p>I wrote the note on <a href="art/note/j09.html" target="_blank">Chapter 09</a>. What a shame...</p>

<h1>What did I do <time datetime="2023-04-17">today</time>(2023-04-17)?</h1>
<p>Literally nothing.</p>
<p>I wrote three chapters of Java. They are shit, for sure. Here are the links to them.</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="art/note/j06.html">Chapter 06</a></li>
	<li><a href="art/note/j07.html">Chapter 07</a></li>
	<li><a href="art/note/j08.html">Chapter 08</a></li>
</ul>
<p>They are indeed piece of shit.
<p>Chapter 06 is about black box and white box testing. </p>
<p>Chapter 07 is about <code>Set</code> and <code>List</code> class in Java. And is about the
	<b>Strategy pattern</b> and <b>iterator pattern</b>.
</p>
<p>Chapter 08 is about <code>DAO</code> and file manipulations. We use <code>DAO</code> to manage the
	storation of the data. And we use file manipulation to implement the <code>DAO</code> using file
	system, to do which we need to know the manipulations on files. Lastly, we learnt
	<b>serialization</b>, we can use which to write objects to local files. When doing it, we shall use
	a list (you may call it container) to store those objects and write the container to the local file.
</p>
<p>And I have to say that <code>org mode</code> is not that pleasing. What a pile of shit. Hard to use.
	And the manual is like shit. Everybody knows that an enumeration is like shit, but the manual has
	only enumerations.</p>

<h1>What did I do <time datetime="2023-04-16">today</time>(2023-04-16)?</h1>
<p><b>Literally nothing</b>.</p>
<p>I finish doing some of homework. What a complete shit. What a waste of life. Shit.</p>
<p>Ok, I learned what is <b>Lagrange interpolation</b> and what is <b>Newton interpolation</b>. Okay
	that is all. MG.</p>

<h1>What did I do <time datetime="2023-04-15">today</time>(2023-04-15)?</h1>
<p>Literally nothing</p>
<p>But I read the first three episode of <b>金瓶梅</b>. <b>Ep</b>.3 is great. And I just learn what is an
	<b>auxiliary verb</b>. And I just installed a extension for web browser to employ vim keybinding in
	browser.
</p>

<h1>What did I do <time datetime="2023-04-14">today</time>?</h1>

<h2>I learned a little bit Japanese.</h2>
<p>I admit, linguistics is boring. I mean, to be honest, I don't care about the
	genetic affiliation of Japanese or anything about Old Japanese. </p>
