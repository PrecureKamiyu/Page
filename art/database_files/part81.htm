F. Codd of the <span class="s44">IBM </span>San Jose Research Laboratory proposed the relational model in the late 1960s ([Codd (1970)]). In that paper, Codd also introduced the original deﬁnition of relational algebra. This work led to the prestigious <span class="s44">ACM </span>Turing Award to Codd in 1981 ([Codd (1982)]).</p><p style="padding-left: 119pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: right;">After E. F. Codd introduced the relational model, an expansive theory developed around the relational model pertaining to schema design and the expressive power of various relational languages. Several classic texts cover relational database theory, in- cluding [Maier (1983)] (which is available free, online), and [Abiteboul et al. (1995)]. Codd’s original paper inspired several research projects that were formed in the mid to late 1970s with the goal of constructing practical relational database systems, including System R at the <span class="s44">IBM </span>San Jose Research Laboratory, Ingres at the University of California at Berkeley, and Query-by-Example at the <span class="s44">IBM </span>T. J. Watson Research</p><p style="padding-left: 119pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Center. The Oracle database was developed commercially at the same time.</p><p style="padding-left: 119pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">Many relational database products are now commercially available. These include <span class="s44">IBM</span>’s <span class="s44">DB2 </span>and Informix, Oracle, Microsoft <span class="s44">SQL </span>Server, and Sybase and <span class="s44">HANA </span>from <span class="s44">SAP</span>. Popular open-source relational database systems include <span class="s44">M</span>y<span class="s44">SQL </span>and <span class="s44">P</span>ostgre<span class="s44">SQL</span>. Hive and Spark are widely used systems that support parallel execution of queries across large numbers of computers.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part80.htm">&lt; 上一个</a><span> | </span><a href="../database.html">内容</a><span> | </span><a href="part82.htm">下一个 &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
