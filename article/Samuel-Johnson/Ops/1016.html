<h2 class="h20"><a id="a2684"></a>Preface</h2>
<p class="p21">In making this abridgement of Boswell&rsquo;s Life of Johnson I have omitted most of Boswell&rsquo;s criticisms, comments, and notes, all of Johnson&rsquo;s opinions in legal cases, most of the letters, and parts of the conversation dealing with matters which were of greater importance in Boswell&rsquo;s day than now. I have kept in mind an old habit, common enough, I dare say, among its devotees, of opening the book of random, and reading wherever the eye falls upon a passage of especial interest. All such passages, I hope, have been retained, and enough of the whole book to illustrate all the phases of Johnson&rsquo;s mind and of his time which Boswell observed.</p>
<p class="p24">Loyal Johnsonians may look upon such a book with a measure of scorn. I could not have made it, had I not believed that it would be the means of drawing new readers to Boswell, and eventually of finding for them in the complete work what many have already found &mdash; days and years of growing enlightenment and happy companionship, and an innocent refuge from the cares and perturbations of life.</p>
