Updates would consist mostly of appends in such applications. Another class of applications that are likely to beneﬁt area those that involve multiple cooperating parties, who trust each other to some extent, but not fully, and desire to have a shared record of transactions that are digitally signed, and are kept safe from tampering. In this latter case, the cooperating parties could include the general public.</p><p class="s66" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 344pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">26.8 <span style=" color: #00AEEF;">Emerging Applications  </span><span class="s164">1277</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 119pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">Below, we provide a list of several application domains along with a short explana- tion of the value provided by a blockchain implementation of the application. In some cases, the value added by a blockchain is a novel capability; in others, the value added is the ability to do something that could have been done previously only at prohibitive cost.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 139pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s39">• </span><b>Academic certiﬁcates and transcripts: </b>Universities can put student certiﬁcates and transcripts on a public blockchain secured by the student’s public key and signed digitally by the university. Only the student can read the records, but the student can then authorize access to those records. As a result, students can obtain cer- tiﬁcates and transcripts for future study or for prospective employers in a secure manner from a public source. This approach was prototyped by <span class="s44">MIT </span>in 2017.</p><p class="s39" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 139pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: justify;">• <span class="s46">Accounting and audit: </span><span class="p">Double-entry bookkeeping is a fundamental principle of accounting that helps ensure accurate and auditable records. A similar beneﬁt can be gained from cryptographically signed blockchain entries in a digital distributed ledger. In particular, the use of a blockchain ensures that the ledger is tamperproof, even against insider attacks and hackers who may gain control of the database. Also, if the enterprise’s auditor is a participant, then ledger entries can become visible immediately to auditors, enabling a continuous rather than periodic audit.</span></p><p class="s39" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 139pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: justify;">• <span class="s46">Asset management: </span><span class="p">Tracking ownership records on a blockchain enables veriﬁable access to ownership records and secure, signed updates. As an example, real-estate ownership records, a matter of public record, could be made accessible to the public on a blockchain, while updates to those records could be made only by transactions signed by the parties to the transaction. A similar approach can be applied to ownership of ﬁnancial assets such as stocks and bonds. While stock exchanges manage trading of stocks and bonds, long term records are kept by depositories that users must trust. Blockchain can help track such assets without having to trust a depository.</span></p><p class="s39" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 139pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: justify;">• <span class="s46">E-government: </span><span class="p">A single government blockchain would eliminate agency dupli- cation of records and create a common, authoritative information source. A highly notable user of this approach is the government of Estonia, which uses its blockchain for taxation, voting, health, and an innovative “e-Residency” program.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 139pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s39">• </span><b>Foreign-currency exchange: </b>International ﬁnancial transactions are often slow and costly. Use of an intermediary cryptocurrency can enable blockchain-based foreign-currency exchange at a relative rapid pace with full, irrefutable traceabil- ity. Ripple is oﬀering such capability using the <span class="s44">XRP </span>currency.</p><p class="s39" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 139pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: justify;">• <span class="s46">Health care: </span><span class="p">Health records are notorious for their nonavailability across health- care providers, their inconsistency, and their inaccuracy even with the increased use of electronic health records. Data are added from a large number of sources and the provenance of materials used may not be well documented (see discussion of supply chains below). A uniﬁed blockchain is suitable for distributed update,</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 107pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">and cryptographic data protection, unlockable by the patient’s private key, would enable access to a patient’s full health record anytime, anywhere in an emergency. The actual records may be kept oﬀchain, but the blockchain acts as the trusted mechanism for accessing the data.</p><p class="s39" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 107pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: justify;">• <span class="s46">Insurance claims: </span><span class="p">The processing of insurance claims is a complex workﬂow of data from the scene of the claim, various contractors involved in repairs, statements from witnesses, etc. A blockchain’s ability to capture data from many sources and distribute it rapidly, accurately, and securely, promises eﬃciency and accu- racy gains in the insurance industry.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 107pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s39">• </span><b>Internet of things: </b>The Internet of Things (<span class="s44">IoT</span>) is a term that refers to systems of many interacting devices (“things”), including within smart buildings, smart cities, self-monitoring civil infrastructure, and so on. These devices could act as nodes that can pass blockchain transactions into the network without having to ensure the transmission of data reaches a central server. In the late 2010s, research is underway to see if this data-collection approach can be eﬀective in lowering costs and increasing performance. Adding so many entries to a blockchain in a short period of time may suggest a replacement of the chain data structure with a directed, acyclic graph. The Iota blockchain is an example of one such system, where the graph structure is called a <i>tangle</i>.</p><p class="s39" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 107pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: justify;">• <span class="s46">Loyalty programs and aggregation of transactions: </span><span class="p">There are a variety of situa- tions where a customer or user makes multiple purchases from the same vendor, such as within a theme park, inside a video game, or from a large online retailer. These vendors could create internal cryptocurrencies in a proprietary, permis- sioned blockchain, with currency value pegged to a ﬁat currency like the dollar. The vendor gains by replacing credit-card transactions with vendor-internal trans- actions. This saves credit-card fees and allows the vendor to capture more of the valuable customer data coming from these transactions. The same concept can apply to retail loyalty points, exempliﬁed by airline frequent-ﬂyer miles. It is costly for vendors to maintain these systems and coordinate with partner vendors in the program. A blockchain-based system allows the hosting vendor to distribute the workload among the partners and allows transactions to be posted in a decentral- ized manner, releaving the vendor from have to run its own online transaction processing system. In the late 2010s, business strategies were being tested around these concepts.</span></p><p class="s39" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 107pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: justify;">• <span class="s46">Supply chain: </span><span class="p">Blockchain enables every participant in a supply chain to log every action. This facilitates tracking the movement of every item in the chain rather than only aggregates like crates, shipments, etc. In the event of a recall, the set of aﬀected products can be pinpointed to a smaller set of products and done so quickly. When a quality issue suggests a recall, some supply-chain members may be tempted to cover up their role, but the immutability of the blockchain prevents record falsiﬁcation after the fact.</span></p><p class="s66" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 119pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;"><a name="bookmark569">26.9 </a><span style=" color: #00AEEF;">Summary  </span><span class="s164">1279</span><a name="bookmark599">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 139pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s39">• </span><b>Tickets for events: </b>Suppose a person <i>A </i>has bought tickets for an event, but now wishes to sell them, and <i>B </i>buys the ticket from <i>A</i>. Given that tickets are all sold online, <i>B </i>would need to trust that the ticket given by <i>A </i>is genuine, and <i>A </i>has not already sold the ticket, that is, the ticket has not been double-spent. If ticket trans- actions are carried out on a blockchain, double-spending can be detected easily. Tickets can be veriﬁed if they are signed digitally by the event organizer (whether or not they are on a blockchain).</p><p class="s39" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 139pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: justify;">• <span class="s46">Trade ﬁnance: </span><span class="p">Companies often depend on loans from banks, issued through let- ters of credits, to ﬁnance purchases. Such letters of credit are issued against goods based on bills of lading indicating that the goods are ready for shipment. The ownership of the goods (title) is then transferred to the buyer. These transactions involve multiple parties including the seller, buyer, the buyer’s bank, the seller’s bank, a shipping company and so forth, which trust each other to some extent, but not fully. Traditionally, these processes were based on physical documents that have to be signed and shipped between parties that may be anywhere on the globe, resulting in signiﬁcant delays in these processes. Blockchain technology can be used to keep these documents in a digital form, and automate these processes in a way that is highly secure yet very fast (at least compared to processing of physical documents).</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Other applications beyond those we have listed continue to emerge.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part468.htm">&lt; 上一个</a><span> | </span><a href="../database.html">内容</a><span> | </span><a href="part470.htm">下一个 &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
