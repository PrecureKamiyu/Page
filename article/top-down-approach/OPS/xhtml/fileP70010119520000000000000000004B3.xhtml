We are now going to delve a bit more deeply into the components of a computer network (and the Internet, in particular). We begin in this section at the edge of a network and look at the components with which we are most ­familiar—namely, the computers, smartphones and other devices that we use on a daily basis. In the next section we’ll move from the network edge to the network core and examine switching and routing in computer networks.</p>

They are referred to as end systems because they sit at the edge of the Internet, as shown in <a class="xref" href="#P70010119520000000000000000004B9" data-foobar="1"><span class="label">Figure</span> <span class="number">1.3</span></a>. The Internet’s end systems include desktop computers (e.g., desktop PCs, Macs, and Linux boxes), servers (e.g., Web and e-mail servers), and mobile devices (e.g., laptops, smartphones, and tablets). Furthermore, an increasing number of non-traditional “things” are being attached to the Internet as end ­systems (see the Case History feature).</p>

A world in which most people, cars, bicycles, eye glasses, watches, toys, hospital equipment, home sensors, classrooms, video surveillance systems, atmospheric sensors, store-shelf products, and pets are connected? This world of the Internet of Things (IoT) may actually be just around the corner.</p>

These things include our smartphones, which already follow us around in our homes, offices, and cars, reporting our geo-locations and usage data to our ISPs and Internet applications. But in addition to our smartphones, a wide-variety of non-traditional “things” are already available as products. For example, there are Internet-connected wearables, including watches (from Apple and many others) and eye glasses. Internet-connected glasses can, for example, upload everything we see to the cloud, allowing us to share our visual experiences with people around the world in real-time. There are Internet-connected things already available for the smart home, including Internet-connected thermostats that can be controlled remotely from our smartphones, and Internet-connected body scales, enabling us to graphically review the progress of our diets from our smartphones. There are Internet-connected toys, including dolls that recognize and interpret a child’s speech and respond appropriately.</p>

But at the same time there are also huge security and privacy risks. For example, attackers, via the Internet, might be able to hack into IoT devices or into the servers collecting data from IoT devices. For example, an attacker could hijack an Internet-connected doll and talk directly with a child; or an attacker could hack into a database that stores ­personal health and activity information collected from wearable devices. These security and privacy concerns could undermine the consumer confidence necessary for the ­technologies to meet their full potential and may result in less widespread adoption <a class="biblioref" href="fileP70010119520000000000000000037E0.xhtml#P7001011952000000000000000003917" data-foobar="7">[FTC 2015]</a>.</p>

As with a DSL modem, the cable modem is typically an external device and connects to the home PC through an Ethernet port. (We will discuss Ethernet in great detail in <a class="xref" href="fileP70010119520000000000000000023B1.xhtml#P70010119520000000000000000023B1" data-foobar="7"><span class="label">Chapter</span> <span class="number">6</span></a>.) At the cable head end, the cable modem termination system (CMTS) serves a similar function as the DSL network’s DSLAM—turning the analog signal sent from the cable modems in many downstream homes back into digital format. Cable modems divide the HFC network into two channels, a downstream and an upstream channel. As with DSL, access is typically asymmetric, with the downstream channel typically allocated a higher transmission rate than the upstream channel. The ­DOCSIS 2.0 standard defines downstream rates up to 42.8 Mbps and upstream rates of up to 30.7 Mbps. As in the case of DSL networks, the maximum achievable rate may not be realized due to lower contracted data rates or media impairments.</p>
<p id="P7001011952000000000000000009783" data-uri="M01_KURO4140_07_SE_C01.xhtml#P7001011952000000000000000009783">One important characteristic of cable Internet access is that it is a shared broadcast medium. In particular, every packet sent by the head end travels downstream on every link to every home and every packet sent by a home travels on the upstream channel to the head end. For this reason, if several users are simultaneously downloading a video file on the downstream channel, the actual rate at which each user receives its video file will be significantly lower than the aggregate cable downstream rate. On the other hand, if there are only a few active users and they are all Web surfing, then each of the users may actually receive Web pages at the full cable downstream rate, because the users will rarely request a Web page at exactly the same time. Because the upstream channel is also shared, a distributed multiple access protocol is needed to coordinate transmissions and avoid collisions. (We’ll discuss this collision issue in some detail in <a class="xref" href="fileP70010119520000000000000000023B1.xhtml#P70010119520000000000000000023B1" data-foobar="7"><span class="label">Chapter</span> <span class="number">6</span></a>.)</p>

The simplest optical distribution network is called direct fiber, with one fiber leaving the CO for each home. More commonly, each fiber leaving the central office is actually shared by many homes; it is not until the fiber gets relatively close to the homes that it is split into individual customer-specific fibers. There are two competing optical-distribution network architectures that perform this splitting: active optical networks (AONs) and passive optical networks (PONs). AON is essentially switched Ethernet, which is discussed in <a class="xref" href="fileP70010119520000000000000000023B1.xhtml#P70010119520000000000000000023B1" data-foobar="7"><span class="label">Chapter</span> <span class="number">6</span></a>.</p>

In locations where DSL, cable, and FTTH are not available (e.g., in some rural settings), a satellite link can be used to connect a residence to the Internet at speeds of more than 1 Mbps; StarBand and HughesNet are two such satellite access providers. Dial-up access over traditional phone lines is based on the same model as DSL—a home modem connects over a phone line to a modem in the ISP. Compared with DSL and other broadband access networks, dial-up access is excruciatingly slow at 56 kbps.</p>

As we described these technologies, we also indicated the physical media used. For example, we said that HFC uses a combination of fiber cable and coaxial cable. We said that DSL and Ethernet use copper wire. And we said that mobile access networks use the radio spectrum. In this subsection we provide a brief overview of these and other transmission media that are commonly used in the Internet.</p>
<p id="P70010119520000000000000000097A0" data-uri="M01_KURO4140_07_SE_C01.xhtml#P70010119520000000000000000097A0">In order to define what is meant by a physical medium, let us reflect on the brief life of a bit. Consider a bit traveling from one end system, through a series of links and routers, to another end system. This poor bit gets kicked around and transmitted many, many <span class="pagebreak" title="19" id="P7001011952000000000000000000523" data-uri="M01_KURO4140_07_SE_C01.xhtml#P7001011952000000000000000000523" epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>times! The source end system first transmits the bit, and shortly thereafter the first router in the series receives the bit; the first router then transmits the bit, and shortly thereafter the second router receives the bit; and so on. Thus our bit, when traveling from source to destination, passes through a series of transmitter-receiver pairs. For each transmitter-receiver pair, the bit is sent by propagating electromagnetic waves or optical pulses across a <span class="keyword" id="P7001011952000000000000000000524" data-uri="M01_KURO4140_07_SE_C01.xhtml#P7001011952000000000000000000524"><b>physical medium</b></span>. The physical medium can take many shapes and forms and does not have to be of the same type for each transmitter-receiver pair along the path. Examples of physical media include twisted-pair copper wire, coaxial cable, multimode fiber-optic cable, terrestrial radio spectrum, and satellite radio spectrum. Physical media fall into two categories: <span class="keyword" id="P7001011952000000000000000000525" data-uri="M01_KURO4140_07_SE_C01.xhtml#P7001011952000000000000000000525"><b>guided media</b></span> and <span class="keyword" id="P7001011952000000000000000000526" data-uri="M01_KURO4140_07_SE_C01.xhtml#P7001011952000000000000000000526"><b>unguided media</b></span>. With guided media, the waves are guided along a solid medium, such as a fiber-optic cable, a twisted-pair copper wire, or a coaxial cable. With unguided media, the waves propagate in the atmosphere and in outer space, such as in a wireless LAN or a digital satellite channel.</p>
<p id="P70010119520000000000000000097A1" data-uri="M01_KURO4140_07_SE_C01.xhtml#P70010119520000000000000000097A1">But before we get into the characteristics of the various media types, let us say a few words about their costs. The actual cost of the physical link (copper wire, fiber-optic cable, and so on) is often relatively minor compared with other networking costs. In particular, the labor cost associated with the installation of the physical link can be orders of magnitude higher than the cost of the material. For this reason, many builders install twisted pair, optical fiber, and coaxial cable in every room in a building. Even if only one medium is initially used, there is a good chance that another medium could be used in the near future, and so money is saved by not having to lay additional wires in the future.</p>

<p id="P70010119520000000000000000097A3" data-uri="M01_KURO4140_07_SE_C01.xhtml#P70010119520000000000000000097A3">The least expensive and most commonly used guided transmission medium is twisted-pair copper wire. For over a hundred years it has been used by telephone networks. In fact, more than 99 percent of the wired connections from the telephone handset to the local telephone switch use twisted-pair copper wire. Most of us have seen twisted pair in our homes (or those of our parents or grandparents!) and work environments. Twisted pair consists of two insulated copper wires, each about 1 mm thick, arranged in a regular spiral pattern. The wires are twisted together to reduce the electrical interference from similar pairs close by. Typically, a number of pairs are bundled together in a cable by wrapping the pairs in a protective shield. A wire pair constitutes a single communication link. <span class="keyword" id="P700101195200000000000000000052B" data-uri="M01_KURO4140_07_SE_C01.xhtml#P700101195200000000000000000052B"><b>Unshielded twisted pair (UTP)</b></span> is commonly used for computer networks within a building, that is, for LANs. Data rates for LANs using twisted pair today range from 10 Mbps to 10 Gbps. The data rates that can be achieved depend on the thickness of the wire and the distance between transmitter and receiver.</p>
<p id="P70010119520000000000000000097A4" data-uri="M01_KURO4140_07_SE_C01.xhtml#P70010119520000000000000000097A4">When fiber-optic technology emerged in the 1980s, many people disparaged twisted pair because of its relatively low bit rates. Some people even felt that fiber-optic technology would completely replace twisted pair. But twisted pair did not give up so easily. Modern twisted-pair technology, such as category 6a cable, can achieve data rates of 10 Gbps for distances up to a hundred meters. In the end, twisted pair has emerged as the dominant solution for high-speed LAN networking.</p>

We saw that dial-up modem technology enables access at rates of up to 56 kbps over twisted pair. We also saw that DSL (digital subscriber line) technology has enabled residential users to access the Internet at tens of Mbps over twisted pair (when users live close to the ISP’s central office).</p>

With this construction and special insulation and shielding, coaxial cable can achieve high data transmission rates. Coaxial cable is quite common in cable television systems. As we saw earlier, cable television systems have recently been coupled with cable modems to provide residential users with Internet access at rates of tens of Mbps. In cable television and cable Internet access, the transmitter shifts the digital signal to a specific frequency band, and the resulting analog signal is sent from the transmitter to one or more receivers. Coaxial cable can be used as a guided <span class="keyword" id="P7001011952000000000000000000532" data-uri="M01_KURO4140_07_SE_C01.xhtml#P7001011952000000000000000000532"><b>shared medium</b></span>.

A single optical fiber can support tremendous bit rates, up to tens or even hundreds of gigabits per second. They are immune to electromagnetic interference, have very low signal attenuation up to 100 kilometers, and are very hard to tap. These characteristics have made fiber optics the preferred long-haul guided transmission media, particularly for overseas links. Many of the long-distance telephone networks in the United States and elsewhere now use fiber optics exclusively. Fiber optics is also prevalent in the backbone of the Internet. However, the high cost of optical devices—such as transmitters, receivers, and switches—has hindered their deployment for short-haul transport, such as in a LAN or into the home in a residential access network. The Optical Carrier (OC) standard link speeds range from 51.8 Mbps to 39.8 Gbps; these specifications are often referred to as OC-<i>n</i>, where the link speed equals <i>n</i> ∞ 51.8 Mbps.

They rotate around Earth (just as the Moon does) and may communicate with each other, as well as with ground stations. To provide continuous coverage to an area, many satellites need to be placed in orbit. There are currently many low-altitude communication systems in development. LEO satellite ­technology may be used for Internet access sometime in the future.</p>
