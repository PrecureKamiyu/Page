		<h1>Polynomial Interpolation</h1>
		<p>We are going to introduce two kinds of interpolation. One is called <b>Lagrange interpolation</b>. The other is called <b>Newton's interpolation</b></p>
		<h2>Lagrange interpolation</h2>
		<p>The main idea is to use the basis functions that is \(l _i (x _{j}) = \delta _{i} ^j\). The linear composition of basis functions can construct a polynomial that agree with the original function on the given \(n + 1\) points. </p>
		<p> \( \delta _{i} ^j\) is called Kronecker symbol. It equals to \(1\) if and only if \(i = j\). </p>
		<p>Any way it is easy to express the \(l_{i}\) which is a polynomial and have \(n\) roots and they are \(x _{j}\), \(j \ne i\), which leads to that the \(l_{i}\) can expressed as the following: 
		\[
		\prod _{0 \le j \le n, j \ne i} \frac{x - x _{j}}{x _{i} - x _{j}}
		\]</p>
		<p>There is a very good property 
		\[
			\sum _{   0 \le i \le  n }  l _{i} (x) =  1 
		\]and there is more 
		\[
			\sum _ { 0 \le i \le  n } x_ i ^ k  l _{i} (x) = x ^k 
		\]</p>
		<h2>The procedure of using Lagrange interpolation</h2>
		<p>Give a point, first use the expression of the \(l_{i}\) to calculate the value of the \(l_{i}\) on that point.
		And then we need to calculate the error function. Use the formula</p>
		\[
		E(x) = \frac{f ^ {(n+1)}(\xi)}{ ( n +1) !} p_{n+1} (x)
		\]
		<p>where the \(p\) is something like \( (x - x _{0}) (x  - x _{1}) \dots (x - x_{n})\). To tell the range of the \(E (x)\), we need to tell the maxium of the functions relating. </p>

		<h2>Newton's interpolation</h2>
		<p>Newton use something called <b>divided difference</b>. It is defined recursively.</p>
		<p><b>Basic:</b> \([x_{i}] =  f (x_{i})\)</p>
		<p><b>Induction:</b> \(\displaystyle [ x_{i} x_{i+1}\dots x _{i+ j}] = \frac{[x_{i+1} \dots x _{i+j}] - [ x_{i} \dots x _{i+j - 1}]}{x _{i+j} - x _{i}}\)</p>
