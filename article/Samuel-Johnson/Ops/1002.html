<p class="p24">This card was most agreeable; it was a prologue to that hospitable and truly polite reception which we found at Rasay. In a little while arrived Mr. Donald M&rsquo;Queen himself; a decent minister, an elderly man with his own black hair, courteous, and rather slow of speech, but candid, sensible, and well informed, nay learned. Along with him came, as our pilot, a gentleman whom I had a great desire to see, Mr. Malcolm Macleod, one of the Rasay family, celebrated in the year 1745-6. He was now sixty-two years of age, hale, and well proportioned, &mdash; with a manly countenance, tanned by the weather, yet having a ruddiness in his cheeks, over a great part of which his rough beard extended. His eye was quick and lively, yet his look was not fierce, but he appeared at once firm and good-humoured. He wore a pair of brogues, &mdash; Tartan hose which came up only near to his knees, and left them bare, &mdash; a purple camblet kilt, &mdash; a black waistcoat, &mdash; a short green cloth coat bound with gold cord, &mdash; a yellowish bushy wig, &mdash; a large blue bonnet with a gold thread button. I never saw a figure that gave a more perfect representation of a Highland gentleman. I wished much to have a picture of him just as he was. I found him frank and <span class="t8">polite</span>, in the true sense of the word.</p>
<p class="p24">The good family at Corrichatachin said, they hoped to see us on our return. We rode down to the shore; but Malcolm walked with graceful agility.</p>
<p class="p24">We got into Rasay&rsquo;s <span class="t8">carriage</span>, which was a good strong open boat made in Norway. The wind had now risen pretty high, and was against us; but we had four stout rowers, particularly a Macleod, a robust black-haired fellow, half naked, and bare-headed, something between a wild Indian and an English tar. Dr. Johnson sat high, on the stern, like a magnificent Triton. Malcolm sung an Erse song, the chorus of which was &lsquo;<span class="t8">Hatyin foam foam eri</span>&rsquo;, with words of his own. The tune resembled &lsquo;<span class="t8">Owr the muir amang the heather</span>&rsquo;. The boatmen and Mr. M&rsquo;Queen chorused, and all went well. At length Malcolm himself took an oar, and rowed vigorously. We sailed along the coast of Scalpa, a rugged island, about four miles in length. Dr. Johnson proposed that he and I should buy it, and found a good school, and an episcopal church, (Malcolm said, he would come to it,) and have a printing-press, where he would print all the Erse that could be found. Here I was strongly struck with our long projected scheme of visiting the Hebrides being realized. I called to him, &lsquo;We are contending with seas;&rsquo; which I think were the words of one of his letters to me. &lsquo;Not much,&rsquo; said he; and though the wind made the sea lash considerably upon us, he was not discomposed. After we were out of the shelter of Scalpa, and in the sound between it and Rasay, which extended about a league, the wind made the sea very rough. I did not like it. JOHNSON. &lsquo;This now is the Atlantick. If I should tell at a tea table in London, that I have crossed the Atlantick in an open boat, how they&rsquo;d shudder, and what a fool they&rsquo;d think me to expose myself to such danger?&rsquo; He then repeated Horace&rsquo;s ode, &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Otium Divos rogat in patenti</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prensus Aegaeo &mdash; &mdash; &lsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">In the confusion and hurry of this boisterous sail, Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s spurs, of which Joseph had charge, were carried over-board into the sea, and lost. This was the first misfortune that had befallen us. Dr. Johnson was a little angry at first, observing that &lsquo;there was something wild in letting a pair of spurs be carried into the sea out of a boat;&rsquo; but then he remarked, &lsquo;that, as Janes the naturalist had said upon losing his pocket-book, it was rather an inconvenience than a loss.&rsquo; He told us, he now recollected that he dreamt the night before, that he put his staff into a river, and chanced to let it go, and it was carried down the stream and lost. &lsquo;So now you see, (said he,) that I have lost my spurs; and this story is better than many of those which we have concerning second sight and dreams.&rsquo; Mr. M&rsquo;Queen said he did not believe the second sight; that he never met with any well attested instances; and if he should, he should impute them to chance; because all who pretend to that quality often fail in their predictions, though they take a great scope, and sometimes interpret literally, sometimes figuratively, so as to suit the events. He told us, that, since he came to be minister of the parish where he now is, the belief of witchcraft, or charms, was very common, insomuch that he had many prosecutions before his <span class="t8">session</span> (the parochial ecclesiastical court) against women, for having by these means carried off the milk from people&rsquo;s cows. He disregarded them; and there is not now the least vestige of that superstition. He preached against it; and in order to give a strong proof to the people that there was nothing in it, he said from the pulpit that every woman in the parish was welcome to take the milk from his cows, provided she did not touch them.</p>
<p class="p24">Dr. Johnson asked him as to <span class="t8">Fingal</span>. He said he could repeat some passages in the original, that he heard his grandfather had a copy of it; but that he could not affirm that Ossian composed all that poem as it is now published. This came pretty much to what Dr. Johnson had maintained; though he goes farther, and contends that it is no better than such an epick poem as he could make from the song of Robin Hood; that is to say, that, except a few passages, there is nothing truly ancient but the names and some vague traditions. Mr. M&rsquo;Queen alleged that Homer was made up of detached fragments. Dr. Johnson denied this; observing, that it had been one work originally, and that you could not put a book of the <span class="t8">Iliad</span> out of its place; and he believed the same might be said of the <span class="t8">Odyssey</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">The approach to Rasay was very pleasing. We saw before us a beautiful bay, well defended by a rocky coast; a good family mansion; a fine verdure about it, &mdash; with a considerable number of trees; &mdash; and beyond it hills and mountains in gradation of wildness. Our boatmen sung with great spirit. Dr. Johnson observed, that naval musick was very ancient. As we came near the shore, the singing of our rowers was succeeded by that of reapers, who were busy at work, and who seemed to shout as much as to sing, while they worked with a bounding activity. Just as we landed, I observed a cross, or rather the ruins of one, upon a rock, which had to me a pleasing vestige of religion. I perceived a large company coming out from the house. We met them as we walked up. There were Rasay himself; his brother Dr. Macleod; his nephew the Laird of M&rsquo;Kinnon; the Laird of Macleod; Colonel Macleod of Talisker, an officer in the Dutch service, a very genteel man, and a faithful branch of the family; Mr. Macleod of Muiravenside, best known by the name of Sandie Macleod, who was long in exile on account of the part which he took in 1745; and several other persons. We were welcomed upon the green, and conducted into the house, where we were introduced to Lady Rasay, who was surrounded by a numerous family, consisting of three sons and ten daughters. The Laird of Rasay is a sensible, polite, and most hospitable gentleman. I was told that his island of Rasay, and that of Rona, (from which the eldest son of the family has his title,) and a considerable extent of land which he has in Sky, do not altogether yield him a very large revenue: and yet he lives in great splendour; and so far is he from distressing his people, that, in the present rage for emigration, not a man has left his estate. It was past six o&rsquo;clock when we arrived. Some excellent brandy was served round immediately, according to the custom of the Highlands, where a dram is generally taken every day. They call it a <span class="t8">scalch</span>. On a side-board was placed for us, who had come off the sea, a substantial dinner, and a variety of wines. Then we had coffee and tea. I observed in the room several elegantly bound books, and other marks of improved life. Soon afterwards a fidler appeared, and a little ball began. Rasay himself danced with as much spirit as any man, and Malcolm bounded like a roe. Sandie Macleod, who has at times an excessive flow of spirits, and had it now, was, in his days of absconding, known by the name of <span class="t8">M&rsquo;Cruslick</span>, which it seems was the designation of a kind of wild man in the Highlands, something between Proteus and Don Quixote; and so he was called here. He made much jovial noise. Dr. Johnson was so delighted with this scene, that he said, &lsquo;I know not how we shall get away.&rsquo; It entertained me to observe him sitting by, while we danced, sometimes in deep meditation, &mdash; sometimes smiling complacently, &mdash; sometimes looking upon Hooke&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Roman History</span>, &mdash; and sometimes talking a little, amidst the noise of the ball, to Mr. Donald M&rsquo;Queen, who anxiously gathered knowledge from him. He was pleased with M&rsquo;Queen, and said to me, &lsquo;This is a critical man, Sir. There must be great vigour of mind to make him cultivate learning so much in the isle of Sky, where he might do without it. It is wonderful how many of the new publications he has. There must be a snatch of every opportunity.&rsquo; Mr. M&rsquo;Queen told me that his brother (who is the fourth generation of the family following each other as ministers of the parish of Snizort,) and he joined together, and bought from time to time such books as had reputation. Soon after we came in, a black cock and grey hen, which had been shot, were shewn, with their feathers on, to Dr. Johnson, who had never seen that species of bird before. We had a company of thirty at supper; and all was good humour and gaiety, without intemperance.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 9.</span></p>
<p class="p21">At breakfast this morning, among a profusion of other things, there were oat-cakes, made of what is called <span class="t8">graddaned</span> meal, that is, meal made of grain separated from the husks, and toasted by fire, instead of being threshed and kiln-dried. This seems to be bad management, as so much fodder is consumed by it. Mr. M&rsquo;Queen however defended it, by saying, that it is doing the thing much quicker, as one operation effects what is otherwise done by two. His chief reason however was, that the servants in Sky are, according to him, a faithless pack, and steal what they can; so that much is saved by the corn passing but once through their hands, as at each time they pilfer some. It appears to me, that the gradaning is a strong proof of the laziness of the Highlanders, who will rather make fire act for them, at the expence of fodder, than labour themselves. There was also, what I cannot help disliking at breakfast, cheese: it is the custom over all the Highlands to have it; and it often smells very strong, and poisons to a certain degree the elegance of an Indian repast. The day was showery; however, Rasay and I took a walk, and had some cordial conversation. I conceived a more than ordinary regard for this worthy gentleman. His family has possessed this island above four hundred years. It is the remains of the estate of Macleod of Lewis, whom he represents. When we returned, Dr. Johnson walked with us to see the old chapel. He was in fine spirits. He said,&rsquo; This is truly the patriarchal life: this is what we came to find.&rsquo; After dinner, M&rsquo;Cruslick, Malcolm, and I, went out with guns, to try if we could find any black-cock; but we had no sport, owing to a heavy rain. I saw here what is called a Danish fort. Our evening was passed as last night was. One of our company, I was told, had hurt himself by too much study, particularly of infidel metaphysicians; of which he gave a proof, on second sight being mentioned. He immediately retailed some of the fallacious arguments of Voltaire and Hume against miracles in general. Infidelity in a Highland gentleman appeared to me peculiarly offensive. I was sorry for him, as he had otherwise a good character. I told Dr. Johnson that he had studied himself into infidelity. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Then he must study himself out of it again. That is the way. Drinking largely will sober him again.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 10.</span></p>
<p class="p21">Having resolved to explore the Island of Rasay, which could be done only on foot, I last night obtained my fellow-traveller&rsquo;s permission to leave him for a day, he being unable to take so hardy a walk. Old Mr. Malcolm M&rsquo;Cleod, who had obligingly promised to accompany me, was at my bed-side between five and six. I sprang up immediately, and he and I, attended by two other gentlemen, traversed the country during the whole of this day. Though we had passed over not less than four-and-twenty miles of very rugged ground, and had a Highland dance on the top of <span class="t8">Dun Can</span>, the highest mountain in the island, we returned in the evening not at all fatigued, and piqued ourselves at not being outdone at the nightly ball by our less active friends, who had remained at home.</p>
<p class="p24">My survey of Rasay did not furnish much which can interest my readers; I shall therefore put into as short a compass as I can, the observations upon it, which I find registered in my journal. It is about fifteen English miles long, and four broad. On the south side is the laird&rsquo;s family seat, situated on a pleasing low spot. The old tower of three stories, mentioned by Martin, was taken down soon after 1746, and a modern house supplies its place. There are very good grass-fields and corn-lands about it, well-dressed. I observed, however, hardly any inclosures, except a good garden plentifully stocked with vegetables, and strawberries, raspberries, currants, &amp;c.</p>
<p class="p24">On one of the rocks just where we landed, which are not high, there is rudely carved a square, with a crucifix in the middle. Here, it is said, the Lairds of Rasay, in old times, used to offer up their devotions. I could not approach the spot, without a grateful recollection of the event commemorated by this symbol.</p>
<p class="p24">A little from the shore, westward, is a kind of subterraneous house. There has been a natural fissure, or separation of the rock, running towards the sea, which has been roofed over with long stones, and above them turf has been laid. In that place the inhabitants used to keep their oars. There are a number of trees near the house, which grow well; some of them of a pretty good size. They are mostly plane and ash. A little to the west of the house is an old ruinous chapel, unroofed, which never has been very curious. We here saw some human bones of an uncommon size. There was a heel-bone, in particular, which Dr. Macleod said was such, that if the foot was in proportion, it must have been twenty-seven inches long. Dr. Johnson would not look at the bones. He started back from them with a striking appearance of horrour. Mr. M&rsquo;Queen told us it was formerly much the custom, in these isles, to have human bones lying above ground, especially in the windows of churches. On the south of the chapel is the family burying-place. Above the door, on the east end of it, is a small bust or image of the Virgin Mary, carved upon a stone which makes part of the wall. There is no church upon the island. It is annexed to one of the parishes of Sky; and the minister comes and preaches either in Rasay&rsquo;s house, or some other house, on certain Sundays. I could not but value the family seat more, for having even the ruins of a chapel close to it. There was something comfortable in the thought of being so near a piece of consecrated ground. Dr. Johnson said, &lsquo;I look with reverence upon every place that has been set apart for religion;&rsquo; and he kept off his hat while he was within the walls of the chapel.</p>
<p class="p24">The eight crosses, which Martin mentions as pyramids for deceased ladies, stood in a semicircular line, which contained within it the chapel. They marked out the boundaries of the sacred territory within which an asylum was to be had. One of them, which we observed upon our landing, made the first point of the semicircle. There are few of them now remaining. A good way farther north, there is a row of buildings about four feet high; they run from the shore on the east along the top of a pretty high eminence, and so down to the shore on the west, in much the same direction with the crosses. Rasay took them to be the marks for the asylum; but Malcolm thought them to be false sentinels, a common deception, of which instances occur in Martin, to make invaders imagine an island better guarded. Mr. Donald M&rsquo;Queen, justly in my opinion, supposed the crosses which form the inner circle to be the church&rsquo;s land-marks.</p>
<p class="p24">The south end of the island is much covered with large stones or rocky strata. The laird has enclosed and planted part of it with firs, and he shewed me a considerable space marked out for additional plantations.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Dun Can</span> is a mountain three computed miles from the laird&rsquo;s house. The ascent to it is by consecutive risings, if that expression may be used when vallies intervene, so that there is but a short rise at once; but it is certainly very high above the sea. The palm of altitude is disputed for by the people of Rasay and those of Sky; the former contending for Dun Can, the latter for the mountains in Sky, over against it. We went up the east side of Dun Can pretty easily. It is mostly rocks all around, the points of which hem the summit of it. Sailors, to whom it was a good object as they pass along, call it Rasay&rsquo;s cap. Before we reached this mountain, we passed by two lakes. Of the first, Malcolm told me a strange fabulous tradition. He said, there was a wild beast in it, a sea horse, which came and devoured a man&rsquo;s daughter; upon which the man lighted a great fire, and had a sow roasted at it, the smell of which attracted the monster. In the fire was put a spit. The man lay concealed behind a low wall of loose stones, and he had an avenue formed for the monster, with two rows of large flat stones, which extended from the fire over the summit of the hill, till it reached the side of the loch. The monster came, and the man with the red-hot spit destroyed it. Malcolm shewed me the little hiding-place, and the rows of stones. He did not laugh when he told this story. I recollect having seen in the <span class="t8">Scots Magazine</span>, several years ago, a poem upon a similar tale, perhaps the same, translated from the Erse, or Irish, called <span class="t8">Albin and the Daughter of Mey</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">There is a large tract of land, possessed as a common, in Rasay. They have no regulations as to the number of cattle. Every man puts upon it as many as he chooses. From Dun Can northward, till you reach the other end of the island, there is much good natural pasture unincumbered by stones. We passed over a spot, which is appropriated for the exercising ground. In 1745, a hundred fighting men were reviewed here, as Malcolm told me, who was one of the officers that led them to the field. They returned home all but about fourteen. What a princely thing is it to be able to furnish such a band! Rasay has the true spirit of a chief. He is, without exaggeration, a father to his people.</p>
<p class="p24">There is plenty of lime-stone in the island, a great quarry of free-stone, and some natural woods, but none of any age, as they cut the trees for common country uses. The lakes, of which there are many, are well stocked with trout. Malcolm catched one of four-and-twenty pounds weight in the loch next to Dun Can, which, by the way, is certainly a Danish name, as most names of places in these islands are.</p>
<p class="p24">The old castle, in which the family of Rasay formerly resided, is situated upon a rock very near the sea. The rock is not one mass of stone, but a concretion of pebbles and earth, so firm that it does not appear to have mouldered. In this remnant of antiquity I found nothing worthy of being noticed, except a certain accommodation rarely to be found at the modern houses of Scotland, and which Dr. Johnson and I sought for in vain at the Laird of Rasay&rsquo;s new built mansion, where nothing else was wanting. I took the liberty to tell the Laird it was a shame there should be such a deficiency in civilized times. He acknowledged the justice of the remark. But perhaps some generations may pass before the want is supplied. Dr. Johnson observed to me, how quietly people will endure an evil, which they might at any time very easily remedy; and mentioned as an instance, that the present family of Rasay had possessed the island for more than four hundred years, and never made a commodious landing place, though a few men with pickaxes might have cut an ascent of stairs out of any part of the rock in a week&rsquo;s time.</p>
<p class="p24">The north end of Rasay is as rocky as the south end. From it I saw the little isle of Fladda, belonging to Rasay, all fine green ground; &mdash; and Rona, which is of so rocky a soil that it appears to be a pavement. I was told however that it has a great deal of grass in the interstices. The Laird has it all in his own hands. At this end of the island of Rasay is a cave in a striking situation. It is in a recess of a great cleft, a good way up from the sea. Before it the ocean roars, being dashed against monstrous broken rocks; grand and aweful <span class="t8">propugnacula</span>. On the right hand of it is a longitudinal cave, very low at the entrance, but higher as you advance. The sea having scooped it out, it seems strange and unaccountable that the interior part, where the water must have operated with less force, should be loftier than that which is more immediately exposed to its violence. The roof of it is all covered with a kind of petrifications formed by drops, which perpetually distil from it. The first cave has been a place of much safety. I find a great difficulty in describing visible objects. I must own too that the old castle and cave, like many other things of which one hears much, did not answer my expectations. People are every where apt to magnify the curiosities of their country.</p>
<p class="p24">This island has abundance of black cattle, sheep, and goats; &mdash; a good many horses, which are used for ploughing, carrying out dung, and other works of husbandry. I believe the people never ride. There are indeed no roads through the island, unless a few detached beaten tracks deserve that name. Most of the houses are upon the shore; so that all the people have little boats, and catch fish. There is great plenty of potatoes here. There are black-cock in extraordinary abundance, moorfowl, plover and wild pigeons, which seemed to me to be the same as we have in pigeon-houses, in their state of nature. Rasay has no pigeon-house. There are no hares nor rabbits in the island, nor was there ever known to be a fox, till last year, when one was landed on it by some malicious person, without whose aid he could not have got thither, as that animal is known to be a very bad swimmer. He has done much mischief. There is a great deal of fish caught in the sea round Rasay; it is a place where one may live in plenty, and even in luxury. There are no deer; but Rasay told us he would get some.</p>
<p class="p24">They reckon it rains nine months in the year in this island, owing to its being directly opposite to the western coast of Sky, where the watery clouds are broken by high mountains. The hills here, and indeed all the heathy grounds in general, abound with the sweet-smelling plant which the Highlanders call <span class="t8">gaul</span>, and (I think) with dwarf juniper in many places. There is enough of turf, which is their fuel, and it is thought there is a mine of coal. &mdash; Such are the observations which I made upon the island of Rasay, upon comparing it with the description given by Martin, whose book we had with us.</p>
<p class="p24">There has been an ancient league between the families of Macdonald and Rasay. Whenever the head of either family dies, his sword is given to the head of the other. The present Rasay has the late Sir James Macdonald&rsquo;s sword. Old Rasay joined the Highland army in 1745, but prudently guarded against a forfeiture, by previously conveying his estate to the present gentleman, his eldest son. On that occasion, Sir Alexander, father of the late Sir James Macdonald, was very friendly to his neighbour. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid, Rasay,&rsquo; said he; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll use all my interest to keep you safe; and if your estate should be taken, I&rsquo;ll buy it for the family.&rsquo; &mdash; And he would have done it.</p>
<p class="p24">Let me now gather some gold dust, &mdash; some more fragments of Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s conversation, without regard to order of time. He said, &lsquo;he thought very highly of Bentley; that no man now went so far in the kinds of learning that he cultivated; that the many attacks on him were owing to envy, and to a desire of being known, by being in competition with such a man; that it was safe to attack him, because he never answered his opponents, but let them die away. It was attacking a man who would not beat them, because his beating them would make them live the longer. And he was right not to answer; for, in his hazardous method of writing, he could not but be often enough wrong; so it was better to leave things to their general appearance, than own himself to have erred in particulars.&rsquo; He said, &lsquo;Mallet was the prettiest drest puppet about town, and always kept good company. That, from his way of talking he saw, and always said, that he had not written any part of the <span class="t8">Life of the Duke of Marlborough</span>, though perhaps he intended to do it at some time, in which case he was not culpable in taking the pension. That he imagined the Duchess furnished the materials for her <span class="t8">Apology</span>, which Hooke wrote, and Hooke furnished the words and the order, and all that in which the art of writing consists. That the duchess had not superior parts, but was a bold frontless woman, who knew how to make the most of her opportunities in life. That Hooke got a <span class="t8">large</span> sum of money for writing her <span class="t8">Apology</span>. That he wondered Hooke should have been weak enough to insert so profligate a maxim, as that to tell another&rsquo;s secret to one&rsquo;s friend is no breach of confidence; though perhaps Hooke, who was a virtuous man, as his <span class="t8">History</span> shews, and did not wish her well, though he wrote her <span class="t8">Apology</span>, might see its ill tendency, and yet insert it at her desire. He was acting only ministerially.&rsquo; I apprehended, however, that Hooke was bound to give his best advice. I speak as a lawyer. Though I have had clients whose causes I could not, as a private man, approve; yet, if I undertook them, I would not do any thing that might be prejudicial to them, even at their desire, without warning them of their danger.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 11.</span></p>
<p class="p21">It was a storm of wind and rain; so we could not set out. I wrote some of this <span class="t8">Journal</span>, and talked a while with Dr. Johnson in his room, and passed the day, I cannot well say how, but very pleasantly. I was here amused to find Mr. Cumberland&rsquo;s comedy of the <span class="t8">Fashionable Lover</span>, in which he has very well drawn a Highland character, Colin M&rsquo;Cleod, of the same name with the family under whose roof we now were. Dr. Johnson was much pleased with the Laird of Macleod, who is indeed a most promising youth, and with a noble spirit struggles with difficulties, and endeavours to preserve his people. He has been left with an incumbrance of forty thousand pounds debt, and annuities to the amount of thirteen hundred pounds a year. Dr. Johnson said, &lsquo;If he gets the better of all this, he&rsquo;ll be a hero; and I hope he will. I have not met with a young man who had more desire to learn, or who has learnt more. I have seen nobody that I wish more to do a kindness to than Macleod.&rsquo; Such was the honourable elogium, on this young chieftain, pronounced by an accurate observer, whose praise was never lightly bestowed.</p>
<p class="p24">There is neither justice of peace, nor constable in Rasay. Sky has Mr. M&rsquo;Cleod of Ulinish, who is the sheriff substitute, and no other justice of peace. The want of the execution of justice is much felt among the islanders. Macleod very sensibly observed, that taking away the heritable jurisdictions had not been of such service in the islands as was imagined. They had not authority enough in lieu of them. What could formerly have been settled at once, must now either take much time and trouble, or be neglected. Dr. Johnson said, &lsquo;A country is in a bad state which is governed only by laws; because a thousand things occur for which laws cannot provide, and where authority ought to interpose. Now destroying the authority of the chiefs set the people loose. It did not pretend to bring any positive good, but only to cure some evil; and I am not well enough acquainted with the country to know what degree of evil the heritable jurisdictions occasioned.&rsquo; I maintained hardly any; because the chiefs generally acted right, for their own sakes. Dr. Johnson was now wishing to move. There was not enough of intellectual entertainment for him, after he had satisfied his curiosity, which he did, by asking questions, till he had exhausted the island; and where there was so numerous a company, mostly young people, there was such a flow of familiar talk, so much noise, and so much singing and dancing, that little opportunity was left for his energetick conversation. He seemed sensible of this; for when I told him how happy they were at having him there, he said, &lsquo;Yet we have not been able to entertain them much.&rsquo; I was fretted, from irritability of nerves, by M&rsquo;Cruslick&rsquo;s too obstreperous mirth. I complained of it to my friend, observing we should be better if he was, gone. &lsquo;No, Sir (said he). He puts something into our society, and takes nothing out of it.&rsquo; Dr. Johnson, however, had several opportunities of instructing the company; but I am sorry to say, that I did not pay sufficient attention to what passed, as his discourse now turned chiefly on mechanicks, agriculture and such subjects, rather than on science and wit. Last night Lady Rasay shewed him the operation of <span class="t8">wawking</span> cloth, that is, thickening it in the same manner as is done by a mill. Here it is performed by women, who kneel upon the ground, and rub it with both their hands, singing an Erse song all the time. He was asking questions while they were performing this operation, and, amidst their loud and wild howl, his voice was heard even in the room above.</p>
<p class="p24">They dance here every night. The queen of our ball was the eldest Miss Macleod, of Rasay, an elegant well-bred woman, and celebrated for her beauty over all those regions, by the name of Miss Flora Rasay. There seemed to be no jealousy, no discontent among them; and the gaiety of the scene was such, that I for a moment doubted whether unhappiness had any place in Rasay. But my delusion was soon dispelled, by recollecting the following lines of my fellow-traveller: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Yet hope not life from pain or danger free,</p>
<p class="p24"><a id="a2665"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or think the doom of man revers&rsquo;d for thee!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">SUNDAY, SEPTEMBER 12.</span></p>
<p class="p21">It was a beautiful day, and although we did not approve of travelling on Sunday, we resolved to set out, as we were in an island from whence one must take occasion as it serves. Macleod and Talisker sailed in a boat of Rasay&rsquo;s for Sconser, to take the shortest way to Dunvegan. M&rsquo;Cruslick went with them to Sconser, from whence he was to go to Slate, and so to the main land. We were resolved to pay a visit at Kingsburgh, and see the celebrated Miss Flora Macdonald, who is married to the present Mr. Macdonald of Kingsburgh; so took that road, though not so near. All the family, but Lady Rasay, walked down to the shore to see us depart. Rasay himself went with us in a large boat, with eight oars, built in his island; as did Mr. Malcolm M&rsquo;Cleod, Mr. Donald M&rsquo;Queen, Dr. Macleod, and some others. We had a most pleasant sail between Rasay and Sky; and passed by a cave, where Martin says fowls were caught by lighting fire in the mouth of it. Malcolm remembers this. But it is not now practised, as few fowls come into it.</p>
<p class="p24">We spoke of Death. Dr. Johnson on this subject observed, that the boastings of some men, as to dying easily, were idle talk, proceeding from partial views. I mentioned Hawthornden&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Cypress-grove</span>, where it is said that the world is a mere show; and that it is unreasonable for a man to wish to continue in the show-room, after he has seen it. Let him go cheerfully out, and give place to other spectators. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Yes, Sir, if he is sure he is to be well, after he goes out of it. But if he is to grow blind after he goes out of the show-room, and never to see any thing again; or if he does not know whither he is to go next, a man will not go cheerfully out of a show-room. No wise man will be contented to die, if he thinks he is to go into a state of punishment. Nay, no wise man will be contented to die, if he thinks he is to fall into annihilation: for however unhappy any man&rsquo;s existence may be, he yet would rather have it, than not exist at all. No; there is no rational principle by which a man can die contented, but a trust in the mercy of GOD, through the merits of Jesus Christ.&rsquo; This short sermon, delivered with an earnest tone, in a boat upon the sea, which was perfectly calm, on a day appropriated to religious worship, while every one listened with an air of satisfaction, had a most pleasing effect upon my mind.</p>
<p class="p24">Pursuing the same train of serious reflection, he added that it seemed certain that happiness could not be found in this life, because so many had tried to find it, in such a variety of ways, and had not found it.</p>
<p class="p24">We reached the harbour of Portree, in Sky, which is a large and good one. There was lying in it a vessel to carry off the emigrants called the <span class="t8">Nestor</span>. It made a short settlement of the differences between a chief and his clan: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo; &mdash;&mdash; <span class="t8">Nestor</span> componere lites</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inter Peleiden festinat &amp; inter Atriden.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">We approached her, and she hoisted her colours. Dr. Johnson and Mr. McQueen remained in the boat: Rasay and I, and the rest went on board of her. She was a very pretty vessel, and, as we were told, the largest in Clyde. Mr. Harrison, the captain, shewed her to us. The cabin was commodious, and even elegant. There was a little library, finely bound. <span class="t8">Portree</span> has its name from King James the Fifth having landed there in his tour through the Western Isles, <span class="t8">Ree</span> in Erse being King, as <span class="t8">Re</span> is in Italian; so it is <span class="t8">Port Royal</span>. There was here a tolerable inn. On our landing, I had the pleasure of finding a letter from home; and there were also letters to Dr. Johnson and me, from Lord Elibank, which had been sent after us from Edinburgh. His Lordship&rsquo;s letter to me was as follows: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;DEAR BOSWELL,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I flew to Edinburgh the moment I heard of Mr. Johnson&rsquo;s arrival; but so defective was my intelligence, that I came too late. &lsquo;It is but justice to believe, that I could never forgive myself, nor deserve to be forgiven by others, if I was to fail in any mark of respect to that very great genius. &mdash; I hold him in the highest veneration; for that very reason I was resolved to take no share in the merit, perhaps guilt, of inticing him to honour this country with a visit. &mdash; I could not persuade myself there was any thing in Scotland worthy to have a Summer of Samuel Johnson bestowed on it; but since he has done us that compliment, for heaven&rsquo;s sake inform me of your motions. I will attend them most religiously; and though I should regret to let Mr. Johnson go a mile out of his way on my account, old as I am, I shall be glad to go five hundred miles to enjoy a day of his company. Have the charity to send a council-post with intelligence; the post does not suit us in the country. &mdash; At any rate write to me. I will attend you in the north, when I shall know where to find you. </p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My dear Boswell,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your sincerely</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obedient humble servant,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;ELIBANK.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;August 21st, 1773.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">The letter to Dr. Johnson was in these words: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I was to have kissed your hands at Edinburgh, the moment I heard of you; but you was gone.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I hope my friend Boswell will inform me of your motions. It will be cruel to deprive me an instant of the honour of attending you. As I value you more than any King in Christendom, I will perform that duty with infinitely greater alacrity than any courtier. I can contribute but little to your entertainment; but, my sincere esteem for you gives me some title to the opportunity of expressing it.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I dare say you are by this time sensible that things are pretty much the same, as when Buchanan complained of being born <span class="t8">solo et seculo inerudito</span>. Let me hear of you, and be persuaded that none of your admirers is more sincerely devoted to you, than, </p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dear Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your most obedient,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And most humble servant,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;ELIBANK.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Dr. Johnson, on the following Tuesday, answered for both of us, thus: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;My LORD, &lsquo;On the rugged shore of Skie, I had the honour of your Lordship&rsquo;s letter, and can with great truth declare, that no place is so gloomy but that it would be cheered by such a testimony of regard, from a mind so well qualified to estimate characters, and to deal out approbation in its due proportions. If I have more than my share, it is your Lordship&rsquo;s fault; for I have always reverenced your judgment too much, to exalt myself in your presence by any false pretensions.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Mr. Boswell and I are at present at the disposal of the winds, and therefore cannot fix the time at which we shall have the honour of seeing your lordship. But we should either of us think ourselves injured by the supposition that we would miss your lordship&rsquo;s conversation, when we could enjoy it; for I have often declared that I never met you without going away a wiser man. </p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;I am, my Lord,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your Lordship&rsquo;s most obedient</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And most humble servant,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Skie, Sept. 14, 1773.&rsquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">At Portree, Mr. Donald McQueen went to church and officiated in Erse, and then came to dinner. Dr. Johnson and I resolved that we should treat the company, so I played the landlord, or master of the feast, having previously ordered Joseph to pay the bill.</p>
<p class="p24">Sir James Macdonald intended to have built a village here, which would have done great good. A village is like a heart to a country. It produces a perpetual circulation, and gives the people an opportunity to make profit of many little articles, which would otherwise be in a good measure lost. We had here a dinner, <span class="t8">et praeterea nihil</span>. Dr. Johnson did not talk. When we were about to depart, we found that Rasay had been beforehand with us, and that all was paid: I would fain have contested this matter with him, but seeing him resolved, I declined it. We parted with cordial embraces from him and worthy Malcolm. In the evening Dr. Johnson and I remounted our horses, accompanied by Mr. McQueen and Dr. Macleod. It rained very hard. We rode what they call six miles, upon Rasay&rsquo;s lands in Sky, to Dr. Macleod&rsquo;s house. On the road Dr. Johnson appeared to be somewhat out of spirits. When I talked of our meeting Lord Elibank, he said, &lsquo;I cannot be with him much. I long to be again in civilized life; but can stay but a short while;&rsquo; (he meant at Edinburgh.) He said, &lsquo;let us go to Dunvegan to-morrow.&rsquo; &lsquo;Yes, (said I,) if it is not a deluge.&rsquo; &lsquo;At any rate,&rsquo; he replied. This shewed a kind of fretful impatience; nor was it to be wondered at, considering our disagreeable ride. I feared he would give up Mull and Icolmkill, for he said something of his apprehensions of being detained by bad weather in going to Mull and <span class="t8">Iona</span>. However I hoped well. We had a dish of tea at Dr. Macleod&rsquo;s, who had a pretty good house, where was his brother, a half-pay officer. His lady was a polite, agreeable woman. Dr. Johnson said, he was glad to see that he was so well married, for he had an esteem for physicians. The doctor accompanied us to Kingsburgh, which is called a mile farther; but the computation of Sky has no connection whatever with real distance. I was highly pleased to see Dr. Johnson safely arrived at Kingsburgh, and received by the hospitable Mr. Macdonald, who, with a most respectful attention, supported him into the house. Kingsburgh was completely the figure of a gallant Highlander, &mdash; exhibiting &lsquo;the graceful mien and manly looks,&rsquo; which our popular Scotch song has justly attributed to that character. He had his Tartan plaid thrown about him, a large blue bonnet with a knot of black ribband like a cockade, a brown short coat of a kind of duffil, a Tartan waistcoat with gold buttons and gold button-holes, a bluish philibeg, and Tartan hose. He had jet black hair tied behind, and was a large stately man, with a steady sensible countenance.</p>
<p class="p24">There was a comfortable parlour with a good fire, and a dram went round. By and by supper was served, at which there appeared the lady of the house, the celebrated Miss Flora Macdonald. She is a little woman, of a genteel appearance, and uncommonly mild and well-bred. To see Dr. Samuel Johnson, the great champion of the English Tories, salute Miss Flora Macdonald in the isle of Sky, was a striking sight; for though somewhat congenial in their notions, it was very improbable they should meet here.</p>
<p class="p24">Miss Flora Macdonald (for so I shall call her) told me, she heard upon the main land, as she was returning home about a fortnight before, that Mr. Boswell was coming to Sky, and one Mr. Johnson, a young English buck, with him. He was highly entertained with this fancy. Giving an account of the afternoon which we passed, at <span class="t8">Anock</span>, he said, &lsquo;I, being a <span class="t8">buck</span>, had miss in to make tea.&rsquo; He was rather quiescent to-night, and went early to bed. I was in a cordial humour, and promoted a cheerful glass. The punch was excellent. Honest Mr. M&rsquo;Queen observed that I was in high glee, &lsquo;my <span class="t8">governour</span> being gone to bed.&rsquo; Yet in reality my heart was grieved, when I recollected that Kingsburgh was embarrassed in his affairs, and intended to go to America. However, nothing but what was good was present, and I pleased myself in thinking that so spirited a man would be well every where. I slept in the same room with Dr. Johnson. Each had a neat bed, with Tartan curtains, in an upper chamber.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 13.</span></p>
<p class="p21">The room where we lay was a celebrated one. Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s bed was the very bed in which the grandson of the unfortunate King James the Second lay, on one of the nights after the failure of his rash attempt in 1745-6, while he was eluding the pursuit of the emissaries of government, which had offered thirty thousand pounds as a reward for apprehending him. To see Dr. Samuel Johnson lying in that bed, in the isle of Sky, in the house of Miss Flora Macdonald, struck me with such a group of ideas as it is not easy for words to describe, as they passed through the mind. He smiled, and said, &lsquo;I have had no ambitious thoughts in it.&rsquo; The room was decorated with a great variety of maps and prints. Among others, was Hogarth&rsquo;s print of Wilkes grinning, with a cap of liberty on a pole by him. That too was a curious circumstance in the scene this morning; such a contrast was Wilkes to the above groupe. It reminded me of Sir William Chambers&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Account of Oriental Gardening</span>, in which we are told all odd, strange, ugly, and even terrible objects, are introduced for the sake of variety; a wild extravagance of taste which is so well ridiculed in the celebrated Epistle to him. The following lines of that poem immediately occurred to me; </p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Here too, O king of vengeance! in thy fane,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tremendous Wilkes shall rattle his gold chain.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Upon the table in our room I found in the morning a slip of paper, on which Dr. Johnson had written with his pencil these words, </p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Quantum cedat virtutibus aurum.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">What he meant by writing them I could not tell. He had caught cold a day or two ago, and the rain yesterday having made it worse, he was become very deaf. At breakfast he said, he would have given a good deal rather than not have lain in that bed. I owned he was the lucky man; and observed, that without doubt it had been contrived between Mrs. Macdonald and him. She seemed to acquiesce; adding, &lsquo;You know young <span class="t8">bucks</span> are always favourites of the ladies.&rsquo; He spoke of Prince Charles being here, and asked Mrs. Macdonald, &lsquo;<span class="t8">Who</span> was with him? We were told, madam, in England, there was one Miss Flora Macdonald with him.&rsquo; She said, &lsquo;they were very right;&rsquo; and perceiving Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s curiosity, though he had delicacy enough not to question her, very obligingly entertained him with a recital of the particulars which she herself knew of that escape, which does so much honour to the humanity, fidelity, and generosity of the Highlanders. Dr. Johnson listened to her with placid attention, and said, &lsquo;All this should be written down.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">From what she told us, and from what I was told by others personally concerned, and from a paper of information which Rasay was so good as to send me, at my desire, I have compiled the following abstract, which, as it contains some curious anecdotes, will, I imagine, not be uninteresting to my readers, and even, perhaps, be of some use to future historians.</p>
<p class="p20">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p24">Prince Charles Edward, after the battle of Culloden, was conveyed to what is called the <span class="t8">Long Island</span>, where he lay for some time concealed. But intelligence having been obtained where he was, and a number of troops having come in quest of him, it became absolutely necessary for him to quit that country without delay. Miss Flora Macdonald, then a young lady, animated by what she thought the sacred principle of loyalty, offered, with the magnanimity of a Heroine, to accompany him in an open boat to Sky, though the coast they were to quit was guarded by ships. He dressed himself in women&rsquo;s clothes, and passed as her supposed maid, by the name of Betty Bourke, an Irish girl. They got off undiscovered, though several shots were fired to bring them to, and landed at Mugstot, the seat of Sir Alexander Macdonald. Sir Alexander was then at Fort Augustus, with the Duke of Cumberland; but his lady was at home. Prince Charles took his post upon a hill near the house. Flora Macdonald waited on lady Margaret, and acquainted her of the enterprise in which she was engaged. Her ladyship, whose active benevolence was ever seconded by superior talents, shewed a perfect presence of mind, and readiness of invention, and at once settled that Prince Charles should be conducted to old Rasay, who was himself concealed with some select friends. The plan was instantly communicated to Kingsburgh, who was dispatched to the hill to inform the Wanderer, and carry him refreshments. When Kingsburgh approached, he started up, and advanced, holding a large knotted stick, and in appearance ready to knock him down, till he said, &lsquo;I am Macdonald of Kingsburgh, come to serve your highness.&rsquo; The Wanderer answered, &lsquo;It is well,&rsquo; and was satisfied with the plan.</p>
<p class="p24">Flora Macdonald dined with Lady Margaret, at whose table there sat an officer of the army, stationed here with a party of soldiers, to watch for Prince Charles in case of his flying to the isle of Sky. She afterwards often laughed in good-humour with this gentleman, on her having so well deceived him. After dinner, Flora Macdonald on horseback, and her supposed maid, and Kingsburgh, with a servant carrying some linen, all on foot, proceeded towards that gentleman&rsquo;s house. Upon the road was a small rivulet which they were obliged to cross. The Wanderer, forgetting his assumed sex, that his clothes might not be wet, held them up a great deal too high. Kingsburgh mentioned this to him, observing, it might make a discovery. He said, he would be more careful for the future. He was as good as his word; for the next brook they crossed, he did not hold up his clothes at all, but let them float upon the water. He was very awkward in his female dress. His size was so large, and his strides so great, that some women whom they met reported that they had seen a very big woman, who looked like a man in woman&rsquo;s clothes, and that perhaps it was (as they expressed themselves) the <span class="t8">Prince</span>, after whom so much search was making.</p>
<p class="p24">At Kingsburgh he met with a most cordial reception; seemed gay at supper, and after it indulged himself in a cheerful glass with his worthy host. As he had not had his clothes off for a long time, the comfort of a good bed was highly relished by him, and he slept soundly till next day at one o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<p class="p24">The mistress of Corrichatachin told me, that in the forenoon she went into her father&rsquo;s room, who was also in bed, and suggested to him her apprehensions that a party of the military might come up, and that his guest and he had better not remain here too long. Her father said, &lsquo;Let the poor man repose himself after his fatigues; and as for me, I care not, though they take off this old grey head ten or eleven years sooner than I should die in the course of nature.&rsquo; He then wrapped himself in the bed-clothes, and again fell fast asleep.</p>
<p class="p24">On the afternoon of that day, the Wanderer, still in the same dress, set out for Portree, with Flora Macdonald and a man servant. His shoes being very bad, Kingsburgh provided him with a new pair, and taking up the old ones, said, &lsquo;I will faithfully keep them till you are safely settled at St. James&rsquo;s. I will then introduce myself by shaking them at you, to put you in mind of your night&rsquo;s entertainment and protection under my roof.&rsquo; He smiled, and said, &lsquo;Be as good as your word!&rsquo; Kingsburgh kept the shoes as long as he lived. After his death, a zealous Jacobite gentleman gave twenty guineas for them. Old Mrs. Macdonald, after her guest had left the house, took the sheets in which he had lain, folded them carefully, and charged her daughter that they should be kept unwashed, and that, when she died, her body should be wrapped in them as a winding sheet. Her will was religiously observed.</p>
<p class="p24">Upon the road to Portree, Prince Charles changed his dress, and put on man&rsquo;s clothes again; a tartan short coat and waistcoat, with philibeg and short hose, a plaid, and a wig and bonnet.</p>
<p class="p24">Mr. Donald M&rsquo;Donald, called Donald Roy, had been sent express to the present Rasay, then the young laird, who was at that time at his sister&rsquo;s house, about three miles from Portree, attending his brother, Dr. Macleod, who was recovering of a wound he had received at the battle of Culloden. Mr. M&rsquo;Donald communicated to young Rasay the plan of conveying the Wanderer to where old Rasay was; but was told that old Rasay had fled to Knoidart, a part of Glengary&rsquo;s estate. There was then a dilemma what should be done. Donald Roy proposed that he should conduct the Wanderer to the main land; but young Rasay thought it too dangerous at that time, and said it would be better to conceal him in the island of Rasay, till old Rasay could be informed where he was, and give his advice what was best. But the difficulty was, how to get him to Rasay. They could not trust a Portree crew, and all the Rasay boats had been destroyed, or carried off by the military, except two belonging to Malcolm M&rsquo;Leod, which he had concealed somewhere.</p>
<p class="p24">Dr. Macleod being informed of this difficulty, said he would risk his life once more for Prince Charles; and it having occurred, that there was a little boat upon a fresh-water lake in the neighbourhood, young Rasay and Dr. Macleod, with the help of some women, brought it to the sea, by extraordinary exertion, across a Highland mile of land, one half of which was bog, and the other a steep precipice.</p>
<p class="p24">These gallant brothers, with the assistance of one little boy, rowed the small boat to Rasay, where they were to endeavour to find Captain M&rsquo;Leod, as Malcolm was then called, and get one of his good boats, with which they might return to Portree, and receive the Wanderer; or, in case of not finding him, they were to make the small boat serve, though the danger was considerable.</p>
<p class="p24">Fortunately, on their first landing, they found their cousin Malcolm, who, with the utmost alacrity, got ready one of his boats, with two strong men, John M&rsquo;Kenzie, and Donald M&rsquo;Friar. Malcolm, being the oldest man, and most cautious, said, that as young Rasay had not hitherto appeared in the unfortunate business, he ought not to run any risk; but that Dr. Macleod and himself, who were already publickly engaged, should go on this expedition. Young Rasay answered, with an oath, that he would go, at the risk of his life and fortune. &lsquo;In GOD&rsquo;S name then (said Malcolm) let us proceed.&rsquo; The two boatmen, however, now stopped short, till they should be informed of their destination; and M&rsquo;Kenzie declared he would not move an oar till he knew where they were going. Upon which they were both sworn to secrecy; and the business being imparted to them, they were eager to put off to sea without loss of time. The boat soon landed about half a mile from the inn at Portree.</p>
<p class="p24">All this was negotiated before the Wanderer got forward to Portree. Malcolm M&rsquo;Leod and M&rsquo;Friar were dispatched to look for him. In a short time he appeared, and went into the publick house. Here Donald Roy, whom he had seen at Mugstot, received him, and informed him of what had been concerted. He wanted silver for a guinea, but the landlord had only thirteen shillings. He was going to accept of this for his guinea; but Donald Roy very judiciously observed, that it would discover him to be some great man; so he desisted. He slipped out of the house, leaving his fair protectress, whom he never again saw; and Malcolm Macleod was presented to him by Donald Roy, as a captain in his army. Young Rasay and Dr. Macleod had waited, in impatient anxiety, in the boat. When he came, their names were announced to him. He would not permit the usual ceremonies of respect, but saluted them as his equals.</p>
<p class="p24">Donald Roy staid in Sky, to be in readiness to get intelligence, and give an alarm in case the troops should discover the retreat to Rasay; and Prince Charles was then conveyed in a boat to that island in the night. He slept a little upon the passage, and they landed about day-break. There was some difficulty in accommodating him with a lodging, as almost all the houses in the island had been burnt by the soldiery. They repaired to a little hut, which some shepherds had lately built, and having prepared it as well as they could, and made a bed of heath for the stranger, they kindled a fire, and partook of some provisions which had been sent with him from Kingsburgh. It was observed, that he would not taste wheat-bread, or brandy, while oat-bread and whisky lasted; &lsquo;for these, said he, are my own country bread and drink.&rsquo; &mdash; This was very engaging to the Highlanders.</p>
<p class="p24">Young Rasay being the only person of the company that durst appear with safety, he went in quest of something fresh for them to eat: but though he was amidst his own cows, sheep, and goats, he could not venture to take any of them for fear of a discovery, but was obliged to supply himself by stealth. He therefore caught a kid, and brought it to the hut in his plaid, and it was killed and drest, and furnished them a meal which they relished much. The distressed Wanderer, whose health was now a good deal impaired by hunger, fatigue, and watching, slept a long time, but seemed to be frequently disturbed. Malcolm told me he would start from broken slumbers, and speak to himself in different languages, French, Italian, and English. I must however acknowledge, that it is highly probable that my worthy friend Malcolm did not know precisely the difference between French and Italian. One of his expressions in English was, &lsquo;O GOD! poor Scotland!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">While they were in the hut, M&rsquo;Kenzie and M&rsquo;Friar, the two boatmen, were placed as sentinels upon different eminences; and one day an incident happened, which must not be omitted. There was a man wandering about the island, selling tobacco. Nobody knew him, and he was suspected to be a spy. M&rsquo;Kenzie came running to the hut, and told that this suspected person was approaching. Upon which the three gentlemen, young Rasay, Dr. Macleod, and Malcolm, held a council of war upon him, and were unanimously of opinion that he should instantly be put to death. Prince Charles, at once assuming a grave and even severe countenance, said, &lsquo;God forbid that we should take away a man&rsquo;s life, who may be innocent, while we can preserve our own.&rsquo; The gentlemen however persisted in their resolution, while he as strenuously continued to take the merciful side. John M&rsquo;Kenzie, who sat watching at the door of the hut, and overheard the debate, said in Erse, &lsquo;Well, well; he must be shot. You are the king, but we are the parliament, and will do what we choose.&rsquo; Prince Charles, seeing the gentlemen smile, asked what the man had said, and being told it in English, he observed that he was a clever fellow, and, notwithstanding the perilous situation in which he was, laughed loud and heartily. Luckily the unknown person did not perceive that there were people in the hut, at least did not come to it, but walked on past it, unknowing of his risk. It was afterwards found out that he was one of the Highland army, who was himself in danger. Had he come to them, they were resolved to dispatch him; for, as Malcolm said to me, &lsquo;We could not keep him with us, and we durst not let him go. In such a situation, I would have shot my brother, if I had not been sure of him.&rsquo; John M&rsquo;Kenzie was at Rasay&rsquo;s house when we were there. About eighteen years before, he hurt one of his legs when dancing, and being obliged to have it cut off, he now was going about with a wooden leg. The story of his being a <span class="t8">member of parliament</span> is not yet forgotten. I took him out a little way from the house, gave him a shilling to drink Rasay&rsquo;s health, and led him into a detail of the particulars which I have just related. With less foundation, some writers have traced the idea of a parliament, and of the British constitution, in rude and early times. I was curious to know if he had really heard, or understood, any thing of that subject, which, had he been a greater man, would probably have been eagerly maintained. &lsquo;Why, John, (said I,) did you think the king should be controuled by a parliament?&rsquo; He answered, &lsquo;I thought, Sir, there were many voices against one.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">The conversation then turning on the times, the Wanderer said, that, to be sure, the life he had led of late was a very hard one; but he would rather live in the way he now did, for ten years, than fall into the hands of his enemies. The gentlemen asked him, what he thought his enemies would do with him, should he have the misfortune to fall into their hands. He said, he did not believe they would dare to take his life publickly, but he dreaded being privately destroyed by poison or assassination. He was very particular in his inquiries about the wound which Dr. Macleod had received at the battle of Culloden, from a ball which entered at one shoulder, and went cross to the other. The doctor happened still to have on the coat which he wore on that occasion. He mentioned, that he himself had his horse shot under him at Culloden; that the ball hit the horse about two inches from his knee, and made him so unruly that he was obliged to change him for another. He threw out some reflections on the conduct of the disastrous affair at Culloden, saying, however, that perhaps it was rash in him to do so. I am now convinced that his suspicions were groundless; for I have had a good deal of conversation upon the subject with my very worthy and ingenious friend, Mr. Andrew Lumisden, who was under secretary to Prince Charles, and afterwards principal secretary to his father at Rome, who, he assured me, was perfectly satisfied both of the abilities and honour of the generals who commanded the Highland army on that occasion. Mr. Lumisden has written an account of the three battles in 1745-6, at once accurate and classical. Talking of the different Highland corps, the gentlemen who were present wished to have his opinion which were the best soldiers. He said, he did not like comparisons among those corps: they were all best.</p>
<p class="p24">He told his conductors, he did not think it advisable to remain long in any one place; and that he expected a French ship to come for him to Lochbroom, among the Mackenzies. It then was proposed to carry him in one of Malcolm&rsquo;s boats to Lochbroom, though the distance was fifteen leagues coastwise. But he thought this would be too dangerous, and desired that, at any rate, they might first endeavour to obtain intelligence. Upon which young Rasay wrote to his friend, Mr. M&rsquo;Kenzie of Applecross, but received an answer, that there was no appearance of any French ship. It was therefore resolved that they should return to Sky, which they did, and landed in Strath, where they reposed in a cow-house belonging to Mr. Niccolson of Scorbreck. The sea was very rough, and the boat took in a good deal of water. The Wanderer asked if there was danger, as he was not used to such a vessel. Upon being told there was not, he sung an Erse song with much vivacity. He had by this time acquired a good deal of the Erse language.</p>
<p class="p24">Young Rasay was now dispatched to where Donald Roy was, that they might get all the intelligence they could; and the Wanderer, with much earnestness, charged Dr. Macleod to have a boat ready, at a certain place about seven miles off, as he said he intended it should carry him upon a matter of great consequence; and gave the doctor a case, containing a silver spoon, knife, and fork, saying, &lsquo;keep you that till I see you,&rsquo; which the doctor understood to be two days from that time. But all these orders were only blinds; for he had another plan in his head, but wisely thought it safest to trust his secrets to no more persons than was absolutely necessary. Having then desired Malcolm to walk with him a little way from the house, he soon opened his mind, saying, &lsquo;I deliver myself to you. Conduct me to the Laird of M&rsquo;Kinnon&rsquo;s country.&rsquo; Malcolm objected that it was very dangerous, as so many parties of soldiers were in motion. He answered, &lsquo;There is nothing now to be done without danger.&rsquo; He then said, that Malcolm must be the master, and he the servant; so he took the bag, in which his linen was put up, and carried it on his shoulder; and observing that his waistcoat, which was of scarlet tartan, with a gold twist button, was finer than Malcolm&rsquo;s, which was of a plain ordinary tartan, he put on Malcolm&rsquo;s waistcoat, and gave him his; remarking at the same time, that it did not look well that the servant should be better dressed than the master.</p>
<p class="p24">Malcolm, though an excellent walker, found himself excelled by Prince Charles, who told him, he should not much mind the parties that were looking for him, were he once but a musket shot from them; but that he was somewhat afraid of the Highlanders who were against him. He was well used to walking in Italy, in pursuit of game; and he was even now so keen a sportsman, that, having observed some partridges, he was going to take a shot: but Malcolm cautioned him against it, observing that the firing might be heard by the tenders who were hovering upon the coast.</p>
<p class="p24">As they proceeded through the mountains, taking many a circuit to avoid any houses, Malcolm, to try his resolution, asked him what they should do, should they fall in with a party of soldiers: he answered, &lsquo;Fight, to be sure!&rsquo; Having asked Malcolm if he should be known in his present dress, and Malcolm having replied he would, he said, &lsquo;Then I&rsquo;ll blacken my face with powder.&rsquo; &lsquo;That, said Malcolm, would discover you at once.&rsquo; &lsquo;Then, said he, I must be put in the greatest dishabille possible.&rsquo; So he pulled off his wig, tied a handkerchief round his head, and put his night-cap over it, tore the ruffles from his shirt, took the buckles out of his shoes, and made Malcolm fasten them with strings; but still Malcolm thought he would be known. &lsquo;I have so odd a face, (said he) that no man ever saw me but he would know me again.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He seemed unwilling to give credit to the horrid narrative of men being massacred in cold blood, after victory had declared for the army commanded by the Duke of Cumberland. He could not allow himself to think that a general could be so barbarous. When they came within two miles of M&rsquo;Kinnon&rsquo;s house, Malcolm asked if he chose to see the laird. &lsquo;No, (said he) by no means. I know M&rsquo;Kinnon to be as good and as honest a man as any in the world, but he is not fit for my purpose at present. You must conduct me to some other house; but let it be a gentleman&rsquo;s house.&rsquo; Malcolm then determined that they should go to the house of his brother-in-law, Mr. John M&rsquo;Kinnon, and from thence be conveyed to the main land of Scotland, and claim the assistance of Macdonald of Scothouse. The Wanderer at first objected to this, because Scothouse was cousin to a person of whom he had suspicions. But he acquiesced in Malcolm&rsquo;s opinion.</p>
<p class="p24">When they were near Mr. John M&rsquo;Kinnon&rsquo;s house, they met a man of the name of Ross, who had been a private soldier in the Highland army. He fixed his eyes steadily on the Wanderer in his disguise, and having at once recognized him, he clapped his hands, and exclaimed, &lsquo;Alas! is this the case?&rsquo; Finding that there was now a discovery, Malcolm asked &lsquo;What&rsquo;s to be done?&rsquo; &lsquo;Swear him to secrecy,&rsquo; answered Prince Charles. Upon which Malcolm drew his dirk, and on the naked blade, made him take a solemn oath, that he would say nothing of his having seen the Wanderer, till his escape should be made publick.</p>
<p class="p24">Malcolm&rsquo;s sister, whose house they reached pretty early in the morning, asked him who the person was that was along with him. He said it was one Lewis Caw, from Crieff, who being a fugitive like himself, for the same reason, he had engaged him as his servant, but that he had fallen sick. &lsquo;Poor man! (said she) I pity him. At the same time my heart warms to a man of his appearance.&rsquo; Her husband was gone a little way from home; but was expected every minute to return. She set down to her brother a plentiful Highland breakfast. Prince Charles acted the servant very well, sitting at a respectful distance, with his bonnet off. Malcolm then said to him, &lsquo;Mr. Caw, you have as much need of this as I have; there is enough for us both: you had better draw nearer and share with me.&rsquo; Upon which he rose, made a profound bow, sat down at table with his supposed master, and eat very heartily. After this there came in an old woman, who, after the mode of ancient hospitality, brought warm water, and washed Malcolm&rsquo;s feet. He desired her to wash the feet of the poor man who attended him. She at first seemed averse to this, from pride, as thinking him beneath her, and in the periphrastick language of the Highlanders and the Irish, said warmly, &lsquo;Though I washed your father&rsquo;s son&rsquo;s feet, why should I wash his father&rsquo;s son&rsquo;s feet?&rsquo; She was however persuaded to do it.</p>
<p class="p24">They then went to bed, and slept for some time; and when Malcolm awaked, he was told that Mr. John M&rsquo;Kinnon, his brother-in-law, was in sight. He sprang out to talk to him before he should see Prince Charles. After saluting him, Malcolm, pointing to the sea, said, &lsquo;What, John, if the prince should be prisoner on board one of those tenders?&rsquo; &lsquo;GOD forbid!&rsquo; replied John. &lsquo;What if we had him here?&rsquo; said Malcolm. &lsquo;I wish we had,&rsquo; answered John; &lsquo;we should take care of him.&rsquo; &lsquo;Well, John,&rsquo; said Malcolm, &lsquo;he is in your house.&rsquo; John, in a transport of joy, wanted to run directly in, and pay his obeisance; but Malcolm stopped him, saying, &lsquo;Now is your time to behave well, and do nothing that can discover him.&rsquo; John composed himself, and having sent away all his servants upon different errands, he was introduced into the presence of his guest, and was then desired to go and get ready a boat lying near his house, which, though but a small leaky one, they resolved to take, rather than go to the Laird of M&rsquo;Kinnon. John M&rsquo;Kinnon, however, thought otherwise; and upon his return told them, that his Chief and lady M&rsquo;Kinnon were coming in the laird&rsquo;s boat. Prince Charles said to his trusty Malcolm, &lsquo;I am sorry for this, but must make the best of it.&rsquo; M&rsquo;Kinnon then walked up from the shore, and did homage to the Wanderer. His lady waited in a cave, to which they all repaired, and were entertained with cold meat and wine. Mr. Malcolm M&rsquo;Leod being now superseded by the Laird of M&rsquo;Kinnon, desired leave to return, which was granted him, and Prince Charles wrote a short note, which he subscribed <span class="t8">James Thompson</span>, informing his friends that he had got away from Sky, and thanking them for their kindness; and he desired this might be speedily conveyed to young Rasay and Dr. Macleod, that they might not wait longer in expectation of seeing him again. He bade a cordial adieu to Malcolm, and insisted on his accepting of a silver stock-buckle, and ten guineas from his purse, though, as Malcolm told me, it did not appear to contain above forty. Malcolm at first begged to be excused, saying, that he had a few guineas at his service; but Prince Charles answered, &lsquo;You will have need of money. I shall get enough when I come upon the main land.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">The Laird of M&rsquo;Kinnon then conveyed him to the opposite coast of Knoidart. Old Rasay, to whom intelligence had been sent, was crossing at the same time to Sky; but as they did not know of each other, and each had apprehensions, the two boats kept aloof.</p>
<p class="p24">These are the particulars which I have collected concerning the extraordinary concealment and escapes of Prince Charles, in the Hebrides. He was often in imminent danger. The troops traced him from the Long Island, across Sky, to Portree, but there lost him.</p>
<p class="p24">Here I stop, &mdash; having received no farther authentick information of his fatigues and perils before he escaped to France. Kings and subjects may both take a lesson of moderation from the melancholy fate of the House of Stuart; that Kings may not suffer degradation and exile, and subjects may not be harassed by the evils of a disputed succession.</p>
<p class="p24">Let me close the scene on that unfortunate House with the elegant and pathetick reflections of <span class="t8">Voltaire</span>, in his <span class="t8">Histoire Générale</span>: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Que les hommes privés (says that brilliant writer, speaking of Prince Charles) qui se croyent malheureux, jettent les yeux sur ce prince et ses ancêtres.&rsquo; In another place he thus sums up the sad story of the family in general: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Il n&rsquo;y a aucun exemple dans l&rsquo;histoire d&rsquo;une maison si longtems infortunée. Le premier des Rois d&rsquo;Écosse, [ses aïeux] qui eut le nom de <span class="t8">Jacques</span>, après avoir été dix-huit ans prisonnier en Angleterre, mourut assassiné, avec sa femme, par la main de ses sujets. <span class="t8">Jacques</span> II, son fils, fut tué à vingt-neuf ans en combattant contre les Anglois. <span class="t8">Jacques</span> III, mis en prison par son peuple, fut tué ensuite par les révoltés, dans une bataille. <span class="t8">Jacques</span> IV, périt dans un combat qu&rsquo;il perdit. <span class="t8">Marie Stuart</span>, sa petite-fille, chassée de son trône, fugitive en Angleterre, ayant langui dix-huit ans en prison, se vit condamnée à mort par des juges Anglais, et eut la tête tranchée. <span class="t8">Charles</span> Ier, petit-fils de <span class="t8">Marie</span>, Roi d&rsquo;Écosse et d&rsquo;Angleterre, vendu par les Écossois, et jugé à mort par les Anglais, mourut sur un échafaud dans la place publique. <span class="t8">Jacques</span>, son fils, septième du nom, et deuxième en Angleterre, fut chassé de ses trois royaumes; et pour comble de malheur on contesta à son fils [jusqu&rsquo;à] sa naissance. Ce fils ne tenta de remonter sur le trône de ses pères, que pour faire périr ses amis par des bourreaux; et nous avons vu le Prince <span class="t8">Charles Édouard</span>, réunissant en vain les vertus de ses pères et le courage du Roi <span class="t8">Jean Sobieski</span>, son aïeul maternel, exécuter les exploits et essuyer les malheurs les plus incroyables. Si quelque chose justifie ceux qui croient une fatalité à laquelle rien ne peut se soustraire, c&rsquo;est cette suite continuelle de malheurs qui a persécuté la maison de <span class="t8">Stuart</span>, pendant plus de trois cents années.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">The gallant Malcolm was apprehended in about ten days after they separated, put aboard a ship and carried prisoner to London. He said, the prisoners in general were very ill treated in their passage; but there were soldiers on board who lived well, and sometimes invited him to share with them: that he had the good fortune not to be thrown into jail, but was confined in the house of a messenger, of the name of Dick. To his astonishment, only one witness could be found against him, though he had been so openly engaged; and therefore, for want of sufficient evidence, he was set at liberty. He added, that he thought himself in such danger, that he would gladly have compounded for banishment. Yet, he said, &lsquo;he should never be so ready for death as he then was.&rsquo; There is philosophical truth in this. A man will meet death much more firmly at one time than another. The enthusiasm even of a mistaken principle warms the mind, and sets it above the fear of death; which in our cooler moments, if we really think of it, cannot but be terrible, or at least very awful.</p>
<p class="p24">Miss Flora Macdonald being then also in London, under the protection of Lady Primrose, that lady provided a post-chaise to convey her to Scotland, and desired she might choose any friend she pleased to accompany her. She chose Malcolm. &lsquo;So (said he, with a triumphant air) I went to London to be hanged, and returned in a post-chaise with Miss Flora Macdonald.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Mr. Macleod of Muiravenside, whom we saw at Rasay, assured us that Prince Charles was in London in 1759, and that there was then a plan in agitation for restoring his family. Dr. Johnson could scarcely credit this story, and said, there could be no probable plan at that time. Such an attempt could not have succeeded, unless the King of Prussia had stopped the army in Germany; for both the army and the fleet would, even without orders, have fought for the King, to whom they had engaged themselves.</p>
<p class="p24">Having related so many particulars concerning the grandson of the unfortunate King James the Second; having given due praise to fidelity and generous attachment, which, however erroneous the judgment may be, are honourable for the heart; I must do the Highlanders the justice to attest, that I found every where amongst them a high opinion of the virtues of the King now upon the throne, and an honest disposition to be faithful subjects to his majesty, whose family has possessed the sovereignty of this country so long, that a change, even for the abdicated family, would now hurt the best feelings of all his subjects.</p>
<p class="p24">The <span class="t8">abstract</span> point of <span class="t8">right</span> would involve us in a discussion of remote and perplexed questions; and after all, we should have no clear principle of decision. That establishment, which, from political necessity, took place in 1688, by a breach in the succession of our kings, and which, whatever benefits may have accrued from it, certainly gave a shock to our monarchy, &mdash; the able and constitutional Blackstone wisely rests on the solid footing of authority. &lsquo;Our ancestors having most indisputably a competent jurisdiction to decide this great and important question, and having, in fact, decided it, it is now become our duty, at this distance of time, to acquiesce in their determination.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Mr. Paley, the present Archdeacon of Carlisle, in his <span class="t8">Principles of Moral and Political Philosophy</span>, having, with much clearness of argument, shewn the duty of submission to civil government to be founded neither on an indefeasible <span class="t8">jus divinum</span>, nor on <span class="t8">compact</span>, but on <span class="t8">expediency</span>, lays down this rational position: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Irregularity in the first foundation of a state, or subsequent violence, fraud, or injustice, in getting possession of the supreme power, are not sufficient reasons for resistance, after the government is once peaceably settled. No subject of the <span class="t8">British</span> empire conceives himself engaged to vindicate the justice of the <span class="t8">Norman</span> claim or conquest, or apprehends that his duty in any manner depends upon that controversy. So likewise, if the house of <span class="t8">Lancaster</span>, or even the posterity of <span class="t8">Cromwell</span>, had been at this day seated upon the throne of <span class="t8">England</span>, we should have been as little concerned to enquire how the founder of the family came there.&rsquo; In conformity with this doctrine, I myself, though fully persuaded that the House of <span class="t8">Stuart</span> had originally no right to the crown of <span class="t8">Scotland</span>; for that <span class="t8">Baliol</span>, and not <span class="t8">Bruce</span>, was the lawful heir; should yet have thought it very culpable to have rebelled, on that account, against Charles the First, or even a prince of that house much nearer the time, in order to assert the claim of the posterity of Baliol.</p>
<p class="p24">However convinced I am of the justice of that principle, which holds allegiance and protection to be reciprocal, I do however acknowledge, that I am not satisfied with the cold sentiment which would confine the exertions of the subject within the strict line of duty. I would have every breast animated with the <span class="t8">fervour</span> of loyalty; with that generous attachment which delights in doing somewhat more than is required, and makes &lsquo;service perfect freedom.&rsquo; And, therefore, as our most gracious Sovereign, on his accession to the throne, gloried in being <span class="t8">born a Briton</span>; so, in my more private sphere, <span class="t8">Ego me nunc</span> denique natum, <span class="t8">gratulor</span>. I am happy that a disputed succession no longer distracts our minds; and that a monarchy, established by law, is now so sanctioned by time, that we can fully indulge those feelings of loyalty which I am ambitious to excite. They are feelings which have ever actuated the inhabitants of the Highlands and the Hebrides. The plant of loyalty is there in full vigour, and the Brunswick graft now flourishes like a native shoot. To that spirited race of people I may with propriety apply the elegant lines of a modern poet, on the &lsquo;facile temper of the beauteous sex:&rsquo; &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Like birds new-caught, who flutter for a time,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And struggle with captivity in vain;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But by-and-by they rest, they smooth their plumes,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And to <span class="t8">new masters</span> sing their former notes.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Surely such notes are much better than the querulous growlings of suspicious Whigs and discontented Republicans.</p>
<p class="p20">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p24">Kingsburgh conducted us in his boat across one of the lochs, as they call them, or arms of the sea, which flow in upon all the coasts of Sky, &mdash; to a mile beyond a place called <span class="t8">Grishinish</span>. Our horses had been sent round by land to meet us. By this sail we saved eight miles of bad riding. Dr. Johnson said, &lsquo;When we take into computation what we have saved, and what we have gained, by this agreeable sail, it is a great deal.&rsquo; He observed, &lsquo;it is very disagreeable riding in Sky. The way is so narrow, one only at a time can travel, so it is quite unsocial; and you cannot indulge in meditation by yourself, because you must be always attending to the steps which your horse takes.&rsquo; This was a just and clear description of its inconveniences.</p>
<p class="p24">The topick of emigration being again introduced, Dr. Johnson said, that &lsquo;a rapacious chief would make a wilderness of his estate.&rsquo; Mr. Donald M&rsquo;Queen told us, that the oppression, which then made so much noise, was owing to landlords listening to bad advice in the letting of their lands; that interested and designed people flattered them with golden dreams of much higher rents than could reasonably be paid: and that some of the gentlemen <span class="t8">tacksmen</span>, or upper tenants, were themselves in part the occasion of the mischief, by over-rating the farms of others. That many of the <span class="t8">tacksmen</span>, rather than comply with exorbitant demands, had gone off to America, and impoverished the country, by draining it of its wealth; and that their places were filled by a number of poor people, who had lived under them, properly speaking, as servants, paid by a certain proportion of the produce of the lands, though called sub-tenants. I observed, that if the men of substance were once banished from a Highland estate, it might probably be greatly reduced in its value; for one bad year might ruin a set of poor tenants, and men of any property would not settle in such a country, unless from the temptation of getting land extremely cheap; for an inhabitant of any good county in Britain, had better go to America than to the Highlands or the Hebrides. Here, therefore, was a consideration that ought to induce a Chief to act a more liberal part, from a mere motive of interest, independent of the lofty and honourable principle of keeping a clan together, to be in readiness to serve his king. I added, that I could not help thinking a little arbitrary power in the sovereign, to control the bad policy and greediness of the Chiefs, might sometimes be of service. In France a Chief would not be permitted to force a number of the king&rsquo;s subjects out of the country. Dr. Johnson concurred with me, observing, that &lsquo;were an oppressive chieftain a subject of the French king, he would probably be admonished by a <span class="t8">letter</span>.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">During our sail, Dr. Johnson asked about the use of the dirk, with which he imagined the Highlanders cut their meat. He was told, they had a knife and fork besides, to eat with. He asked, how did the women do? and was answered, some of them had a knife and fork too; but in general the men, when they had cut their meat, handed their knives and forks to the women, and they themselves eat with their fingers. The old tutor of Macdonald always eat fish with his fingers, alledging that a knife and fork gave it a bad taste. I took the liberty to observe to Dr. Johnson, that he did so. &lsquo;Yes, said he; but it is because I am short-sighted, and afraid of bones, for which reason I am not fond of eating many kinds of fish, because I must use my fingers.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Dr. M&rsquo;Pherson&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Dissertations on Scottish Antiquities</span>, which he had looked at when at Corrichatachin, being mentioned, he remarked, that &lsquo;you might read half an hour, and ask yourself what you had been reading: there were so many words to so little matter, that there was no getting through the book.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">As soon as we reached the shore, we took leave of Kingsburgh, and mounted our horses. We passed through a wild moor, in many places so soft that we were obliged to walk, which was very fatiguing to Dr. Johnson. Once he had advanced on horseback to a very bad step. There was a steep declivity on his left, to which he was so near, that there was not room for him to dismount in the usual way. He tried to alight on the other side, as if he had been a <span class="t8">young buck</span> indeed, but in the attempt he fell at his length upon the ground; from which, however, he got up immediately without being hurt. During this dreary ride, we were sometimes relieved by a view of branches of the sea, that universal medium of connection amongst mankind. A guide, who had been sent with us from Kingsburgh, explored the way (much in the same manner as, I suppose, is pursued in the wilds of America,) by observing certain marks known only to the inhabitants. We arrived at Dunvegan late in the afternoon. The great size of the castle, which is partly old and partly new, and is built upon a rock close to the sea, while the land around it presents nothing but wild, moorish, hilly, and craggy appearances, gave a rude magnificence to the scene. Having dismounted, we ascended a flight of steps, which was made by the late Macleod, for the accommodation of persons coming to him by land, there formerly being, for security, no other access to the castle but from the sea; so that visitors who came by the land were under the necessity of getting into a boat, and sailed round to the only place where it could be approached. We were introduced into a stately dining-room, and received by Lady Macleod, mother of the laird, who, with his friend Talisker, having been detained on the road, did not arrive till some time after us.</p>
<p class="p24">We found the lady of the house a very polite and sensible woman, who had lived for some time in London, and had there been in Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s company. After we had dined, we repaired to the drawing-room, where some of the young ladies of the family, with their mother, were at tea. This room had formerly been the bed-chamber of Sir Roderick Macleod, one of the old Lairds; and he chose it, because, behind it, there was a considerable cascade, the sound of which disposed him to sleep. Above his bed was this inscription: &lsquo;Sir Rorie M&rsquo;Leod of Dunvegan, Knight. GOD send good rest!&rsquo; Rorie is the contraction of Roderick. He was called Rorie <span class="t8">More</span>, that is, great Rorie, not from his size, but from his spirit. Our entertainment here was in so elegant a style, and reminded my fellow-traveller so much of England, that he became quite joyous. He laughed, and said, &lsquo;Boswell, we came in at the wrong end of this island.&rsquo; &lsquo;Sir, (said I,) it was best to keep this for the last.&rsquo; He answered, &lsquo;I would have it both first and last.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 14.</span></p>
<p class="p21">Dr. Johnson said in the morning, &lsquo;Is not this a fine lady?&rsquo; There was not a word now of his &lsquo;impatience to be in civilized life; &mdash; though indeed I should beg pardon, &mdash; he found it here. We had slept well, and lain long. After breakfast we surveyed the castle, and the garden. Mr. Bethune, the parish minister, &mdash; Magnus M&rsquo;Leod, of Claggan, brother to Talisker, and M&rsquo;Leod of Bay, two substantial gentlemen of the clan, dined with us. We had admirable venison, generous wine; in a word, all that a good table has. This was really the hall of a chief. Lady M&rsquo;Leod had been much obliged to my father, who had settled by arbitration a variety of perplexed claims between her and her relation, the Laird of Brodie, which she now repaid by particular attention to me. M&rsquo;Leod started the subject of making women do penance in the church for fornication. JOHNSON. &lsquo;It is right, Sir. Infamy is attached to the crime, by universal opinion, as soon as it is known. I would not be the man who would discover it, if I alone knew it, for a woman may reform; nor would I commend a parson who divulges a woman&rsquo;s first offence; but being once divulged, it ought to be infamous. Consider, of what importance to society the chastity of women is. Upon that all the property in the world depends. We hang a thief for stealing a sheep; but the unchastity of a woman transfers sheep, and farm and all, from the right owner. I have much more reverence for a common prostitute than for a woman who conceals her guilt. The prostitute is known. She cannot deceive: she cannot bring a strumpet into the arms of an honest man, without his knowledge. BOSWELL. &lsquo;There is, however, a great difference between the licentiousness of a single woman, and that of a married woman.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Yes, Sir; there is a great difference between stealing a shilling, and stealing a thousand pounds; between simply taking a man&rsquo;s purse, and murdering him first, and then taking it. But when one begins to be vicious, it is easy to go on. Where single women are licentious, you rarely find faithful married women.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;And yet we are told that in some nations in India, the distinction is strictly observed.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Nay, don&rsquo;t give us India. That puts me in mind of Montesquieu, who is really a fellow of genius too in many respects; whenever he wants to support a strange opinion, he quotes you the practice of Japan or of some other distant country of which he knows nothing. To support polygamy, he tells you of the island of Formosa, where there are ten women born for one man. He had but to suppose another island, where there are ten men born for one woman, and so make a marriage between them.&rsquo; At supper, Lady Macleod mentioned Dr. Cadogan&rsquo;s book on the gout. JOHNSON. &lsquo;It is a good book in general, but a foolish one in particulars. It is good in general, as recommending temperance and exercise, and cheerfulness. In that respect it is only Dr. Cheyne&rsquo;s book told in a new way; and there should come out such a book every thirty years, dressed in the mode of the times. It is foolish, in maintaining that the gout is not hereditary, and that one fit of it, when gone, is like a fever when gone.&rsquo; Lady Macleod objected that the author does not practise what he teaches. JOHNSON. &lsquo;I cannot help that, madam. That does not make his book the worse. People are influenced more by what a man says, if his practice is suitable to it, &mdash; because they are blockheads. The more intellectual people are, the readier will they attend to what a man tells them. If it is just, they will follow it, be his practice what it will. No man practises so well as he writes. I have, all my life long, been lying till noon; yet I tell all young men, and tell them with great sincerity, that nobody who does not rise early will ever do any good. Only consider! You read a book; you are convinced by it; you do not know the authour. Suppose you afterwards know him, and find that he does not practise what he teaches; are you to give up your former conviction? At this rate you would be kept in a state of equilibrium, when reading every book, till you knew how the authour practised.&rsquo; &lsquo;But,&rsquo; said Lady M&rsquo;Leod, &lsquo;you would think better of Dr. Cadogan, if he acted according to his principles.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Madam, to be sure, a man who acts in the face of light, is worse than a man who does not know so much; yet I think no man should be the worse thought of for publishing good principles. There is something noble in publishing truth, though it condemns one&rsquo;s self.&rsquo; I expressed some surprize at Cadogan&rsquo;s recommending good humour, as if it were quite in our own power to attain it. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, a man grows better humoured as he grows older. He improves by experience. When young, he thinks himself of great consequence, and every thing of importance. As he advances in life, he learns to think himself of no consequence, and little things of little importance; and so he becomes more patient, and better pleased. All good-humour and complaisance are acquired. Naturally a child seizes directly what it sees, and thinks of pleasing itself only. By degrees, it is taught to please others, and to prefer others; and that this will ultimately produce the greatest happiness. If a man is not convinced of that, he never will practise it. Common language speaks the truth as to this: we say, a person is well <span class="t8">bred</span>. As it is said, that all material motion is primarily in a right line, and is never <span class="t8">per circuitum</span>, never in another form, unless by some particular cause; so it may be said intellectual motion is.&rsquo; Lady M&rsquo;Leod asked, if no man was naturally good? JOHNSON. &lsquo;No, Madam, no more than a wolf.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Nor no woman, Sir?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;No, Sir.&rsquo; Lady M&rsquo;Leod started at this, saying, in a low voice, &lsquo;This is worse than Swift.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">M&rsquo;Leod of Ulinish had come in the afternoon. We were a jovial company at supper. The Laird, surrounded by so many of his clan, was to me a pleasing sight. They listened with wonder and pleasure, while Dr. Johnson harangued. I am vexed that I cannot take down his full strain of eloquence.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 15.</span></p>
<p class="p21">The gentlemen of the clan went away early in the morning to the harbour of Lochbradale, to take leave of some of their friends who were going to America. It was a very wet day. We looked at Rorie More&rsquo;s horn, which is a large cow&rsquo;s horn, with the mouth of it ornamented with silver curiously carved. It holds rather more than a bottle and a half. Every Laird of M&rsquo;Leod, it is said, must, as a proof of his manhood, drink it off full of claret, without laying it down. From Rorie More many of the branches of the family are descended; in particular, the Talisker branch; so that his name is much talked of. We also saw his bow, which hardly any man now can bend, and his <span class="t8">Glaymore&gt;</span>, which was wielded with both hands, and is of a prodigious size. We saw here some old pieces of iron armour, immensely heavy. The broadsword now used, though called the <span class="t8">Glaymore, (i.e.</span> the <span class="t8">great sword</span>) is much smaller than that used in Rorie More&rsquo;s time. There is hardly a target now to be found in the Highlands. After the disarming act, they made them serve as covers to their butter-milk barrels; a kind of change, like beating spears into pruning-hooks.</p>
<p class="p24">Sir George Mackenzie&rsquo;s Works (the folio edition) happened to lie in a window in the dining room. I asked Dr. Johnson to look at the <span class="t8">Characteres Advocatorum</span>. He allowed him power of mind, and that he understood very well what he tells; but said, that there was too much declamation, and that the Latin was not correct. He found fault with <span class="t8">appropinquabant</span>, in the character of Gilmour. I tried him with the opposition between <span class="t8">gloria</span> and <span class="t8">palma</span>, in the comparison between Gilmour and Nisbet, which Lord Hailes, in his <span class="t8">Catalogue of the Lords of Session</span>, thinks difficult to be understood. The words are, <span class="t8">&lsquo;penes illum gloria, penes hunc palma</span>.&rsquo; In a short <span class="t8">Account of the Kirk of Scotland</span>, which I published some years ago, I applied these words to the two contending parties, and explained them thus: &lsquo;The popular party has most eloquence; Dr. Robertson&rsquo;s party most influence.&rsquo; I was very desirous to hear Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s explication. JOHNSON. &lsquo;I see no difficulty. Gilmour was admired for his parts; Nisbet carried his cause by his skill in law. <span class="t8">Palma</span> is victory.&rsquo; I observed, that the character of Nicholson, in this book resembled that of Burke: for it is said, in one place, <span class="t8">&lsquo;in omnes lusos &amp; jocos se saepe resolvebat</span>;&rsquo; and, in another, <span class="t8">&lsquo;sed accipitris more e conspectu aliquando astantium sublimi se protrahens volatu, in praedam miro impetu descendebat&rsquo;.</span> JOHNSON. &lsquo;No, Sir; I never heard Burke make a good joke in my life.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;But, Sir, you will allow he is a hawk.&rsquo; Dr. Johnson, thinking that I meant this of his joking, said, &lsquo;No, Sir, he is not the hawk there. He is the beetle in the mire.&rsquo; I still adhered to my metaphor,&mdash; &lsquo;But he <span class="t8">soars</span> as the hawk.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Yes, Sir; but he catches nothing.&rsquo; M&rsquo;Leod asked, what is the particular excellence of Burke&rsquo;s eloquence? JOHNSON. &lsquo;Copiousness and fertility of allusion; a power of diversifying his matter, by placing it in various relations. Burke has great information, and great command of language; though, in my opinion, it has not in every respect the highest elegance.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Do you think, Sir, that Burke has read Cicero much?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t believe it, Sir. Burke has great knowledge, great fluency of words, and great promptness of ideas, so that he can speak with great illustration on any subject that comes before him. He is neither like Cicero, nor like Demosthenes, nor like any one else, but speaks as well as he can.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">In the 65th page of the first volume of Sir George Mackenzie, Dr. Johnson pointed out a paragraph beginning with <span class="t8">Aristotle</span>, and told me there was an error in the text, which he bade me try to discover. I was lucky enough to hit it at once. As the passage is printed, it is said that the devil answers <span class="t8">even</span> in <span class="t8">engines</span>. I corrected it to &mdash; <span class="t8">ever</span> in <span class="t8">oenigmas</span>. &lsquo;Sir, (said he,) you are a good critick. This would have been a great thing to do in the text of an ancient authour.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 16.</span></p>
<p class="p21">Last night much care was taken of Dr. Johnson, who was still distressed by his cold. He had hitherto most strangely slept without a night-cap. Miss M&rsquo;Leod made him a large flannel one, and he was prevailed with to drink a little brandy when he was going to bed. He has great virtue in not drinking wine or any fermented liquor, because, as he acknowledged to us, he could not do it in moderation. Lady M&rsquo;Leod would hardly believe him, and said, &lsquo;I am sure, Sir, you would not carry it too far.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Nay, madam, it carried me. I took the opportunity of a long illness to leave it off. It was then prescribed to me not to drink wine; and, having broken off the habit, I have never returned to it.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">In the argument on Tuesday night, about natural goodness, Dr. Johnson denied that any child was better than another, but by difference of instruction; though, in consequence of greater attention being paid to instruction by one child than another, and of a variety of imperceptible causes, such as instruction being counteracted by servants, a notion was conceived, that of two children, equally well educated, one was naturally much worse than another. He owned, this morning, that one might have a greater aptitude to learn than another, and that we inherit dispositions from our parents. &lsquo;I inherited, (said he,) a vile melancholy from my father, which has made me mad all my life, at least not sober.&rsquo; Lady M&rsquo;Leod wondered he should tell this. &lsquo;Madam, (said I,) he knows that with that madness he is superior to other men.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I have often been astonished with what exactness and perspicuity he will explain the process of any art. He this morning explained to us all the operation of coining, and, at night, all the operation of brewing, so very clearly, that Mr. M&rsquo;Queen said, when he heard the first, he thought he had been bred in the Mint; when he heard the second, that he had been bred a brewer.</p>
<p class="p24">I was elated by the thought of having been able to entice such a man to this remote part of the world. A ludicrous, yet just image presented itself to my mind, which I expressed to the company. I compared myself to a dog who has got hold of a large piece of meat, and runs away with it to a corner, where he may devour it in peace, without any fear of others taking it from him. &lsquo;In London, Reynolds, Beauclerk, and all of them, are contending who shall enjoy Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s conversation. We are feasting upon it, undisturbed, at Dunvegan.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">It was still a storm of wind and rain. Dr. Johnson however walked out with M&rsquo;Leod, and saw Rorie More&rsquo;s cascade in full perfection. Colonel M&rsquo;Leod, instead of being all life and gaiety, as I have seen him, was at present grave, and somewhat depressed by his anxious concern about M&rsquo;Leod&rsquo;s affairs, and by finding some gentlemen of the clan by no means disposed to act a generous or affectionate part to their Chief in his distress, but bargaining with him as with a stranger. However, he was agreeable and polite, and Dr. Johnson said, he was a very pleasing man. My fellow-traveller and I talked of going to Sweden; and, while we were settling our plan, I expressed a pleasure in the prospect of seeing the king. JOHNSON. &lsquo;I doubt, Sir, if he would speak to us.&rsquo; Colonel M&rsquo;Leod said, &lsquo;I am sure Mr. Boswell would speak to <span class="t8">him</span>.&rsquo; But, seeing me a little disconcerted by his remark, he politely added, &lsquo;and with great propriety.&rsquo; Here let me offer a short defence of that propensity in my disposition, to which this gentleman alluded. It has procured me much happiness. I hope it does not deserve so hard a name as either forwardness or impudence. If I know myself, it is nothing more than an eagerness to share the society of men distinguished either by their rank or their talents, and a diligence to attain what I desire. If a man is praised for seeking knowledge, though mountains and seas are in his way, may he not be pardoned, whose ardour, in the pursuit of the same object, leads him to encounter difficulties as great, though of a different kind?</p>
<p class="p24">After the ladies were gone from table, we talked of the Highlanders not having sheets; and this led us to consider the advantage of wearing linen. JOHNSON. &lsquo;All animal substances are less cleanly than vegetable. Wool, of which flannel is made, is an animal substance; flannel therefore is not so cleanly as linen. I remember I used to think tar dirty; but when I knew it to be only a preparation of the juice of the pine, I thought so no longer. It is not disagreeable to have the gum that oozes from a plum-tree upon your fingers, because it is vegetable; but if you have any candle-grease, any tallow upon your fingers, you are uneasy till you rub it off. I have often thought, that if I kept a seraglio, the ladies should all wear linen gowns, &mdash; or cotton; I mean stuffs made of vegetable substances. I would have no silk; you cannot tell when it is clean: It will be very nasty before it is perceived to be so. Linen detects its own dirtiness.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">To hear the grave Dr. Samuel Johnson, &lsquo;that majestick teacher of moral and religious wisdom,&rsquo; while sitting solemn in an armchair in the Isle of Sky, talk, <span class="t8">ex cathedra</span>, of his keeping a seraglio, and acknowledge that the supposition had <span class="t8">often</span> been in his thoughts, struck me so forcibly with ludicrous contrast, that I could not but laugh immoderately. He was too proud to submit, even for a moment, to be the object of ridicule, and instantly retaliated with such keen sarcastick wit, and such a variety of degrading images, of every one of which I was the object, that, though I can bear such attacks as well as most men, I yet found myself so much the sport of all the company, that I would gladly expunge from my mind every trace of this severe retort.</p>
<p class="p24">Talking of our friend Langton&rsquo;s house in Lincolnshire, he said, &lsquo;the old house of the family was burnt. A temporary building was erected in its room; and to this day they have been always adding as the family increased. It is like a shirt made for a man when he was a child, and enlarged always as he grows older.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">We talked to-night of Luther&rsquo;s allowing the Landgrave of Hesse two wives, and that it was with the consent of the wife to whom he was first married. JOHNSON. &lsquo;There was no harm in this, so far as she was only concerned, because <span class="t8">volenti non fit injuria</span>. But it was an offence against the general order of society, and against the law of the Gospel, by which one man and one woman are to be united. No man can have two wives, but by preventing somebody else from having one.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 17.</span></p>
<p class="p21">After dinner yesterday, we had a conversation upon cunning. M&rsquo;Leod said that he was not afraid of cunning people; but would let them play their tricks about him like monkeys. &lsquo;But, (said I,) they&rsquo;ll scratch;&rsquo; and Mr. M&rsquo;Queen added, &lsquo;they&rsquo;ll invent new tricks, as soon as you find out what they do.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Cunning has effect from the credulity of others, rather than from the abilities of those who are cunning. It requires no extraordinary talents to lie and deceive.&rsquo; This led us to consider whether it did not require great abilities to be very wicked. JOHNSON. &lsquo;It requires great abilities to have the <span class="t8">power</span> of being very wicked; but not to <span class="t8">be</span> very wicked. A man who has the power, which great abilities procure him, may use it well or ill; and it requires more abilities to use it well, than to use it ill. Wickedness is always easier than virtue; for it takes the short cut to every thing. It is much easier to steal a hundred pounds, than to get it by labour, or any other way. Consider only what act of wickedness requires great abilities to commit it, when once the person who is to do it has the power; for <span class="t8">there</span> is the distinction. It requires great abilities to conquer an army, but none to massacre it after it is conquered.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">The weather this day was rather better than any that we had since we came to Dunvegan. Mr. M&rsquo;Queen had often mentioned a curious piece of antiquity near this, which he called a temple of the Goddess ANAITIS. Having often talked of going to see it, he and I set out after breakfast, attended by his servant, a fellow quite like a savage. I must observe here, that in Sky there seems to be much idleness; for men and boys follow you, as colts follow passengers upon a road. The usual figure of a Sky-boy, is a <span class="t8">lown</span> with bare legs and feet, a dirty <span class="t8">kilt</span>, ragged coat and waistcoat, a bare head, and a stick in his hand, which, I suppose, is partly to help the lazy rogue to walk, partly to serve as a kind of a defensive weapon. We walked what is called two miles, but is probably four, from the castle, till we came to the sacred place. The country around is a black dreary moor on all sides, except to the sea-coast, towards which there is a view through a valley; and the farm of <span class="t8">Bay</span> shews some good land. The place itself is green ground, being well drained by means of a deep glen on each side, in both of which there runs a rivulet with a good quantity of water, forming several cascades, which make a considerable appearance and sound. The first thing we came to was an earthen mound, or dyke, extending from the one precipice to the other. A little farther on was a strong stone-wall, not high, but very thick, extending in the same manner. On the outside of it were the ruins of two houses, one on each side of the entry or gate to it. The wall is built all along of uncemented stones, but of so large a size as to make a very firm and durable rampart. It has been built all about the consecrated ground, except where the precipice is steep enough to form an inclosure of itself. The sacred spot contains more than two acres. There are within it the ruins of many houses, none of them large, &mdash; a <span class="t8">cairn</span>, &mdash; and many graves marked by clusters of stones. Mr. M&rsquo;Queen insisted that the ruin of a small building, standing east and west, was actually the temple of the Goddess ANAITIS, where her statue was kept, and from whence processions were made to wash it in one of the brooks. There is, it must be owned, a hollow road, visible for a good way from the entrance; but Mr. M&rsquo;Queen, with the keen eye of an antiquary, traced it much farther than I could perceive it. There is not above a foot and a half in height of the walls now remaining; and the whole extent of the building was never, I imagine, greater than an ordinary Highland house. Mr. M&rsquo;Queen has collected a great deal of learning on the subject of the temple of ANAITIS; and I had endeavoured, in my <span class="t8">Journal</span>, to state such particulars as might give some idea of it, and of the surrounding scenery; but from the great difficulty of describing visible objects, I found my account so unsatisfactory, that my readers would probably have exclaimed </p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;And write about it, <span class="t8">Goddess</span>, and about it;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">and therefore I have omitted it.</p>
<p class="p24">When we got home, and were again at table with Dr. Johnson, we first talked of portraits. He agreed in thinking them valuable in families. I wished to know which he preferred, fine portraits, or those of which the merit was resemblance. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, their chief excellence is being like.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Are you of that opinion as to the portraits of ancestors, whom one has never seen?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;It then becomes of more consequence that they should be like; and I would have them in the dress of the times, which makes a piece of history. One should like to see how <span class="t8">Rorie More</span> looked. Truth, Sir, is of the greatest value in these things.&rsquo; Mr. M&rsquo;Queen observed, that if you think it of no consequence whether portraits are like, if they are but well painted, you may be indifferent whether a piece of history is true or not, if well told.</p>
<p class="p24">Dr. Johnson said at breakfast to-day, &lsquo;that it was but of late that historians bestowed pains and attention in consulting records, to attain to accuracy. Bacon, in writing his history of Henry VII, does not seem to have consulted any, but to have just taken what he found in other histories, and blended it with what he learnt by tradition.&rsquo; He agreed with me that there should be a chronicle kept in every considerable family, to preserve the characters and transactions of successive generations.</p>
<p class="p24">After dinner I started the subject of the temple of ANAITIS. Mr. M&rsquo;Queen had laid stress on the name given to the place by the country people, &mdash; <span class="t8">Ainnit</span>; and added, &lsquo;I knew not what to make of this piece of antiquity, till I met with the <span class="t8">Anaitidis delubrum</span> in Lydia, mentioned by Pausanias and the elder Pliny.&rsquo; Dr. Johnson, with his usual acuteness, examined Mr. M&rsquo;Queen as to the meaning of the word <span class="t8">Ainnit</span>, in Erse; and it proved to be a <span class="t8">water-place</span>, or a place near water, &lsquo;which,&rsquo; said Mr. M&rsquo;Queen, &lsquo;agrees with all the descriptions of the temples of that goddess, which were situated near rivers, that there might be water to wash the statue.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Nay, Sir, the argument from the name is gone. The name is exhausted by what we see. We have no occasion to go to a distance for what we can pick up under our feet. Had it been an accidental name, the similarity between it and Anaitis might have had something in it; but it turns out to be a mere physiological name.&rsquo; Macleod said, Mr. M&rsquo;Queen&rsquo;s knowledge of etymology had destroyed his conjecture. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Yes, Sir; Mr. M&rsquo;Queen is like the eagle mentioned by Waller, who was shot with an arrow feather&rsquo;d from his own wing.&rsquo; Mr. M&rsquo;Queen would not, however, give up his conjecture. JOHNSON. &lsquo;You have one possibility for you, and all possibilities against you. It is possible it may be the temple of Anaitis. But it is also possible that it may be a fortification; or it may be a place of Christian worship, as the first Christians often chose remote and wild places, to make an impression on the mind; or, if it was a heathen temple, it may have been built near a river, for the purpose of lustration; and there is such a multitude of divinities, to whom it may have been dedicated, that the chance of its being a temple of <span class="t8">Anaitis</span> is hardly any thing. It is like throwing a grain of sand upon the sea-shore to-day, and thinking you may find it to-morrow. No, Sir, this temple, like many an ill-built edifice, tumbles down before it is roofed in.&rsquo; In his triumph over the reverend antiquarian, he indulged himself in a <span class="t8">conceit</span>; for, some vestige of the <span class="t8">altar</span> of the goddess being much insisted on in support of the hypothesis, he said, &lsquo;Mr. M&rsquo;Queen is fighting <span class="t8">pro</span> aris <span class="t8">et focis&rsquo;</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">It was wonderful how well time passed in a remote castle, and in dreary weather. After supper, we talked of Pennant. It was objected that he was superficial. Dr. Johnson defended him warmly. He said, &lsquo;Pennant has greater variety of enquiry than almost any man, and has told us more than perhaps one in ten thousand could have done, in the time that he took. He has not said what he was to tell; so you cannot find fault with him, for what he has not told. If a man comes to look for fishes, you cannot blame him if he does not attend to fowls.&rsquo; &lsquo;But,&rsquo; said Colonel M&rsquo;Leod, &lsquo;he mentions the unreasonable rise of rents in the Highlands, and says, &ldquo;the gentlemen are for emptying the bag, without filling it;&rdquo; for that is the phrase he uses. Why does he not tell how to fill it?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, there is no end of negative criticism. He tells what he observes, and as much as he chooses. If he tells what is not true, you may find fault with him; but, though he tells that the land is not well cultivated, he is not obliged to tell how it may be well cultivated. If I tell that many of the Highlanders go bare-footed, I am not obliged to tell how they may get shoes. Pennant tells a fact. He need go no farther, except he pleases. He exhausts nothing; and no subject whatever has yet been exhausted. But Pennant has surely told a great deal. Here is a man six feet high, and you are angry because he is not seven.&rsquo; Notwithstanding this eloquent <span class="t8">Oratio pro Pennantio</span>, which they who have read this gentleman&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Tours</span>, and recollect the <span class="t8">Savage</span> and the <span class="t8">Shopkeeper</span> at <span class="t8">Monboddo</span>, will probably impute to the spirit of contradiction, I still think that he had better have given more attention to fewer things, than have thrown together such a number of imperfect accounts.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 18.</span></p>
<p class="p21">Before breakfast, Dr. Johnson came up to my room to forbid me to mention that this was his birthday; but I told him I had done it already; at which he was displeased; I suppose from wishing to have nothing particular done on his account. Lady M&rsquo;Leod and I got into a warm dispute. She wanted to build a house upon a farm which she has taken, about five miles from the castle, and to make gardens and other ornaments there; all of which I approved of; but insisted that the seat of the family should always be upon the rock of Dunvegan. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Ay, in time we&rsquo;ll build all round this rock. You may make a very good house at the farm; but it must not be such as to tempt the Laird of M&rsquo;Leod to go thither to reside. Most of the great families in England have a secondary residence, which is called a jointure-house: let the new house be of that kind.&rsquo; The lady insisted that the rock was very inconvenient; that there was no place near it where a good garden could be made; that it must always be a rude place; that it was a <span class="t8">Herculean</span> labour to make a dinner here. I was vexed to find the alloy of modern refinement in a lady who had so much old family spirit. &lsquo;Madam, (said I,) if once you quit this rock, there is no knowing where you may settle. You move five miles first; &mdash; then to St. Andrews, as the late Laird did; &mdash; then to Edinburgh; &mdash; and so on till you end at Hampstead, or in France. No, no; keep to the rock: it is the very jewel of the estate. It looks as if it had been let down from heaven by the four corners, to be the residence of a Chief. Have all the comforts and conveniences of life upon it, but never leave Rorie More&rsquo;s cascade.&rsquo; &lsquo;But, (said she,) is it not enough if we keep it? Must we never have more convenience than Rorie More had? he had his beef brought to dinner in one basket, and his bread in another. Why not as well be Rorie More all over, as live upon his rock? And should not we tire, in looking perpetually on this rock? It is very well for you, who have a fine place, and every thing easy, to talk thus, and think of chaining honest folks to a rock. You would not live upon it yourself.&rsquo; &lsquo;Yes, Madam, (said I,) I would live upon it, were I Laird of M&rsquo;Leod, and should be unhappy if I were not upon it.&rsquo; JOHNSON. (with a strong voice, and most determined manner), &lsquo;Madam, rather than quit the old rock, Boswell would live in the pit; he would make his bed in the dungeon.&rsquo; I felt a degree of elation, at finding my resolute feudal enthusiasm thus confirmed by such a sanction. The lady was puzzled a little. She still returned to her pretty farm, &mdash; rich ground, &mdash; fine garden. &lsquo;Madam, (said Dr. Johnson,) were they in Asia, I would not leave the rock.&rsquo; My opinion on this subject is still the same. An ancient family residence ought to be a primary object; and though the situation of Dunvegan be such that little can be done here in gardening, or pleasure-ground, yet, in addition to the veneration required by the lapse of time, it has many circumstances of natural grandeur, suited to the seat of a Highland Chief: it has the sea &mdash; islands &mdash; rocks, &mdash; hills, &mdash; a noble cascade; and when the family is again in opulence, something may be done by art. Mr. Donald M&rsquo;Queen went away to-day, in order to preach at Bracadale next day. We were so comfortably situated at Dunvegan, that Dr. Johnson could hardly be moved from it. I proposed to him that we should leave it on Monday. &lsquo;No, Sir, (said he,) I will not go before Wednesday. I will have some more of this good.&rsquo; However, as the weather was at this season so bad, and so very uncertain, and we had a great deal to do yet, Mr. M&rsquo;Queen and I prevailed with him to agree to set out on Monday, if the day should be good. Mr. M&rsquo;Queen, though it was inconvenient for him to be absent from his harvest, engaged to wait on Monday at Ulinish for us. When he was going away, Dr. Johnson said, &lsquo;I shall ever retain a great regard for you;&rsquo; then asked him if he had <span class="t8">The Rambler</span>. Mr. M&rsquo;Queen said, &lsquo;No; but my brother has it.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Have you <span class="t8">The Idler</span>? M&rsquo;QUEEN. &lsquo;No, Sir.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Then I will order one for you at Edinburgh, which you will keep in remembrance of me.&rsquo; Mr. M&rsquo;Queen was much pleased with this. He expressed to me, in the strongest terms, his admiration of Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s wonderful knowledge, and every other quality for which he is distinguished. I asked Mr. M&rsquo;Queen, if he was satisfied with being a minister in Sky. He said he was; but he owned that his forefathers having been so long there, and his having been born there, made a chief ingredient in forming his contentment. I should have mentioned that on our left hand, between Portree and Dr. Macleod&rsquo;s house, Mr. M&rsquo;Queen told me there had been a college of the Knights Templars; that tradition said so; and that there was a ruin remaining of their church, which had been burnt: but I confess Dr. Johnson has weakened my belief in remote tradition. In the dispute about <span class="t8">Anaitis</span>, Mr. M&rsquo;Queen said, Asia Minor was peopled by Scythians, and, as they were the ancestors of the Celts, the same religion might be in Asia Minor and Sky. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Alas! Sir, what can a nation that has not letters tell of its original. I have always difficulty to be patient when I hear authours gravely quoted, as giving accounts of savage nations, which accounts they had from the savages themselves. What can the <span class="t8">M&rsquo;Craas</span> tell about themselves a thousand years ago? There is no tracing the connection of ancient nations, but by language; and therefore I am always sorry when any language is lost, because languages are the pedigree of nations. If you find the same language in distant countries, you may be sure that the inhabitants of each have been the same people; that is to say, if you find the languages a good deal the same; for a word here and there being the same, will not do. Thus Butler, in his <span class="t8">Hudibras</span>, remembering that <span class="t8">Penguin</span>, in the Straits of Magellan, signifies a bird with a white head, and that the same word has, in Wales, the signification of a white-headed wench, (<span class="t8">pen</span> head, and <span class="t8">guin</span> white,) by way of ridicule, concludes that the people of those Straits are Welsh.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">A young gentleman of the name of M&rsquo;Lean, nephew to the Laird of the isle of Muck, came this morning; and, just as we sat down to dinner, came the Laird of the isle, of Muck himself, his lady, sister to Talisker, two other ladies their relations, and a daughter of the late M&rsquo;Leod of Hamer, who wrote a treatise on the second sight, under the designation of THEOPHILUS INSULANUS. It was somewhat droll to hear this Laird called by his title. <span class="t8">Muck</span> would have sounded ill; so he was called <span class="t8">Isle of Muck</span>, which went off with great readiness. The name, as now written, is unseemly, but it is not so bad in the original Erse, which is <span class="t8">Mouach</span>, signifying the Sows&rsquo; Island. Buchanan calls it INSULA PORCORUM. It is so called from its form. Some call it Isle of <span class="t8">Monk</span>. The Laird insists that this is the proper name. It was formerly church-land belonging to Icolmkill, and a hermit lived in it. It is two miles long, and about three quarters of a mile broad. The Laird said, he had seven score of souls upon it. Last year he had eighty persons inoculated, mostly children, but some of them eighteen years of age. He agreed with the surgeon to come and do it, at half a crown a head. It is very fertile in corn, of which they export some; and its coasts abound in fish. A taylor comes there six times in a year. They get a good blacksmith from the isle of Egg.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">SUNDAY, SEPTEMBER 19.</span></p>
<p class="p21">It was rather worse weather than any that we had yet. At breakfast Dr. Johnson said, &lsquo;Some cunning men choose fools for their wives, thinking to manage them, but they always fail. There is a spaniel fool and a mule fool. The spaniel fool may be made to do by beating. The mule fool will neither do by words or blows; and the spaniel fool often turns mule at last: and suppose a fool to be made do pretty well, you must have the continual trouble of making her do. Depend upon it, no woman is the worse for sense and knowledge.&rsquo; Whether afterwards he meant merely to say a polite thing, or to give his opinion, I could not be sure; but he added, &lsquo;Men know that women are an over-match for them, and therefore they choose the weakest or most ignorant. If they did not think so, they never could be afraid of women knowing as much as themselves.&rsquo; In justice to the sex, I think it but candid to acknowledge, that, in a subsequent conversation, he told me that he was serious in what he had said.</p>
<p class="p24">He came to my room this morning before breakfast, to read my Journal, which he has done all along. He often before said, &lsquo;I take great delight in reading it.&rsquo; To-day he said, &lsquo;You improve: it grows better and better.&rsquo; I observed, there was a danger of my getting a habit of writing in a slovenly manner. &lsquo;Sir,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;it is not written in a slovenly manner. It might be printed, were the subject fit for printing.&rsquo; While Mr. Beaton preached to us in the dining-room, Dr. Johnson sat in his own room, where I saw lying before him a volume of Lord Bacon&rsquo;s works, <span class="t8">The Decay of Christian Piety</span>, Monboddo&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Origin of Language</span>, and Sterne&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Sermons</span>. He asked me to-day how it happened that we were so little together: I told him, my Journal took up much time. Yet, on reflection, it appeared strange to me, that although I will run from one end of London to another to pass an hour with him, I should omit to seize any spare time to be in his company, when I am settled in the same house with him. But my Journal is really a task of much time and labour, and he forbids me to contract it.</p>
<p class="p24">I omitted to mention, in its place, that Dr. Johnson told Mr. M&rsquo;Queen that he had found the belief of the second sight universal in Sky, except among the clergy, who seemed determined against it. I took the liberty to observe to Mr. M&rsquo;Queen, that the clergy were actuated by a kind of vanity. &lsquo;The world, (say they,) takes us to be credulous men in a remote corner. We&rsquo;ll shew them that we are more enlightened than they think.&rsquo; The worthy man said, that his disbelief of it was from his not finding sufficient evidence; but I could perceive that he was prejudiced against it.</p>
<p class="p24">After dinner to-day, we talked of the extraordinary fact of Lady Grange&rsquo;s being sent to St. Kilda, and confined there for several years, without any means of relief. Dr. Johnson said, if M&rsquo;Leod would let it be known that he had such a place for naughty ladies, he might make it a very profitable island. We had, in the course of our tour, heard of St. Kilda poetry. Dr. Johnson observed, &lsquo;it must be very poor, because they have very few images.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;There may be a poetical genius shewn in combining these, and in making poetry of them.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, a man cannot make fire but in proportion as he has fuel. He cannot coin guineas but in proportion as he has gold.&rsquo; At tea he talked of his intending to go to Italy in 1775. M&rsquo;Leod said, he would like Paris better. JOHNSON. &lsquo;No, Sir; there are none of the French literati now alive, to visit whom I would cross a sea. I can find in Buffon&rsquo;s book all that he can say.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">After supper he said, &lsquo;I am sorry that prize-fighting is gone out; every art should be preserved, and the art of defence is surely important. It is absurd that our soldiers should have swords, and not be taught the use of them. Prize-fighting made people accustomed not to be alarmed at seeing their own blood, or feeling a little pain from a wound. I think the heavy <span class="t8">glaymore</span> was an ill-contrived weapon. A man could only strike once with it. It employed both his hands, and he must of course be soon fatigued with wielding it; so that if his antagonist could only keep playing a while, he was sure of him. I would fight with a dirk against Rorie More&rsquo;s sword. I could ward off a blow with a dirk, and then run in upon my enemy. When within that heavy sword, I have him; he is quite helpless, and I could stab him at my leisure, like a calf. It is thought by sensible military men, that the English do not enough avail themselves of their superior strength of body against the French; for that must always have a great advantage in pushing with bayonets. I have heard an officer say, that if women could be made to stand, they would do as well as men in a mere interchange of bullets from a distance: but, if a body of men should come close up to them, then to be sure they must be overcome; now, (said he,) in the same manner the weaker-bodied French must be overcome by our strong soldiers.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">The subject of duelling was introduced JOHNSON. &lsquo;There is no case in England where one or other of the combatants <span class="t8">must</span> die: if you have overcome your adversary by disarming him, that is sufficient, though you should not kill him; your honour, or the honour of your family, is restored, as much as it can be by a duel. It is cowardly to force your antagonist to renew the combat, when you know that you have the advantage of him by superior skill. You might just as well go and cut his throat while he is asleep in his bed. When a duel begins, it is supposed there may be an equality; because it is not always skill that prevails. It depends much on presence of mind; nay on accidents. The wind may be in a man&rsquo;s face. He may fall. Many such things may decide the superiority. A man is sufficiently punished, by being called out, and subjected to the risk that is in a duel.&rsquo; But on my suggesting that the injured person is equally subjected to risk, he fairly owned he could not explain the rationality of duelling.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 20.</span></p>
<p class="p21">When I awaked, the storm was higher still. It abated about nine, and the sun shone; but it rained again very soon, and it was not a day for travelling. At breakfast, Dr. Johnson told us, &lsquo;there was once a pretty good tavern in Catherine-street in the Strand, where very good company met in an evening, and each man called for his own half-pint of wine, or gill, if he pleased; they were frugal men, and nobody paid but for what he himself drank. The house furnished no supper; but a woman attended with mutton-pies, which any body might purchase. I was introduced to this company by Cumming the Quaker, and used to go there sometimes when I drank wine. In the last age, when my mother lived in London, there were two sets of people, those who gave the wall, and those who took it; the peaceable and the quarrelsome. When I returned to Lichfield, after having been in London, my mother asked me whether I was one of those who gave the wall, or those who took it. Now, it is fixed that every man keeps to the right; or, if one is taking the wall, another yields it, and it is never a dispute.&rsquo; He was very severe on a lady, whose name was mentioned. He said, he would have sent her to St. Kilda. That she was as bad as negative badness could be, and stood in the way of what was good: that insipid beauty would not go a great way; and that such a woman might be cut out of a cabbage, if there was a skilful artificer.</p>
<p class="p24">M&rsquo;Leod was too late in coming to breakfast. Dr. Johnson said, laziness was worse than the tooth-ach. BOSWELL. &lsquo;I cannot agree with you, Sir; a bason of cold water or a horse whip will cure laziness.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;No, Sir, it will only put off the fit; it will not cure the disease. I have been trying to cure my laziness all my life, and could not do it.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;But if a man does in a shorter time what might be the labour of a life, there is nothing to be said against him.&rsquo; JOHNSON (perceiving at once that I alluded to him and his <span class="t8">Dictionary</span>). &lsquo;Suppose that flattery to be true, the consequence would be, that the world would have no right to censure a man; but that will not justify him to himself.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">After breakfast, he said to me, &lsquo;A Highland Chief should now endeavour to do every thing to raise his rents, by means of the industry of his people. Formerly, it was right for him to have his house full of idle fellows; they were his defenders, his servants, his dependants, his friends. Now they may be better employed. The system of things is now so much altered, that the family cannot have influence but by riches, because it has no longer the power of ancient feudal times. An individual of a family may have it; but it cannot now belong to a family, unless you could have a perpetuity of men with the same views. M&rsquo;Leod has four times the land that the Duke of Bedford has. I think, with his spirit, he may in time make himself the greatest man in the King&rsquo;s dominions; for land may always be improved to a certain degree. I would never have any man sell land, to throw money into the funds, as is often done, or to try any other species of trade. Depend upon it, this rage of trade will destroy itself. You and I shall not see it; but the time will come when there will be an end of it. Trade is like gaming. If a whole company are gamesters, play must cease; for there is nothing to be won. When all nations are traders, there is nothing to be gained by trade, and it will stop first where it is brought to the greatest perfection. Then the proprietors of land only will be the great men.&rsquo; I observed, it was hard that M&rsquo;Leod should find ingratitude in so many of his people. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, gratitude is a fruit of great cultivation; you do not find it among gross people.&rsquo; I doubt of this. Nature seems to have implanted gratitude in all living creatures. The lion, mentioned by Aulus Gellius, had it. It appears to me that culture, which brings luxury and selfishness with it, has a tendency rather to weaken than promote this affection.</p>
<p class="p24">Dr. Johnson said this morning, when talking of our setting out, that he was in the state in which Lord Bacon represents kings. He desired the end, but did not like the means. He wished much to get home, but was unwilling to travel in Sky. &lsquo;You are like kings too in this, Sir, (said I,) that you must act under the direction of others.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 21.</span></p>
<p class="p21">The uncertainty of our present situation having prevented me from receiving any letters from home for some time, I could not help being uneasy. Dr. Johnson had an advantage over me, in this respect, he having no wife or child to occasion anxious apprehensions in his mind. It was a good morning; so we resolved to set out. But, before quitting this castle, where we have been so well entertained, let me give a short description of it.</p>
<p class="p24">Along the edge of the rock, there are the remains of a wall, which is now covered with ivy. A square court is formed by buildings of different ages, particularly some towers, said to be of great antiquity; and at one place there is a row of false cannon of stone. There is a very large unfinished pile, four stories high, which we were told was here when <span class="t8">Leod</span>, the first of this family, came from the Isle of Man, married the heiress of the M&rsquo;Crails, the ancient possessors of Dunvegan, and afterwards acquired by conquest as much land as he had got by marriage. He surpassed the house of Austria; for he was <span class="t8">felix</span> both <span class="t8">bella gerere</span> et <span class="t8">nubere</span>. John <span class="t8">Breck</span> M&rsquo;Leod, the grandfather of the late laird, began to repair the castle, or rather to complete it: but he did not live to finish his undertaking. Not doubting, however, that he should do it, he, like those who have had their epitaphs written before they died, ordered the following inscription, composed by the minister of the parish, to be cut upon a broad stone above one of the lower windows, where it still remains to celebrate what was not done, and to serve as a memento of the uncertainty of life, and the presumption of man: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Joannes Macleod Beganoduni Dominus gentis suae Philarchus, Durinesiae Haraiae Vaternesiae, &amp;c.: Baro D. Florae Macdonald matrimoniali vinculo conjugatus turrem hanc Beganodunensem proavorum habitaculum longe vetustissimum diu penitus labefectatam Anno aerae vulgaris MDCLXXXVI. instauravit. </p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Quem stabilire juvat proavorum tecta vetusta,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Omne scelus fugiat, justitiamque colat.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vertit in aerias turres magalia virtus,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inque casas humiles tecta superba nefas.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">M&rsquo;Leod and Talisker accompanied us. We passed by the parish church of <span class="t8">Durinish</span>. The church-yard is not inclosed, but a pretty murmuring brook runs along one side of it. In it is a pyramid erected to the memory of Thomas Lord Lovat, by his son Lord Simon, who suffered on Tower-hill. It is of free-stone, and, I suppose, about thirty feet high. There is an inscription on a piece of white marble inserted in it, which I suspect to have been the composition of Lord Lovat himself, being much in his pompous style: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;This pyramid was erected by SIMON LORD FRASER of LOVAT, in honour of Lord THOMAS his Father, a Peer of Scotland, and Chief of the great and ancient Clan of the FRASERS. Being attacked for his birthright by the family of ATHOLL, then in power and favour with KING WILLIAM, yet, by the valour and fidelity of his clan, and the assistance of the CAMPBELLS, the old friends and allies of his family, he defended his birthright with such greatness and fermety of soul, and such valour and activity, that he was an honour to his name, and a good pattern to all brave Chiefs of clans. He died in the month of May, 1699, in the 63rd year of his age, in Dunvegan, the house of the LAIRD of MAC LEOD, whose sister he had married: by whom he had the above SIMON LORD FRASER, and several other children. And, for the great love he bore to the family of MAC LEOD, he desired to be buried near his wife&rsquo;s relations, in the place where two of her uncles lay. And his son LORD SIMON, to shew to posterity his great affection for his mother&rsquo;s kindred, the brave MAC LEODS, chooses rather to leave his father&rsquo;s bones with them, than carry them to his own burial-place, near Lovat.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I have preserved this inscription, though of no great value, thinking it characteristical of a man who has made some noise in the world. Dr. Johnson said, it was poor stuff, such as Lord Lovat&rsquo;s butler might have written.</p>
<p class="p24">I observed, in this church-yard, a parcel of people assembled at a funeral, before the grave was dug. The coffin, with the corpse in it, was placed on the ground, while the people alternately assisted in making a grave. One man, at a little distance, was busy cutting a long turf for it, with the crooked spade which is used in Sky; a very aukward instrument. The iron part of it is like a plough-coulter. It has a rude tree for a handle, in which a wooden pin is placed for the foot to press upon. A traveller might, without further enquiry, have set this down as the mode of burying in Sky. I was told, however, that the usual way is to have a grave previously dug.</p>
<p class="p24">I observed to-day, that the common way of carrying home their grain here is in loads on horseback. They have also a few sleds, or <span class="t8">cars</span>, as we call them in Ayrshire, clumsily made, and rarely used.</p>
<p class="p24">We got to Ulinish about six o&rsquo;clock, and found a very good farm-house, of two stories. Mr. M&rsquo;Leod of Ulinish, the sheriff-substitute of the island, was a plain honest gentleman, a good deal like an English Justice of peace; not much given to talk, but sufficiently sagacious, and somewhat droll. His daughter, though she was never out of Sky, was a very well-bred woman. Our reverend friend, Mr. Donald M&rsquo;Queen, kept his appointment, and met us here.</p>
<p class="p24">Talking of Phipps&rsquo;s voyage to the North Pole, Dr. Johnson observed, that it &lsquo;was conjectured that our former navigators have kept too near land, and so have found the sea frozen far north, because the land hinders the free motion of the tide; but, in the wide ocean, where the waves tumble at their full convenience, it is imagined that the frost does not take effect.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 22.</span></p>
<p class="p21">In the morning I walked out, and saw a ship, the Margaret of Clyde, pass by with a number of emigrants on board. It was a melancholy sight. After breakfast, we went to see what was called a subterraneous house, about a mile off. It was upon the side of a rising ground. It was discovered by a fox&rsquo;s having taken up his abode in it, and in chasing him, they dug into it. It was very narrow and low, and seemed about forty feet in length. Near it, we found the foundations of several small huts, built of stone. Mr. M&rsquo;Queen, who is always for making every thing as ancient as possible, boasted that it was the dwelling of some of the first inhabitants of the island, and observed, what a curiosity it was to find here a specimen of the houses of the <span class="t8">Aborigines</span>, which he believed could be found no where else; and it was plain that they lived without fire. Dr. Johnson remarked, that they who made this were not in the rudest state; for that it was more difficult to make <span class="t8">it</span> than to build a house; therefore certainly those who made it were in possession of houses, and had this only as a hiding-place. It appeared to me, that the vestiges of houses, just by it, confirmed Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s opinion.</p>
<p class="p24">From an old tower, near this place, is an extensive view of Loch-Braccadil, and, at a distance, of the isles of Barra and South Uist; and on the land-side, the <span class="t8">Cuillin</span>, a prodigious range of mountains, capped with rocky pinnacles in a strange variety of shapes. They resemble the mountains near Corté in Corsica, of which there is a very good print. They make part of a great range for deer, which, though entirely devoid of trees, is in these countries called a <span class="t8">forest</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">In the afternoon, Ulinish carried us in his boat to an island possessed by him, where we saw an immense cave, much more deserving the title of <span class="t8">antrum immane</span> than that of the Sybil described by Virgil, which I likewise have visited. It is one hundred and eighty feet long, about thirty feet broad, and at least thirty feet high. This cave, we were told, had a remarkable echo; but we found none. They said it was owing to the great rains having made it damp. Such are the excuses by which the exaggeration of Highland narratives is palliated. There is a plentiful garden at Ulinish, (a great rarity in Sky,) and several trees; and near the house is a hill, which has an Erse name, signifying, <span class="t8">&lsquo;the hill of strife&rsquo;</span>, where, Mr. M&rsquo;Queen informed us, justice was of old administered. It is like the <span class="t8">mons placiti</span> of Scone, or those hills which are called <span class="t8">laws</span>, such as Kelly <span class="t8">law</span>, North Berwick <span class="t8">law</span>, and several others. It is singular that this spot should happen now to be the sheriff&rsquo;s residence.</p>
<p class="p24">We had a very cheerful evening, and Dr. Johnson talked a good deal on the subject of literature. Speaking of the noble family of Boyle, he said, that all the Lord Orrerys, till the present, had been writers. The first wrote several plays; the second was Bentley&rsquo;s antagonist; the third wrote the <span class="t8">Life of Swift</span>, and several other things; his son Hamilton wrote some papers in the <span class="t8">Adventurer</span> and <span class="t8">World</span>. He told us, he was well acquainted with Swift&rsquo;s Lord Orrery. He said, he was a feebleminded man; that, on the publication of Dr. Delany&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Remarks</span> on his book, he was so much alarmed that he was afraid to read them. Dr. Johnson comforted him, by telling him they were both in the right; that Delany had seen most of the good side of Swift, &mdash; Lord Orrery most of the bad. M&rsquo;Leod asked, if it was not wrong in Orrery to expose the defects of a man with whom he lived in intimacy. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why no, Sir, after the man is dead; for then it is done historically.&rsquo; He added, &lsquo;If Lord Orrery had been rich, he would have been a very liberal patron. His conversation was like his writings, neat and elegant, but without strength. He grasped at more than his abilities could reach; tried to pass for a better talker, a better writer, and a better thinker than he was. There was a quarrel between him and his father, in which his father was to blame; because it arose from the son&rsquo;s not allowing his wife to keep company with his father&rsquo;s mistress. The old lord shewed his resentment in his will, &mdash; leaving his library from his son, and assigning, as his reason, that he could not make use of it.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I mentioned the affectation of Orrery, in ending all his letters on the <span class="t8">Life of Swift</span> in studied varieties of phrase, and never in the common mode of <span class="t8">&lsquo;I am&rsquo;</span>, &amp;c., an observation which I remember to have been made several years ago by old Mr. Sheridan. This species of affectation in writing, as a foreign lady of distinguished talents once remarked to me, is almost peculiar to the English. I took up a volume of Dryden, containing the CONQUEST of GRANADA, and several other plays, of which all the dedications had such studied conclusions. Dr. Johnson said, such conclusions were more elegant, and in addressing persons of high rank, (as when Dryden dedicated to the Duke of York,) they were likewise more respectful. I agreed that <span class="t8">there</span> it was much better: it was making his escape from the Royal presence with a genteel sudden timidity, in place of having the resolution to stand still, and make a formal bow.</p>
<p class="p24">Lord Orrery&rsquo;s unkind treatment of his son in his will, led us to talk of the dispositions a man should have when dying. I said, I did not see why a man should act differently with respect to those of whom he thought ill when in health, merely because he was dying. JOHNSON. &lsquo;I should not scruple to speak against a party, when dying; but should not do it against an individual. It is told of Sixtus Quintus, that on his death-bed, in the intervals of his last pangs, he signed death-warrants.&rsquo; Mr. M&rsquo;Queen said, he should not do so; he would have more tenderness of heart. JOHNSON. &lsquo;I believe I should not either; but Mr. M&rsquo;Queen and I are cowards. It would not be from tenderness of heart; for the heart is as tender when a man is in health as when he is sick, though his resolution may be stronger. Sixtus Quintus was a sovereign as well as a priest; and, if the criminals deserved death, he was doing his duty to the last. You would not think a judge died ill, who should be carried off by an apoplectick fit while pronouncing sentence of death. Consider a class of men whose business it is to distribute death: &mdash; soldiers, who die scattering bullets. Nobody thinks they die ill on that account.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Talking of Biography, he said, he did not think that the life of any literary man in England had been well written. Beside the common incidents of life, it should tell us his studies, his mode of living, the means by which he attained to excellence, and his opinion of his own works. He told us, he had sent Derrick to Dryden&rsquo;s relations, to gather materials for his Life; and he believed Derrick had got all that he himself should have got; but it was nothing. He added, he had a kindness for Derrick, and was sorry he was dead.</p>
<p class="p24">His notion as to the poems published by Mr. M&rsquo;Pherson, as the works of Ossian, was not shaken here. Mr. M&rsquo;Queen always evaded the point of authenticity, saying only that Mr. M&rsquo;Pherson&rsquo;s pieces fell far short of those he knew in Erse, which were said to be Ossian&rsquo;s. JOHNSON. &lsquo;I hope they do. I am not disputing that you may have poetry of great merit; but that M&rsquo;Pherson&rsquo;s is not a translation from ancient poetry. You do not believe it. I say before you, you do not believe it, though you are very willing that the world should believe it.&rsquo; Mr. M&rsquo;Queen made no answer to this. Dr. Johnson proceeded. &lsquo;I look upon M&rsquo;Pherson&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Fingal</span> to be as gross an imposition as ever the world was troubled with. Had it been really an ancient work, a true specimen how men thought at that time, it would have been a curiosity of the first rate. As a modern production, it is nothing.&rsquo; He said, he could never get the meaning of an <span class="t8">Erse</span> song explained to him. They told him, the chorus was generally unmeaning. &lsquo;I take it, (said he,) Erse songs are like a song which I remember: it was composed in Queen Elizabeth&rsquo;s time, on the Earl of Essex: and the burthen was </p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Radaratoo, radarate, radara tadara tandore.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;But surely,&rsquo; said Mr. M&rsquo;Queen, &lsquo;there were words to it, which had meaning.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, yes, Sir; I recollect a stanza, and you shall have it: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;O! then bespoke the prentices all,</p>

<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Essex&rsquo;s sake they would fight all.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Radaratoo, radarate, radara, tadara, tandore.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">When Mr. M&rsquo;Queen began again to expatiate on the beauty of Ossian&rsquo;s poetry, Dr. Johnson entered into no farther controversy, but, with a pleasant smile, only cried, &lsquo;Ay, ay; <span class="t8">Radaratoo radarate&rsquo;</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 23.</span></p>
<p class="p21">I took <span class="t8">Fingal</span> down to the parlour in the morning, and tried a test proposed by Mr. Roderick M&rsquo;Leod, son to Ulinish. Mr. M&rsquo;Queen had said he had some of the poem in the original. I desired him to mention any passage in the printed book, of which he could repeat the original. He pointed out one in page 50 of the quarto edition, and read the Erse, while Mr. Roderick M&rsquo;Leod and I looked on the English; &mdash; and Mr. M&rsquo;Leod said, that it was pretty like what Mr. M&rsquo;Queen had recited. But when Mr. M&rsquo;Queen read a description of Cuchullin&rsquo;s sword in Erse, together with a translation of it in English verse, by Sir James Foulis, Mr. M&rsquo;Leod said, that was much more like than Mr. M&rsquo;Pherson&rsquo;s translation of the former passage. Mr. M&rsquo;Queen then repeated in Erse a description of one of the horses in Cuchillin&rsquo;s car. Mr. M&rsquo;Leod said, Mr. M&rsquo;Pherson&rsquo;s English was nothing like it.</p>
<p class="p24">When Dr. Johnson came down, I told him that I had now obtained some evidence concerning <span class="t8">Fingal</span>; for that Mr. M&rsquo;Queen had repeated a passage in the original Erse, which Mr. M&rsquo;Pherson&rsquo;s translation was pretty like; and reminded him that he himself had once said, he did not require Mr. M&rsquo;Pherson&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Ossian</span> to be more like the original than Pope&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Homer</span>. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Well, Sir, this is just what I always maintained. He has found names, and stories, and phrases, nay, passages in old songs, and with them has blended his own compositions, and so made what he gives to the world as the translation of an ancient poem.&rsquo; If this was the case, I observed, it was wrong to publish it as a poem in six books. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Yes, Sir; and to ascribe it to a time too when the Highlanders knew nothing of <span class="t8">books</span>, and nothing of <span class="t8">six</span>; &mdash; or perhaps were got the length of counting six. We have been told, by Condamine, of a nation that could count no more than four. This should be told to Monboddo; it would help him. There is as much charity in helping a man down-hill, as in helping him up-hill.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think there is as much charity.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Yes, Sir, if his <span class="t8">tendency</span> be downwards. Till he is at the bottom he flounders; get him once there, and he is quiet. Swift tells, that Stella had a trick, which she learned from Addison, of encouraging a man in absurdity, instead of endeavouring to extricate him.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Mr. M&rsquo;Queen&rsquo;s answers to the inquiries concerning <span class="t8">Ossian</span> were so unsatisfactory, that I could not help observing, that, were he examined in a court of justice, he would find himself under a necessity of being more explicit. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, he has told Blair a little too much, which is published; and he sticks to it. He is so much at the head of things here, that he has never been accustomed to be closely examined; and so he goes on quite smoothly.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;He has never had any body to work him.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;No, Sir; and a man is seldom disposed to work himself; though he ought to work himself, to be sure.&rsquo; Mr. M&rsquo;Queen made no reply.</p>
<p class="p24">Having talked of the strictness with which witnesses are examined in courts of justice, Dr. Johnson told us, that Garrick, though accustomed to face multitudes, when produced as a witness in Westminster-hall, was so disconcerted by a new mode of public appearance, that he could not understand what was asked. It was a cause where an actor claimed a <span class="t8">free benefit</span>; that is to say, a benefit without paying the expence of the house; but the meaning of the term was disputed. Garrick was asked, &lsquo;Sir, have you a free benefit?&rsquo; &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo; &lsquo;Upon what terms have you it?&rsquo; &lsquo;Upon-the terms-of-a free benefit.&rsquo; He was dismissed as one from whom no information could be obtained. Dr. Johnson is often too hard on our friend Mr. Garrick. When I asked him why he did not mention him in the Preface to his <span class="t8">Shakspeare</span> he said, &lsquo;Garrick has been liberally paid for any thing he has done for Shakspeare. If I should praise him, I should much more praise the nation who paid him. He has not made Shakspeare better known; he cannot illustrate Shakspeare; so I have reasons enough against mentioning him, were reasons necessary. There should be reasons <span class="t8">for</span> it.&rsquo; I spoke of Mrs. Montague&rsquo;s very high praises of Garrick. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, it is fit she should say so much, and I should say nothing. Reynolds is fond of her book, and I wonder at it; for neither I, nor Beauclerk, nor Mrs. Thrale, could get through it.&rsquo; Last night Dr. Johnson gave us an account of the whole process of tanning and of the nature of milk, and the various operations upon it, as making whey, &amp;c. His variety of information is surprizing; and it gives one much satisfaction to find such a man bestowing his attention on the useful arts of life. Ulinish was much struck with his knowledge; and said, &lsquo;He is a great orator, Sir; it is musick to hear this man speak.&rsquo; A strange thought struck me, to try if he knew any thing of an art, or whatever it should be called, which is no doubt very useful in life, but which lies far out of the way of a philosopher and a poet; I mean the trade of a butcher. I enticed him into the subject, by connecting it with the various researches into the manners and customs of uncivilized nations, that have been made by our late navigators into the South Seas. I began with observing, that Mr. (now Sir Joseph) Banks tells us, that the art of slaughtering animals was not known in Otaheité, for, instead of bleeding to death their dogs, (a common food with them,) they strangle them. This he told me himself; and I supposed that their hogs were killed in the same way. Dr. Johnson said, &lsquo;This must be owing to their not having knives, &mdash; though they have sharp stones with which they can cut a carcase in pieces tolerably.&rsquo; By degrees, he shewed that he knew something even of butchery. &lsquo;Different animals (said he) are killed differently. An ox is knocked down, and a calf stunned; but a sheep has its throat cut, without any thing being done to stupify it. The butchers have no view to the ease of the animals, but only to make them quiet, for their own safety and convenience. A sheep can give them little trouble. Hales is of opinion, that every animal should be blooded, without having any blow given to it, because it bleeds better.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;That would be cruel.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;No, Sir; there is not much pain, if the jugular vein be properly cut.&rsquo; Pursuing the subject, he said, the kennels of Southwark ran with blood two or three days in the week; that he was afraid there were slaughter-houses in more streets in London than one supposes; (speaking with a kind of horrour of butchering;) and, yet he added, &lsquo;any of us would kill a cow rather than not have beef.&rsquo; I said we <span class="t8">could</span> not. &lsquo;Yes, (said he,) any one may. The business of a butcher is a trade indeed, that is to say, there is an apprenticeship served to it; but it may be learnt in a month.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I mentioned a club in London at the Boar&rsquo;s Head in Eastcheap, the very tavern where Falstaff and his joyous companions met; the members of which all assume Shakspeare&rsquo;s characters. One is Falstaff, another Prince Henry, another Bardolph, and so on. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be of it, Sir. Now that you have a name, you must be careful to avoid many things, not bad in themselves, but which will lessen your character. This every man who has a name must observe. A man who is not publickly known may live in London as he pleases, without any notice being taken of him; but it is wonderful how a person of any consequence is watched. There was a member of parliament, who wanted to prepare himself to speak on a question that was to come on in the House; and he and I were to talk it over together. He did not wish it should be known that he talked with me; so he would not let me come to his house, but came to mine. Some time after he had made his speech in the house, Mrs. Cholmondeley, a very airy lady, told me, &lsquo;Well, you could make nothing of him!&rsquo; naming the gentleman; which was a proof that he was watched. I had once some business to do for government, and I went to Lord North&rsquo;s. Precaution was taken that it should not be known. It was dark before I went; yet a few days after I was told, &lsquo;Well, you have been with Lord North.&rsquo; That the door of the prime minister should be watched is not strange; but that a member of parliament should be watched, or that my door should be watched, is wonderful.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">We set out this morning on our way to Talisker, in Ulinish&rsquo;s boat, having taken leave of him and his family. Mr. Donald M&rsquo;Queen still favoured us with his company, for which we were much obliged to him. As we sailed along Dr. Johnson got into one of his fits of railing at the Scots. He owned that they had been a very learned nation for a hundred years, from about 1550 to about 1650; but that they afforded the only instance of a people among whom the arts of civil life did not advance in proportion with learning; that they had hardly any trade, any money, or any elegance, before the Union; that it was strange that, with all the advantages possessed by other nations, they had not any of those conveniencies and embellishments which are the fruit of industry, till they came in contact with a civilized people. &lsquo;We have taught you, (said he,) and we&rsquo;ll do the same in time to all barbarous nations, &mdash; to the Cherokees, &mdash; and at last to the Ouran-Outangs;&rsquo; laughing with as much glee as if Monboddo had been present. BOSWELL. &lsquo;We had wine before the Union.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;No, Sir; you had some weak stuff, the refuse of France, which would not make you drunk.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;I assure you, Sir, there was a great deal of drunkenness.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;No, Sir; there were people who died of dropsies, which they contracted in trying to get drunk.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I must here glean some of his conversation at Ulinish, which I have omitted. He repeated his remark, that a man in a ship was worse than a man in a jail. &lsquo;The man in a jail, (said he,) has more room, better food, and commonly better company, and is in safety.&rsquo; &lsquo;Ay; but, (said Mr. M&rsquo;Queen,) the man in the ship has the pleasing hope of getting to shore.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, I am not talking of a man&rsquo;s getting to shore; but of a man while he is in a ship: and then, I say, he is worse than a man while he is in a jail. A man in a jail <span class="t8">may</span> have the <span class="t8">&ldquo;pleasing hope&rdquo;</span> of getting out. A man confined for only a limited time, actually <span class="t8">has</span> it.&rsquo; M&rsquo;Leod mentioned his schemes for carrying on fisheries with spirit, and that he would wish to understand the construction of boats. I suggested that he might go to a dock-yard and work, as Peter the Great did. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Nay, Sir, he need not work. Peter the Great had not the sense to see that the mere mechanical work may be done by any body, and that there is the same art in constructing a vessel, whether the boards are well or ill wrought. Sir Christopher Wren might as well have served his time to a bricklayer, and first, indeed, to a brick-maker.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">There is a beautiful little island in the Loch of Dunvegan, called <span class="t8">Isa</span>. M&rsquo;Leod said, he would give it to Dr. Johnson, on condition of his residing on it three months in the year; nay one month. Dr. Johnson was highly amused with the fancy. I have seen him please himself with little things, even with mere ideas like the present. He talked a great deal of this island; &mdash; how he would build a house there, &mdash; how he would fortify it, &mdash; how he would have cannon, &mdash; how he would plant, &mdash; how he would sally out, and <span class="t8">take</span> the isle of Muck; &mdash; and then he laughed with uncommon glee, and could hardly leave off. I have seen him do so at a small matter that struck him, and was a sport to no one else. Mr. Langton told me, that one night he did so while the company were all grave about him: &mdash; only Garrick, in his significant smart manner, darting his eyes around, exclaimed, &lsquo;<span class="t8">Very</span> jocose, to be sure!&rsquo; M&rsquo;Leod encouraged the fancy of Doctor Johnson&rsquo;s becoming owner of an island; told him, that it was the practice in this country to name every man by his lands; and begged leave to drink to him in that mode: &lsquo;<span class="t8">Island Isa</span>, your health!&rsquo; Ulinish, Talisker, Mr. M&rsquo;Queen, and I, all joined in our different manners, while Dr. Johnson bowed to each, with much good humour.</p>
<p class="p24">We had good weather, and a fine sail this day. The shore was varied with hills, and rocks, and corn-fields, and bushes, which are here dignified with the name of natural <span class="t8">wood</span>. We landed near the house of Ferneley, a farm possessed by another gentleman of the name of M&rsquo;Leod, who, expecting our arrival, was waiting on the shore, with a horse for Dr. Johnson. The rest of us walked. At dinner, I expressed to M&rsquo;Leod the joy which I had in seeing him on such cordial terms with his clan. &lsquo;Government (said he) has deprived us of our ancient power; but it cannot deprive us of our domestick satisfactions. I would rather drink punch in one of their houses, (meaning the houses of his people,) than be enabled by their hardships to have claret in my own.&rsquo; This should be the sentiment of every Chieftain. All that he can get by raising his rents, is more luxury in his own house. Is it not better to share the profits of his estate, to a certain degree, with his kinsmen, and thus have both social intercourse and patriarchal influence?</p>
<p class="p24">We had a very good ride, for about three miles, to Talisker, where Colonel M&rsquo;Leod introduced us to his lady. We found here Mr. Donald M&rsquo;Lean, the young Laird of <span class="t8">Col</span>, (nephew to Talisker,) to whom I delivered the letter with which I had been favoured by his uncle, Professor M&rsquo;Leod, at Aberdeen. He was a little lively young man. We found he had been a good deal in England, studying farming, and was resolved to improve the value of his father&rsquo;s lands, without oppressing his tenants, or losing the ancient Highland fashions.</p>
<p class="p24">Talisker is a better place than one commonly finds in Sky. It is situated in a rich bottom. Before it is a wide expanse of sea, on each hand of which are immense rocks; and, at some distance in the sea, there are three columnal rocks rising to sharp points. The billows break with prodigious force and noise on the coast of Talisker. There are here a good many well-grown trees. Talisker is an extensive farm. The possessor of it has, for several generations, been the next heir to M&rsquo;Leod, as there has been but one son always in that family. The court before the house is most injudiciously paved with the round blueish-grey pebbles which are found upon the sea-shore; so that you walk as if upon cannon-balls driven into the ground.</p>
<p class="p24">After supper, I talked of the assiduity of the Scottish clergy, in visiting and privately instructing their parishioners, and observed how much in this they excelled the English clergy. Dr. Johnson would not let this pass. He tried to turn it off, by saying, &lsquo;There are different ways of instructing. Our clergy pray and preach.&rsquo; M&rsquo;Leod and I pressed the subject, upon which he grew warm, and broke forth: &lsquo;I do not believe your people are better instructed. If they are, it is the blind leading the blind; for your clergy are not instructed themselves.&rsquo; Thinking he had gone a little too far, he checked himself, and added, &lsquo;When I talk of the ignorance of your clergy, I talk of them as a body: I do not mean that there are not individuals who are learned (looking at Mr. M&rsquo;Queen). I suppose there are such among the clergy in Muscovy. The clergy of England have produced the most valuable books in support of religion, both in theory and practice. What have your clergy done, since you sunk into presbyterianism? Can you name one book of any value, on a religious subject, written by them?&rsquo; We were silent. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll help you. Forbes wrote very well; but I believe he wrote before episcopacy was quite extinguished.&rsquo; And then pausing a little, he said, &lsquo;Yes, you have Wishart AGAINST Repentance.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;But, Sir, we are not contending for the superior learning of our clergy, but for their superior assiduity.&rsquo; He bore us down again, with thundering against their ignorance, and said to me, &lsquo;I see you have not been well taught; for you have not charity.&rsquo; He had been in some measure forced into this warmth, by the exulting air which I assumed; for, when he began, he said, &lsquo;Since you <span class="t8">will</span> drive the nail!&rsquo; He again thought of good Mr. M&rsquo;Queen, and, taking him by the hand, said, &lsquo;Sir, I did not mean any disrespect to you.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Here I must observe, that he conquered by deserting his ground, and not meeting the argument as I had put it. The assiduity of the Scottish clergy is certainly greater than that of the English. His taking up the topick of their not having so much learning, was, though ingenious, yet a fallacy in logick. It was as if there should be a dispute whether a man&rsquo;s hair is well dressed, and Dr. Johnson should say, &lsquo;Sir, his hair cannot be well dressed; for he has a dirty shirt. No man who has not clean linen has his hair well dressed.&rsquo; When some days afterwards he read this passage, he said, &lsquo;No, Sir; I did not say that a man&rsquo;s hair could not be well dressed because he has not clean linen, but because he is bald.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He used one argument against the Scottish clergy being learned, which I doubt was not good. &lsquo;As we believe a man dead till we know that he is alive; so we believe men ignorant till we know that they are learned.&rsquo; Now our maxim in law is, to presume a man alive, till we know he is dead. However, indeed, it may be answered, that we must first know he has lived; and that we have never known the learning of the Scottish clergy. Mr. M&rsquo;Queen, though he was of opinion that Dr. Johnson had deserted the point really in dispute, was much pleased with what he said, and owned to me, he thought it very just; and Mrs. M&rsquo;Leod was so much captivated by his eloquence, that she told me &lsquo;I was a good advocate for a bad cause.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 24.</span></p>
<p class="p21">This was a good day. Dr. Johnson told us, at breakfast, that he rode harder at a fox chace than any body. &lsquo;The English (said he) are the only nation who ride hard a-hunting. A Frenchman goes out, upon a managed horse, and capers in the field, and no more thinks of leaping a hedge than of mounting a breach. Lord Powerscourt laid a wager, in France, that he would ride a great many miles in a certain short time. The French academicians set to work, and calculated that, from the resistance of the air, it was impossible. His lordship however performed it.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Our money being nearly exhausted, we sent a bill for thirty pounds, drawn on Sir William Forbes and Co., to Lochbraccadale, but our messenger found it very difficult to procure cash for it; at length, however, he got us value from the master of a vessel which was to carry away some emigrants. There is a great scarcity of specie in Sky. Mr. M&rsquo;Queen said he had the utmost difficulty to pay his servants&rsquo; wages, or to pay for any little thing which he has to buy. The rents are paid in bills, which the drovers give. The people consume a vast deal of snuff and tobacco, for which they must pay ready money; and pedlars, who come about selling goods, as there is not a shop in the island, carry away the cash. If there were encouragement given to fisheries and manufactures, there might be a circulation of money introduced. I got one-and-twenty shillings in silver at Portree, which was thought a wonderful store.</p>
<p class="p24">Talisker, Mr. M&rsquo;Queen, and I, walked out, and looked at no less than fifteen different waterfalls near the house, in the space of about a quarter of a mile. We also saw Cuchillin&rsquo;s well, said to have been the favourite spring of that ancient hero. I drank of it. The water is admirable. On the shore are many stones full of crystallizations in the heart.</p>
<p class="p24">Though our obliging friend, Mr. M&rsquo;Lean, was but the young laird, he had the title of <span class="t8">Col</span> constantly given him. After dinner he and I walked to the top of Prieshwell, a very high rocky hill, from whence there is a view of Barra, &mdash; the Long Island, &mdash; Bernera, &mdash; the Loch of Dunvegan, &mdash; part of Rum &mdash; part of Rasay, and a vast deal of the isle of Sky. Col, though he had come into Sky with an intention to be at Dunvegan, and pass a considerable time in the island, most politely resolved first to conduct us to Mull, and then to return to Sky. This was a very fortunate circumstance; for he planned an expedition for us of more variety than merely going to Mull. He proposed we should see the islands of <span class="t8">Egg, Muck, Col,</span> and <span class="t8">Tyr-yi</span>. In all these islands he could shew us every thing worth seeing; and in Mull he said he should be as if at home, his father having lands there, and he a farm.</p>
<p class="p24">Dr. Johnson did not talk much to-day, but seemed intent in listening to the schemes of future excursion, planned by Col. Dr. Birch, however, being mentioned, he said, he had more anecdotes than any man. I said, Percy had a great many; that he flowed with them like one of the brooks here. JOHNSON. &lsquo;If Percy is like one of the brooks here, Birch was like the river Thames. Birch excelled Percy in that, as much as Percy excels Goldsmith.&rsquo; I mentioned Lord Hailes as a man of anecdote. He was not pleased with him, for publishing only such memorials and letters as were unfavourable for the Stuart family. &lsquo;If, (said he,) a man fairly warns you, &ldquo;I am to give all the ill; do you find the good;&rdquo; he may: but if the object which he professes be to give a view of a reign, let him tell all the truth. I would tell truth of the two Georges, or of that scoundrel, King William. Granger&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Biographical History</span> is full of curious anecdote, but might have been better done. The dog is a Whig. I do not like much to see a Whig in any dress; but I hate to see a Whig in a parson&rsquo;s gown.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 25.</span></p>
<p class="p21">It was resolved that we should set out, in order to return to Slate, to be in readiness to take boat whenever there should be a fair wind. Dr. Johnson remained in his chamber writing a letter, and it was long before we could get him into motion. He did not come to breakfast, but had it sent to him. When he had finished his letter, it was twelve o&rsquo;clock, and we should have set out at ten. When I went up to him, he said to me, &lsquo;Do you remember a song which begins, </p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Every island is a prison</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strongly guarded by the sea;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kings and princes, for that reason,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prisoners are, as well as we?&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I suppose he had been thinking of our confined situation. He would fain have gone in a boat from hence, instead of riding back to Slate. A scheme for it was proposed. He said, &lsquo;We&rsquo;ll not be driven tamely from it:&rsquo;-but it proved impracticable.</p>
<p class="p24">We took leave of M&rsquo;Leod and Talisker, from whom we parted with regret. Talisker, having been bred to physick, had a tincture of scholarship in his conversation, which pleased Dr. Johnson, and he had some very good books; and being a colonel in the Dutch service, he and his lady, in consequence of having lived abroad, had introduced the ease and politeness of the continent into this rude region.</p>
<p class="p24">Young Col was now our leader. Mr. M&rsquo;Queen was to accompany us half a day more. We stopped at a little hut, where we saw an old woman grinding with the <span class="t8">quern</span>, the ancient Highland instrument, which it is said was used by the Romans, but which, being very slow in its operation, is almost entirely gone into disuse.</p>
<p class="p24">The walls of the cottages in Sky, instead of being one compacted mass of stones, are often formed by two exterior surfaces of stone, filled up with earth in the middle, which makes them very warm. The roof is generally bad. They are thatched, sometimes with straw, sometimes with heath, sometimes with fern. The thatch is secured by ropes of straw, or of heath; and, to fix the ropes, there is a stone tied to the end of each. These stones hang round the bottom of the roof, and make it look like a lady&rsquo;s hair in papers; but I should think that, when there is wind, they would come down, and knock people on the head.</p>
<p class="p24">We dined at the inn at Sconser, where I had the pleasure to find a letter from my wife. Here we parted from our learned companion, Mr. Donald M&rsquo;Queen. Dr. Johnson took leave of him very affectionately, saying, &lsquo;Dear Sir, do not forget me!&rsquo; We settled, that he should write an account of the Isle of Sky, which Dr. Johnson promised to revise. He said, Mr. M&rsquo;Queen should tell all that he could; distinguishing what he himself knew, what was traditional, and what conjectural.</p>
<p class="p24">We sent our horses round a point of land, that we might shun some very bad road; and resolved to go forward by sea. It was seven o&rsquo;clock when we got into our boat. We had many showers, and it soon grew pretty dark. Dr. Johnson sat silent and patient. Once he said, as he looked on the black coast of Sky,-black, as being composed of rocks seen in the dusk,&mdash; &lsquo;This is very solemn.&rsquo; Our boatmen were rude singers, and seemed so like wild Indians, that a very little imagination was necessary to give one an impression of being upon an American river. We landed at <span class="t8">Strolimus</span>, from whence we got a guide to walk before us, for two miles, to <span class="t8">Corrichatachin</span>. Not being able to procure a horse for our baggage, I took one portmanteau before me, and Joseph another. We had but a single star to light us on our way. It was about eleven when we arrived. We were most hospitably received by the master and mistress, who were just going to bed, but, with unaffected ready kindness, made a good fire, and at twelve o&rsquo;clock at night had supper on the table.</p>
<p class="p24">James Macdonald, of <span class="t8">Knockow</span>, Kingsburgh&rsquo;s brother, whom we had seen at Kingsburgh, was there. He shewed me a bond granted by the late Sir James Macdonald, to old Kingsburgh, the preamble of which does so much honour to the feelings of that much-lamented gentleman, that I thought it worth transcribing. It was as follows: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I, Sir James Macdonald, of Macdonald, Baronet, now, after arriving at my perfect age, from the friendship I bear to Alexander Macdonald of Kingsburgh, and in return for the long and faithful services done and performed by him to my deceased father, and to myself during my minority, when he was one of my Tutors and Curators; being resolved, now that the said Alexander Macdonald is advanced in years, to contribute my endeavours for making his old age placid and comfortable,&rsquo; &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">therefore he grants him an annuity of fifty pounds sterling.</p>
<p class="p24">Dr. Johnson went to bed soon. When one bowl of punch was finished, I rose, and was near the door, in my way up stairs to bed; but Corrichatachin said, it was the first time Col had been in his house, and he should have his bowl;-and would not I join in drinking it? The heartiness of my honest landlord, and the desire of doing social honour to our very obliging conductor, induced me to sit down again. Col&rsquo;s bowl was finished; and by that time we were well warmed. A third bowl was soon made, and that too was finished. We were cordial, and merry to a high degree; but of what passed I have no recollection, with any accuracy. I remember calling <span class="t8">Corrichatachin</span> by the familiar appellation of <span class="t8">Corri</span>, which his friends do. A fourth bowl was made, by which time Col, and young M&rsquo;Kinnon, Corrichatachin&rsquo;s son, slipped away to bed. I continued a little with Corri and Knockow; but at last I left them. It was near five in the morning when I got to bed.</p>

<p class="p10"><span class="t4">SUNDAY, SEPTEMBER 26</span></p>
<p class="p21">I awaked at noon, with a severe head-ach. I was much vexed that I should have been guilty of such a riot, and afraid of a reproof from Dr. Johnson. I thought it very inconsistent with that conduct which I ought to maintain, while the companion of the Rambler. About one he came into my room, and accosted me, &lsquo;What, drunk yet?&rsquo; His tone of voice was not that of severe upbraiding; so I was relieved a little. &lsquo;Sir, (said I,) they kept me up.&rsquo; He answered, &lsquo;No, you kept them up, you drunken dog:&rsquo;-This he said with good-humoured <span class="t8">English</span> pleasantry. Soon afterwards, Corrichatachin, Col, and other friends assembled round my bed. Corri had a brandy-bottle and glass with him, and insisted I should take a dram. &lsquo;Ay, said Dr. Johnson, fill him drunk again. Do it in the morning, that we may laugh at him all day. It is a poor thing for a fellow to get drunk at night, and sculk to bed, and let his friends have no sport.&rsquo; Finding him thus jocular, I became quite easy; and when I offered to get up, he very good naturedly said, &lsquo;You need be in no such hurry now.&rsquo; I took my host&rsquo;s advice, and drank some brandy, which I found an effectual cure for my head-ach. When I rose, I went into Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s room, and taking up Mrs. M&rsquo;Kinnon&rsquo;s Prayer-book, I opened it at the twentieth Sunday after Trinity, in the epistle for which I read, &lsquo;And be not drunk with wine, wherein there is excess.&rsquo; Some would have taken this as a divine interposition.</p>
<p class="p24">Mrs. M&rsquo;Kinnon told us at dinner, that old Kingsburgh, her father, was examined at Mugstot, by General Campbell, as to the particulars of the dress of the person who had come to his house in woman&rsquo;s clothes along with Miss Flora M&rsquo;Donald; as the General had received intelligence of that disguise. The particulars were taken down in writing, that it might be seen how far they agreed with the dress of the <span class="t8">Irish girl</span> who went with Miss Flora from the Long Island. Kingsburgh, she said, had but one song, which he always sung when he was merry over a glass. She dictated the words to me, which are foolish enough: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Green sleeves and pudding pies,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tell me where my mistress lies,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I&rsquo;ll be with her before she rise,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fiddle and aw&rsquo; together.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May our affairs abroad succeed,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And may our king come home with speed,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all pretenders shake for dread,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And let <span class="t8">his</span> health go round.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To all our injured friends in need,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This side and beyond the Tweed! &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let all pretenders shake for dread,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And let <span class="t8">his</span> health go round.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green sleeves,&rsquo; &amp;c.</p>
<p class="p24">While the examination was going on, the present Talisker, who was there as one of M&rsquo;Leod&rsquo;s militia, could not resist the pleasantry of asking Kingsburgh, in allusion to his only song, &lsquo;Had she <span class="t8">green sleeves</span>?&rsquo; Kingsburgh gave him no answer. Lady Margaret M&rsquo;Donald was very angry at Talisker for joking on such a serious occasion, as Kingsburgh was really in danger of his life. Mrs. M&rsquo;Kinnon added that Lady Margaret was quite adored in Sky. That when she travelled through the island, the people ran in crowds before her, and took the stones off the road, lest her horse should stumble and she be hurt. Her husband, Sir Alexander, is also remembered with great regard. We were told that every week a hogshead of claret was drunk at his table.</p>
<p class="p24">This was another day of wind and rain; but good cheer and good society helped to beguile the time. I felt myself comfortable enough in the afternoon. I then thought that my last night&rsquo;s riot was no more than such a social excess as may happen without much moral blame; and recollected that some physicians maintained, that a fever produced by it was, upon the whole, good for health: so different are our reflections on the same subject, at different periods; and such the excuses with which we palliate what we know to be wrong.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 27.</span></p>
<p class="p21">Mr. Donald M&rsquo;Leod, our original guide, who had parted from us at Dunvegan, joined us again to-day. The weather was still so bad that we could not travel. I found a closet here, with a good many books, beside those that were lying about. Dr. Johnson told me, he found a library in his room at Talisker; and observed, that it was one of the remarkable things of Sky, that there were so many books in it.</p>
<p class="p24">Though we had here great abundance of provisions, it is remarkable that Corrichatachin has literally no garden: not even a turnip, a carrot, or a cabbage. After dinner, we talked of the crooked spade used in Sky, already described, and they maintained that it was better than the usual garden-spade, and that there was an art in tossing it, by which those who were accustomed to it could work very easily with it. &lsquo;Nay, (said Dr. Johnson,) it may be useful in land where there are many stones to raise; but it certainly is not a good instrument for digging good land. A man may toss it, to be sure; but he will toss a light spade much better: its weight makes it an incumbrance. A man <span class="t8">may</span> dig any land with it; but he has no occasion for such a weight in digging good land. You may take a field piece to shoot sparrows; but all the sparrows you can bring home will not be worth the charge.&rsquo; He was quite social and easy amongst them; and, though he drank no fermented liquor, toasted Highland beauties with great readiness. His conviviality engaged them so much, that they seemed eager to shew their attention to him, and vied with each other in crying out, with a strong Celtick pronunciation, &lsquo;Toctor Shonson, Toctor Shonson, your health!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">This evening one of our married ladies, a lively pretty little woman, good-humouredly sat down upon Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s knee, and, being encouraged by some of the company, put her hands round his neck, and kissed him. &lsquo;Do it again, (said he,) and let us see who will tire first.&rsquo; He kept her on his knee some time, while he and she drank tea. He was now like a <span class="t8">buck</span> indeed. All the company were much entertained to find him so easy and pleasant. To me it was highly comick, to see the grave philosopher, &mdash; the Rambler,-toying with a Highland beauty! &mdash; But what could he do? He must have been surly, and weak too, had he not behaved as he did. He would have been laughed at, and not more respected, though less loved.</p>
<p class="p24">He read to-night, to himself, as he sat in company, a great deal of my Journal, and said to me, &lsquo;The more I read of this, I think the more highly of you.&rsquo; The gentlemen sat a long time at their punch, after he and I had retired to our chambers. The manner in which they were attended struck me as singular: &mdash; The bell being broken, a smart lad lay on a table in the corner of the room, ready to spring up and bring the kettle, whenever it was wanted. They continued drinking, and singing Erse songs, till near five in the morning, when they all came into my room, where some of them had beds. Unluckily for me, they found a bottle of punch in a corner, which they drank; and Corrichatachin went for another, which they also drank. They made many apologies for disturbing me. I told them, that, having been kept awake by their mirth, I had once thoughts of getting up, and joining them again. Honest Corrichatachin said, &lsquo;To have had you done so, I would have given a cow.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 28.</span></p>
<p class="p21">The weather was worse than yesterday. I felt as if imprisoned. Dr. Johnson said, it was irksome to be detained thus: yet he seemed to have less uneasiness, or more patience, than I had. What made our situation worse here was, that we had no rooms that we could command; for the good people had no notion that a man could have any occasion but for a mere sleeping-place; so, during the day, the bed chambers were common to all the house. Servants eat in Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s; and mine was a kind of general rendezvous of all under the roof, children and dogs not excepted. As the gentlemen occupied the parlour, the ladies had no place to sit in, during the day, but Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s room. I had always some quiet time for writing in it, before he was up; and, by degrees, I accustomed the ladies to let me sit in it after breakfast, at my <span class="t8">Journal</span>, without minding me.</p>
<p class="p24">Dr. Johnson was this morning for going to see as many islands as we could; not recollecting the uncertainty of the season, which might detain us in one place for many weeks. He said to me, &lsquo;I have more the spirit of adventure than you.&rsquo; For my part, I was anxious to get to Mull, from whence we might almost any day reach the main land.</p>
<p class="p24">Dr. Johnson mentioned, that the few ancient Irish gentlemen yet remaining have the highest pride of family; that Mr. Sandford, a friend of his, whose mother was Irish, told him, that O&rsquo;Hara (who was true Irish, both by father and mother) and he, and Mr. Ponsonby, son to the Earl of Besborough, the greatest man of the three, but of an English family, went to see one of those ancient Irish, and that he distinguished them thus: &lsquo;O&rsquo;Hara, you are welcome! Mr. Sandford, your mother&rsquo;s son is welcome! Mr. Ponsonby, you may sit down.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He talked both of threshing and thatching. He said, it was very difficult to determine how to agree with a thresher. &lsquo;If you pay him by the day&rsquo;s wages, he will thresh no more than he pleases; though to be sure, the negligence of a thresher is more easily detected than that of most labourers, because he must always make a sound while he works. If you pay him by the piece, by the quantity of grain which he produces, he will thresh only while the grain comes freely, and, though he leaves a good deal in the ear, it is not worth while to thresh the straw over again; nor can you fix him to do it sufficiently, because it is so difficult to prove how much less a man threshes than he ought to do. Here then is a dilemma: but, for my part, I would engage him by the day: I would rather trust his idleness than his fraud.&rsquo; He said, a roof thatched with Lincolnshire reeds would last seventy years, as he was informed when in that county; and that he told this in London to a great thatcher, who said, he believed it might be true. Such are the pains that Dr. Johnson takes to get the best information on every subject.</p>
<p class="p24">He proceeded:&mdash; &lsquo;It is difficult for a farmer in England to find day-labourers, because the lowest manufacturers can always get more than a day-labourer. It is of no consequence how high the wages of manufacturers are; but it would be of very bad consequence to raise the wages of those who procure the immediate necessaries of life, for that would raise the price of provisions. Here then is a problem for politicians. It is not reasonable that the most useful body of men should be the worst paid; yet it does not appear how it can be ordered otherwise. It were to be wished, that a mode for its being otherwise were found out. In the mean time, it is better to give temporary assistance by charitable contributions to poor labourers, at times when provisions are high, than to raise their wages; because, if wages are once raised, they will never get down again.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Happily the weather cleared up between one and two o&rsquo;clock, and we got ready to depart; but our kind host and hostess would not let us go without taking a <span class="t8">snatch</span>, as they called it; which was in truth a very good dinner. While the punch went round, Dr. Johnson kept a close whispering conference with Mrs. M&rsquo;Kinnon, which, however, was loud enough to let us hear that the subject of it was the particulars of Prince Charles&rsquo;s escape. The company were entertained and pleased to observe it. Upon that subject, there was something congenial between the soul of Dr. Samuel Johnson, and that of an isle of Sky farmer&rsquo;s wife. It is curious to see people, how far so ever removed from each other in the general system of their lives, come close together on a particular point which is common to each. We were merry with Corrichatachin, on Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s whispering with his wife. She, perceiving this, humourously cried, &lsquo;I am in love with him. What is it to live and not to love?&rsquo; Upon her saying something, which I did not hear, or cannot recollect, he seized her hand eagerly, and kissed it.</p>
<p class="p24">As we were going, the Scottish phrase of &lsquo;<span class="t8">honest man</span>!&rsquo; which is an expression of kindness and regard, was again and again applied by the company to Dr. Johnson. I was also treated with much civility; and I must take some merit from my assiduous attention to him, and from my contriving that he shall be easy wherever he goes, that he shall not be asked twice to eat or drink any thing (which always disgusts him), that he shall be provided with water at his meals, and many such little things, which, if not attended to, would fret him. I also may be allowed to claim some merit in leading the conversation: I do not mean leading, as in an orchestra, by playing the first fiddle; but leading as one does in examining a witness &mdash; starting topics, and making him pursue them. He appears to me like a great mill, into which a subject is thrown to be ground. It requires, indeed, fertile minds to furnish materials for this mill. I regret whenever I see it unemployed; but sometimes I feel myself quite barren, and have nothing to throw in. I know not if this mill be a good figure; though Pope makes his mind a mill for turning verses.</p>
<p class="p24">We set out about four. Young Corrichatachin went with us. We had a fine evening, and arrived in good time at <span class="t8">Ostig</span>, the residence of Mr. Martin M&rsquo;Pherson, minister of Slate. It is a pretty good house, built by his father, upon a farm near the church. We were received here with much kindness by Mr. and Mrs. M&rsquo;Pherson, and his sister, Miss M&rsquo;Pherson, who pleased Dr. Johnson much, by singing Erse songs, and playing on the guittar. He afterwards sent her a present of his <span class="t8">Rasselas</span>. In his bed-chamber was a press stored with books, Greek, Latin, French, and English, most of which had belonged to the father of our host, the learned Dr. M&rsquo;Pherson; who, though his <span class="t8">Dissertations</span> have been mentioned in a former page as unsatisfactory, was a man of distinguished talents. Dr. Johnson looked at a Latin paraphrase of the song of Moses, written by him, and published in the <span class="t8">Scots Magazine</span> for 1747, and said, &lsquo;It does him honour; he has a good deal of Latin, and good Latin.&rsquo; Dr. M&rsquo;Pherson published also in the same magazine, June 1739, an original Latin ode, which he wrote from the isle of Barra, where he was minister for some years. It is very poetical, and exhibits a striking proof how much all things depend upon comparison: for Barra, it seems, appeared to him so much worse than Sky, his <span class="t8">natale solum</span>, that he languished for its &lsquo;blessed mountains,&rsquo; and thought himself buried alive amongst barbarians where he was. My readers will probably not be displeased to have a specimen of this ode: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Hei mihi! quantos patior dolores,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dum procul specto juga ter beata;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dum ferae Barrae steriles arenas</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Solus oberro.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Ingemo, indignor, crucior, quod inter</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Barbaros Thulen lateam colentes;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Torpeo languens, morior sepultus,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carcere coeco.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">After wishing for wings to fly over to his dear country, which was in his view, from what he calls <span class="t8">Thule</span>, as being the most western isle of Scotland, except St. Kilda; after describing the pleasures of society, and the miseries of solitude, he at last, with becoming propriety, has recourse to the only sure relief of thinking men, &mdash; <span class="t8">Sursum corda</span> &mdash; the hope of a better world, disposes his mind to resignation: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Interim fiat, tua, rex, voluntas:</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Erigor sursum quoties subit spes</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certa migrandi Solymam supernam,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Numinis aulam.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He concludes in a noble strain of orthodox piety: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Vita tum demum vocitanda vita est.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tum licet gratos socios habere,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seraphim et sanctos TRIADEM verendam</p>
<p class="p24"><a id="a2666"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concelebrantes.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 29.</span></p>
<p class="p21">After a very good sleep, I rose more refreshed than I had been for some nights. We were now at but a little distance from the shore, and saw the sea from our windows, which made our voyage seem nearer. Mr. M&rsquo;Pherson&rsquo;s manners and address pleased us much. He appeared to be a man of such intelligence and taste as to be sensible of the extraordinary powers of his illustrious guest. He said to me, &lsquo;Dr. Johnson is an honour to mankind; and, if the expression may be used, is an honour to religion.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Col, who had gone yesterday to pay a visit at Camuscross, joined us this morning at breakfast. Some other gentlemen also came to enjoy the entertainment of Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s conversation. The day was windy and rainy, so that we had just seized a happy interval for our journey last night. We had good entertainment here, better accommodation than at Corrichatachin, and time enough to ourselves. The hours slipped along imperceptibly. We talked of Shenstone. Dr. Johnson said he was a good layer-out of land, but would not allow him to approach excellence as a poet. He said, he believed he had tried to read all his <span class="t8">Love Pastorals</span>, but did not get through them. I repeated the stanza, </p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;She gazed as I slowly withdrew;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My path I could hardly discern;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So sweetly she bade me adieu,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought that she bade me return.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He said, &lsquo;That seems to be pretty.&rsquo; I observed that Shenstone, from his short maxims in prose, appeared to have some power of thinking; but Dr. Johnson would not allow him that merit. He agreed, however, with Shenstone, that it was wrong in the brother of one of his correspondents to burn his letters: &lsquo;for, (said he,) Shenstone was a man whose correspondence was an honour.&rsquo; He was this afternoon full of critical severity, and dealt about his censures on all sides. He said, Hammond&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Love Elegies</span> were poor things. He spoke contemptuously of our lively and elegant, though too licentious, Lyrick bard, Hanbury Williams, and said, &lsquo;he had no fame, but from boys who drank with him.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">While he was in this mood, I was unfortunate enough, simply perhaps, but I could not help thinking, undeservedly, to come within &lsquo;the whiff and wind of his fell sword.&rsquo; I asked him, if he had ever been accustomed to wear a night-cap. He said &lsquo;No.&rsquo; I asked, if it was best not to wear one. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, I had this custom by chance, and perhaps no man shall ever know whether it is best to sleep with or without a night-cap.&rsquo; Soon afterwards he was laughing at some deficiency in the Highlands, and said, &lsquo;One might as well go without shoes and stockings.&rsquo; Thinking to have a little hit at his own deficiency, I ventured to add, &mdash;&mdash; &mdash; &lsquo; or without a night-cap, Sir.&rsquo; But I had better have been silent; for he retorted directly. &lsquo;I do not see the connection there (laughing). Nobody before was ever foolish enough to ask whether it was best to wear a night-cap or not. This comes of being a little wrong-headed.&rsquo; He carried the company along with him: and yet the truth is, that if he had always worn a night-cap, as is the common practice, and found the Highlanders did not wear one, he would have wondered at their barbarity; so that my hit was fair enough.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 30.</span></p>
<p class="p21">There was as great a storm of wind and rain as I have almost ever seen, which necessarily confined us to the house; but we were fully compensated by Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s conversation. He said, he did not grudge Burke&rsquo;s being the first man in the House of Commons, for he was the first man every where; but he grudged that a fellow who makes no figure in company, and has a mind as narrow as the neck of a vinegar cruet, should make a figure in the House of Commons, merely by having the knowledge of a few forms, and being furnished with a little occasional information. He told us, the first time he saw Dr. Young was at the house of Mr. Richardson, the author of <span class="t8">Clarissa</span>. He was sent for, that the doctor might read to him his <span class="t8">Conjectures on original Composition</span>, which he did, and Dr. Johnson made his remarks; and he was surprized to find Young receive as novelties, what he thought very common maxims. He said, he believed Young was not a great scholar, nor had studied regularly the art of writing; that there were very fine things in his <span class="t8">Night Thoughts</span>, though you could not find twenty lines together without some extravagance. He repeated two passages from his <span class="t8">Love of Fame</span>, &mdash; the characters of Brunetta and Stella, which he praised highly. He said Young pressed him much to come to Wellwyn. He always intended it, but never went. He was sorry when Young died. The cause of quarrel between Young and his son, he told us, was, that his son insisted Young should turn away a clergyman&rsquo;s widow, who lived with him, and who, having acquired great influence over the father, was saucy to the son. Dr. Johnson said, she could not conceal her resentment at him, for saying to Young, that &lsquo;an old man should not resign himself to the management of any body.&rsquo; I asked him, if there was any improper connection between them. &lsquo;No, Sir, no more than between two statues. He was past fourscore, and she a very coarse woman. She read to him, and I suppose made his coffee, and frothed his chocolate, and did such things as an old man wishes to have done for him.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Dr. Doddridge being mentioned, he observed that &lsquo;he was author of one of the finest epigrams in the English language. It is in Orton&rsquo;s Life of him. The subject is his family motto, &mdash; <span class="t8">Dum vivimus, vivamus</span>; which, in its primary signification, is, to be sure, not very suitable to a Christian divine; but he paraphrased it thus: </p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Live, while you live, the <span class="t8">epicure</span> would say,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And seize the pleasures of the present day.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Live, while you live, the sacred <span class="t8">preacher</span> cries,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And give to GOD each moment as it flies.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord, in my views let both united be;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I live in <span class="t8">pleasure</span>, when I live to <span class="t8">thee</span>.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I asked if it was not strange that government should permit so many infidel writings to pass without censure. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, it is mighty foolish. It is for want of knowing their own power. The present family on the throne came to the crown against the will of nine tenths of the people. Whether those nine tenths were right or wrong, it is not our business now to enquire. But such being the situation of the royal family, they were glad to encourage all who would be their friends. Now you know every bad man is a Whig; every man who has loose notions. The church was all against this family. They were, as I say, glad to encourage any friends; and therefore, since their accession, there is no instance of any man being kept back on account of his bad principles; and hence this inundation of impiety.&rsquo; I observed that Mr. Hume, some of whose writings were very unfavourable to religion, was, however, a Tory. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, Hume is a Tory by chance as being a Scotchman; but not upon a principle of duty; for he has no principle. If he is any thing, he is a Hobbist.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">There was something not quite serene in his humour to-night, after supper; for he spoke of hastening away to London, without stopping much at Edinburgh. I reminded him that he had General Oughton and many others to see. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Nay, I shall neither go in jest, nor stay in jest. I shall do what is fit.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Ay, Sir, but all I desire is, that you will let me tell you when it is fit.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, I shall not consult you.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;If you are to run away from us, as soon as you get loose, we will keep you confined in an island.&rsquo; He was, however, on the whole, very good company. Mr. Donald McLeod expressed very well the gradual impression made by Dr. Johnson on those who are so fortunate as to obtain his acquaintance. &lsquo;When you see him first, you are struck with awful reverence; &mdash; then you admire him; &mdash; and then you love him cordially.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I read this evening some part of Voltaire&rsquo;s <span class="t8">History of the War</span> in 1741, and of Lord Kames against Hereditary Indefeasible Right. This is a very slight circumstance, with which I should not trouble my reader, but for the sake of observing that every man should keep minutes of whatever he reads. Every circumstance of his studies should be recorded; what books he has consulted; how much of them he has read; at what times; how often the same authors; and what opinions he formed of them, at different periods of his life. Such an account would much illustrate the history of his mind.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">FRIDAY, OCTOBER 1.</span></p>
<p class="p21">I shewed to Dr. Johnson verses in a magazine, on his <span class="t8">Dictionary</span>, composed of uncommon words taken from it: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Little of <span class="t8">Anthropopathy</span> has he,&rsquo; &amp;c.</p>
<p class="p24">He read a few of them, and said, &lsquo;I am not answerable for all the words in my <span class="t8">Dictionary</span>&rsquo;. I told him that Garrick kept a book of all who had either praised or abused him. On the subject of his own reputation, he said,&rsquo; Now that I see it has been so current a topick, I wish I had done so too; but it could not well be done now, as so many things are scattered in newspapers.&rsquo; He said he was angry at a boy of Oxford, who wrote in his defence against Kenrick; because it was doing him hurt to answer Kenrick. He was told afterwards, the boy was to come to him to ask a favour. He first thought to treat him rudely, on account of his meddling in that business; but then he considered, he had meant to do him all the service in his power, and he took another resolution; he told him he would do what he could for him, and did so; and the boy was satisfied. He said, he did not know how his pamphlet was done, as he had &lsquo;read very little of it. The boy made a good figure at Oxford, but died. He remarked, that attacks on authors did them much service. &lsquo;A man who tells me my play is very bad, is less my enemy than he who lets it die in silence. A man whose business it is to be talked of, is much helped by being attacked.&rsquo; Garrick, I observed, had been often so helped. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Yes, Sir; though Garrick had more opportunities than almost any man, to keep the publick in mind of him, by exhibiting himself to such numbers, he would not have had so much reputation, had he not been so much attacked. Every attack produces a defence; and so attention is engaged. There is no sport in mere praise, when people are all of a mind.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Then Hume is not the worse for Beattie&rsquo;s attack?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;He is, because Beattie has confuted him. I do not say, but that there may be some attacks which will hurt an author. Though Hume suffered from Beattie, he was the better for other attacks.&rsquo; (He certainly could not include in that number those of Dr. Adams, and Mr. Tytler.) BOSWELL. &lsquo;Goldsmith is the better for attacks.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Yes, Sir; but he does not think so yet. When Goldsmith and I published, each of us something, at the same time, we were given to understand that we might review each other. Goldsmith was for accepting the offer. I said, No; set Reviewers at defiance. It was said to old Bentley, upon the attacks against him, &ldquo;Why, they&rsquo;ll write you down.&rdquo; &ldquo;No, Sir,&rdquo; he replied; &ldquo;depend upon it, no man was ever written down but by himself.&rdquo; &lsquo;He observed to me afterwards, that the advantages authors derived from attacks, were chiefly in subjects of taste, where you cannot confute, as so much may be said on either side. He told me he did not know who was the authour of the <span class="t8">Adventures of a Guinea</span>, but that the bookseller had sent the first volume to him in manuscript, to have his opinion if it should be printed; and he thought it should.</p>
<p class="p24">The weather being now somewhat better, Mr. James McDonald, factor to Sir Alexander McDonald in Slate, insisted that all the company at Ostig should go to the house at Armidale, which Sir Alexander had left, having gone with his lady to Edinburgh, and be his guests, till we had an opportunity of sailing to Mull. We accordingly got there to dinner; and passed our day very cheerfully, being no less than fourteen in number.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">SATURDAY, OCTOBER 2.</span></p>
<p class="p21">Dr. Johnson said, that &lsquo;a Chief and his Lady should make their house like a court. They should have a certain number of the gentlemen&rsquo;s daughters to receive their education in the family, to learn pastry and such things from the housekeeper, and manners from my lady. That was the way in the great families in Wales; at Lady Salisbury&rsquo;s, Mrs. Thrale&rsquo;s grandmother, and at Lady Philips&rsquo;s. I distinguish the families by the ladies, as I speak of what was properly their province. There were always six young ladies at Sir John Philips&rsquo;s: when one was married, her place was filled up. There was a large school-room, where they learnt needle-work and other things.&rsquo; I observed, that, at some courts in Germany, there were academies for the pages, who are the sons of gentlemen, and receive their education without any expence to their parents. Dr. Johnson said, that manners were best learned at those courts.&rsquo; You are admitted with great facility to the prince&rsquo;s company, and yet must treat him with much respect. At a great court, you are at such a distance that you get no good.&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;Very true: a man sees the court of Versailles, as if he saw it on a theatre.&rsquo; He said, &lsquo;The best book that ever was written upon good breeding, <span class="t8">Il Corteggiano</span>, by Castiglione, grew up at the little court of Urbino, and you should read it.&rsquo; I am glad always to have his opinion of books. At Mr. McPherson&rsquo;s, he commended Whitby&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Commentary</span>, and said, he had heard him called rather lax; but he did not perceive it. He had looked at a novel, called <span class="t8">The Man of the World</span>, at Rasay, but thought there was nothing in it. He said to-day, while reading my <span class="t8">Journal</span>, &lsquo;This will be a great treasure to us some years hence.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Talking of a very penurious gentleman of our acquaintance, he observed, that he exceeded <span class="t8">L&rsquo;Avare</span> in the play. I concurred with him, and remarked that he would do well, if introduced in one of Foote&rsquo;s farces; that the best way to get it done, would be to bring Foote to be entertained at his house for a week, and then it would be <span class="t8">facit indignatio</span>. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, I wish he had him. I, who have eaten his bread, will not give him to him; but I should be glad he came honestly by him.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He said, he was angry at Thrale, for sitting at General Oglethorpe&rsquo;s without speaking. He censured a man for degrading himself to a non-entity. I observed, that Goldsmith was on the other extreme; for he spoke at all ventures. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Yes, Sir; Goldsmith, rather than not speak, will talk of what he knows himself to be ignorant, which can only end in exposing him.&rsquo; &lsquo;I wonder, (said I,) if he feels that he exposes himself. If he was with two taylors,&rsquo; &lsquo;Or with two founders, (said Dr. Johnson, interrupting me,) he would fall a talking on the method of making cannon, though both of them would soon see that he did not know what metal a cannon is made of.&rsquo; We were very social and merry in his room this forenoon. In the evening the company danced as usual. We performed, with much activity, a dance which, I suppose, the emigration from Sky has occasioned. They call it <span class="t8">America</span>. Each of the couples, after the common <span class="t8">involutions</span> and <span class="t8">evolutions</span>, successively whirls round in a circle, till all are in motion; and the dance seems intended to shew how emigration catches, till a whole neighbourhood is set afloat. Mrs. M&rsquo;Kinnon told me, that last year when a ship sailed from Portree for America, the people on shore were almost distracted when they saw their relations go off, they lay down on the ground, tumbled, and tore the grass with their teeth. This year there was not a tear shed. The people on shore seemed to think that they would soon follow. This indifference is a mortal sign for the country.</p>
<p class="p24">We danced to-night to the musick of the bagpipe, which made us beat the ground with prodigious force. I thought it better to endeavour to conciliate the kindness of the people of Sky, by joining heartily in their amusements, than to play the abstract scholar. I looked on this Tour to the Hebrides as a copartnership between Dr. Johnson and me. Each was to do all he could to promote its success; and I have some reason to flatter myself, that my gayer exertions were of service to us. Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s immense fund of knowledge and wit was a wonderful source of admiration and delight to them; but they had it only at times; and they required to have the intervals agreeably filled up, and even little elucidations of his learned text. I was also fortunate enough frequently to draw him forth to talk, when he would otherwise have been silent. The fountain was at times locked up, till I opened the spring. It was curious to hear the Hebridians, when any dispute happened while he was out of the room, saying, &lsquo;Stay till Dr. Johnson comes: say that to <span class="t8">him!</span></p>
<p class="p24">Yesterday, Dr. Johnson said, &lsquo;I cannot but laugh, to think of myself roving among the Hebrides at sixty. I wonder where I shall rove at fourscore!&rsquo; This evening he disputed the truth of what is said, as to the people of St. Kilda catching cold whenever strangers come. &lsquo;How can there (said he) be a physical effect without a physical cause?&rsquo; He added, laughing, &lsquo;the arrival of a ship full of strangers would kill them; for, if one stranger gives them one cold, two strangers must give them two colds; and so in proportion.&rsquo; I wondered to hear him ridicule this, as he had praised M&rsquo;Aulay for putting it in his book: saying, that it was manly in him to tell a fact, however strange, if he himself believed it. He said, the evidence was not adequate to the improbability of the thing; that if a physician, rather disposed to be incredulous, should go to St. Kilda, and report the fact, then he would begin to look about him. They said, it was annually proved by M&rsquo;Leod&rsquo;s steward, on whose arrival all the inhabitants caught cold. He jocularly remarked, &lsquo;the steward always comes to demand something from them; and so they fall a coughing. I suppose the people in Sky all take a cold, when &mdash; (naming a certain person) comes.&rsquo; They said, he came only in summer. JOHNSON. &lsquo;That is out of tenderness to you. Bad weather and he, at the same time, would be too much.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">SUNDAY, OCTOBER 3.</span></p>
<p class="p21">Joseph reported that the wind was still against us. Dr. Johnson said, &lsquo;A wind, or not a wind? that is the question;&rsquo; for he can amuse himself at times with a little play of words, or rather sentences. I remember when he turned his cup at Aberbrothick, where we drank tea, he muttered <span class="t8">Claudite jam rivos, pueri&rsquo;</span>. I must again and again apologize to fastidious readers, for recording such minute particulars. They prove the scrupulous fidelity of my <span class="t8">Journal</span>. Dr. Johnson said it was a very exact picture of a portion of his life.</p>
<p class="p24">While we were chatting in the indolent stile of men who were to stay here all this day at least, we were suddenly roused at being told that the wind was fair, that a little fleet of herring-busses was passing by for Mull, and that Mr. Simpson&rsquo;s vessel was about to sail. Hugh M&rsquo;Donald, the skipper, came to us, and was impatient that we should get ready, which we soon did. Dr. Johnson, with composure and solemnity, repeated the observation of Epictetus, that, &lsquo;as man has the voyage of death before him, &mdash; whatever may be his employment, he should be ready at the master&rsquo;s call; and an old man should never be far from the shore, lest he should not be able to get himself ready.&rsquo; He rode, and I and the other gentlemen walked, about an English mile to the shore, where the vessel lay. Dr. Johnson said, he should never forget Sky, and returned thanks for all civilities. We were carried to the vessel in a small boat which she had, and we set sail very briskly about one o&rsquo;clock. I was much pleased with the motion for many hours. Dr. Johnson grew sick, and retired under cover, as it rained a good deal. I kept above, that I might have fresh air, and finding myself not affected by the motion of the vessel, I exulted in being a stout seaman, while Dr. Johnson was quite in a state of annihilation. But I was soon humbled; for after imagining that I could go with ease to America or the East-Indies, I became very sick, but kept above board, though it rained hard.</p>
<p class="p24">As we had been detained so long in Sky by bad weather, we gave up the scheme that Col had planned for us of visiting several islands, and contented ourselves with the prospect of seeing Mull, and Icolmkill and Inchkenneth, which lie near to it.</p>
<p class="p24">Mr. Simpson was sanguine in his hopes for awhile, the wind being fair for us. He said, he would land us at Icolmkill that night. But when the wind failed, it was resolved we should make for the sound of Mull, and land in the harbour of Tobermorie. We kept near the five herring vessels for some time; but afterwards four of them got before us, and one little wherry fell behind us. When we got in full view of the point of Ardnamurchan, the wind changed, and was directly against our getting into the Sound. We were then obliged to tack, and get forward in that tedious manner. As we advanced, the storm grew greater, and the sea very rough. Col then began to talk of making for Egg, or Canna, or his own island. Our skipper said, he would get us into the Sound. Having struggled for this a good while in vain, he said, he would push forward till we were near the land of Mull, where we might cast anchor, and lie till the morning; for although, before this, there had been a good moon, and I had pretty distinctly seen not only the land of Mull, but up the Sound, and the country of Morven as at one end of it, the night was now grown very dark. Our crew consisted of one M&rsquo;Donald, our skipper, and two sailors, one of whom had but one eye: Mr. Simpson himself, Col, and Hugh M&rsquo;Donald his servant, all helped. Simpson said, he would willingly go for Col, if young Col or his servant would undertake to pilot us to a harbour; but, as the island is low land, it was dangerous to run upon it in the dark. Col and his servant appeared a little dubious. The scheme of running for Canna seemed then to be embraced; but Canna was ten leagues off, all out of our way; and they were afraid to attempt the harbour of Egg. All these different plans were successively in agitation. The old skipper still tried to make for the land of Mull; but then it was considered that there was no place there where we could anchor in safety. Much time was lost in striving against the storm. At last it became so rough, and threatened to be so much worse, that Col and his servant took more courage, and said they would undertake to hit one of the harbours in Col. &lsquo;Then let us run for it in GOD&rsquo;S name,&rsquo; said the skipper; and instantly we turned towards it. The little wherry which had fallen behind us had hard work. The master begged that, if we made for Col, we should put out a light to him. Accordingly one of the sailors waved a glowing peat for some time. The various difficulties that were started, gave me a good deal of apprehension, from which I was relieved, when I found we were to run for a harbour before the wind. But my relief was but of short duration: for I soon heard that our sails were very bad, and were in danger of being torn in pieces, in which case we should be driven upon the rocky shore of Col. It was very dark, and there was a heavy and incessant rain. The sparks of the burning peat flew so much about, that I dreaded the vessel might take fire. Then, as Col was a sportsman, and had powder on board, I figured that we might be blown up. Simpson and he appeared a little frightened, which made me more so; and the perpetual talking, or rather shouting, which was carried on in Erse, alarmed me still more. A man is always suspicious of what is saying in an unknown tongue; and, if fear be his passion at the time, he grows more afraid. Our vessel often lay so much on one side, that I trembled lest she should be overset, and indeed they told me afterwards, that they had run her sometimes to within an inch of the water, so anxious were they to make what haste they could before the night should be worse. I now saw what I never saw before, a prodigious sea, with immense billows coming upon a vessel, so as that it seemed hardly possible to escape. There was something grandly horrible in the sight. I am glad I have seen it once. Amidst all these terrifying circumstances, I endeavoured to compose my mind. It was not easy to do it; for all the stories that I had heard of the dangerous sailing among the Hebrides, which is proverbial, came full upon my recollection. When I thought of those who were dearest to me, and would suffer severely, should I be lost, I upbraided myself, as not having a sufficient cause for putting myself in such danger. Piety afforded me comfort; yet I was disturbed by the objections that have been made against a particular providence, and by the arguments of those who maintain that it is in vain to hope that the petitions of an individual, or even of congregations, can have any influence with the Deity; objections which have been often made, and which Dr. Hawkesworth has lately revived, in his Preface to the <span class="t8">Voyages to the South Seas</span>; but Dr. Ogden&rsquo;s excellent doctrine on the efficacy of intercession prevailed.</p>
<p class="p24">It was half an hour after eleven before we set ourselves in the course for Col. As I saw them all busy doing something, I asked Col, with much earnestness, what I could do. He, with a happy readiness, put into my hand a rope, which was fixed to the top of one of the masts, and told me to hold it till he bade me pull. If I had considered the matter, I might have seen that this could not be of the least service; but his object was to keep me out of the way of those who were busy working the vessel, and at the same time to divert my fear, by employing me, and making me think that I was of use. Thus did I stand firm to my post, while the wind and rain beat upon me, always expecting a call to pull my rope. The man with one eye steered; old M&rsquo;Donald, and Col and his servant, lay upon the fore-castle, looking sharp out for the harbour. It was necessary to carry much <span class="t8">cloth</span>, as they termed it, that is to say, much sail, in order to keep the vessel off the shore of Col. This made violent plunging in a rough sea. At last they spied the harbour of Lochiern, and Col cried, &lsquo;Thank GOD, we are safe!&rsquo; We ran up till we were opposite to it, and soon afterwards we got into it, and cast anchor.</p>
<p class="p24">Dr. Johnson had all this time been quiet and unconcerned. He had lain down on one of the beds, and having got free from sickness, was satisfied. The truth is, he knew nothing of the danger we were in but, fearless and unconcerned, might have said, in the words which he has chosen for the motto to his <span class="t8">Rambler</span>, </p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Quo me cunque rapit tempestas, deferor hospes.&rsquo;</p>
