<p class="p21">Samuel Johnson died in 1784 in the house of his friend George Strahan, the Vicar of Islington, where the author liked to occasionally visit while suffering from gout, escaping the unhealthy streets of London. Strahan (1744-1824) was known for having been spiritual counsellor to Johnson, who entrusted him with several manuscripts that were later published in their entirety by the vicar as <span class="t8">Prayers and Meditations</span>. These personal journal entries and spiritual writings reveal Johnson&rsquo;s deeply religious nature and the many anxieties he experienced in his later years.</p>
