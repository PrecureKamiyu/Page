The x-axis includes thirteen unlabeled plotted points at regular intervals; the y-axis includes seven unlabeled plotted points at regular intervals. At the first plotted point on the x-axis, a black line extends upwards in a regular stair-step fashion, up to the first plotted point on the y-axis, over, up to the second, etc. The area between the second and third points on the y-axis is labeled "Packets generated."</p><p id="P700101195200000000000000000BB7F" data-uri="M09_KURO4140_07_SE_C09.xhtml#P700101195200000000000000000BB7F">Between after the fifth point on the x-axis is a point labeled "r," which extends upward in an inconsistent stair-step fashion as in figure 9.1. The area between the third and fourth point on the y-axis is labeled "Packets received." Six points have been plotted along the stair-step pattern for r; the fourth appears outside of the pattern and is labeled "Missed playout." These plotted points are connected with a line that is labeled "Playout schedule p-r."</p><p id="P700101195200000000000000000BB80" data-uri="M09_KURO4140_07_SE_C09.xhtml#P700101195200000000000000000BB80">Between the fifth and sixth points on the x-axis is a point labeled "p." And between the seventh and eight points is a point labeled "p1." Above p1 is a series of plotted points that run parallel to r's and which are connected by a line that is labeled "Playout schedule p1-r."</p></div></section></body></html>
