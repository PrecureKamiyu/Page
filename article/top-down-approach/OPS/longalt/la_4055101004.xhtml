In the Mobile Network, the router connects to the cell phone tower, and the signal from the cell phone tower connects to everything in that network. In the Home Network, the path begins with a router in the Local or Regional ISP and travels through telephone wires to a router in the Home Network, where it is delivered to all the devices in that network. In the Enterprise Network, the path begins with a router that leads to a link-layer switch and extends to a series of desktop computers, as well as a wireless router that sends its signal to a series of laptop computers and a tablet device, and extends to a second link-layer switch that connects to a series of servers.</p></div></section></body></html>
