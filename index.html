       <h1>Japanese</h1>
       <h2>Learning Japanese</h2>
       <p>
       Are you interested about the Japanese? If you are, there is something interesting about learning Japanese, that is
       学校语法和教育语法. 
       </p>
       <p>教育语法是面对非母语学习者的, 在标日中, 在单词表中, 动词为ます形, 但其在学校语法中称为连体形 + ます助动词, 类比于英语里面, can should 等助动词后面需加上原型, 而 need 可以加不定式. 同理, ない形也是如此. 更比如, 我们能见到复合动词, 其为两个动词的链接, 形式为连体形 + 动词</p>
       <p>我们能看见这里的分歧, 现在的问题是如何选择. 得到的建议是, 先学教育语法, 学到中等水平之后再深入接触学校语法. 
       各个人的意见各不相同, 并且有人指出, 教学领域里其实也是混乱不堪, 没人搞得懂哪个更为合适. 更多的我就不说了, 因为我也搞不懂. </p>
       <h2>Japanese in TeX</h2>
       <p>
       pTeX is invented for typesetting Japanese. And UpTeX is the extended version of pTeX. Both of them may have been viewed 
       as Legacy for typesetting Japanese for LuaTeX is doing a pretty good job. 
       </p>
       <p>
       Before you try to formatting some Japanese yourself, you may want to check out for this article about <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/jlreq/?lang=en">jlreq</a> (and <a href="https://github.com/abenori/jlreq" target="_blank">this one</a> for further information). Basically, it tells about the standard when formatting Japanese. You may skip it since it is too long. Anyway, you need to know that there is such thing as jlreq. 
       </p>
       <p>You may begin with a simple <code>.tex</code> file</p>
       <pre><code><!--
-->         \documentclass{jlreq}
	\begin{document}
	こんにちは。
	\end{document}</code></pre>
       <p>And compile the <code>.tex</code> file with <code>uplatex</code>. And you will get a <code>.dvi</code> file, whose name stands for <q>device indenpendent</q>, which is one of the feature of <code>.pdf</code> file, since it is designed that the same thing is displayed even on different devices and you may guess that <code>.dvi</code> plays the similar role before <code>.pdf</code> is born. Stupid Japanese use it because they can, for their devices haven't been renewed for decades. Your device already have been installed with <code>.dvi</code> reader if you have installed TeX Live. 
       A tool <code>dvipdfmx</code> is also installed which is used to, as its name has shown, to convert <code>.dvi</code> file into a <code>.pdf</code> file. You may run <code>dvipdfmx foo.dvi</code> to get a <code>.pdf</code> file.</p>
       <p>However, things get interesting when you try to open the output file, viz., the <code>.dvi</code> file: you just can't open it, or you may be able to open it since there could be something wrong with my device. Anyway, what is happening is that <code>.dvi</code> file does not have the information of font. When <code>uplatex</code> compile the <code>.tex</code> file, it use 
       <code>.dvi</code> file to store information including the position of the characters, but not the specific font that would be displayed. Later, <code>dvipdfmx</code> map the font. And further more, you can actually change the font not by changing the <code>.tex</code> file, but by applying an additional map together with <code>dvipdfmx</code>. </p>
       <p>Consequently, you can formatting Hanzi using upLaTeX. And there is vertical typesetting mode in upLaTeX. For <code>jlreq</code> class, just add parameter <code>tate</code> to the document class, viz., <code>\documentclass[tate]{jlreq}</code>. Thus you can formatting Hanzi vertically (after reading <a href="https://ldbeth.github.io/2017/03/29/uplatex/" target="_blank">this article</a>). </p>
       <p>Awesome.</p>
       <p>But, it is possible that the font you need is not installed on your device. In my case, <code>.ttf</code> font is needed. If you have the similar problem, please check <a href="https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/618457933" target="_blank">an article in Zhihu.</a> about how to install a true type font and make TeX Live regonize it.</p>

		   <h1>TeX</h1>
		   <p>What you should do if you want to learn TeX:</p>
		   <ol>
		   	<li>Download TeX Live on your linux machine</li>
			<li>Run <code>texdoc lshort-zh-cn</code> in your terminal</li>
			<li>Read it</li>
			<li>Write your homework with LaTeX</li>
			<li>Read the <a href="https://visualmatheditor.equatheque.net/doc/texbook.pdf" target="_blank">TeXbook</a> and 
			learn some cool things about TeX</li>
		   </ol>
		   <h2>TeXbook</h2>
		   <p>TeXbook is not just about TeX. It also tells you about <strong>what is typesetting</strong>. I didn't know a thing about
		   the spacing between some certain letters like V and A before I knew about what kerning is in TeX. It helps you 
		   build a taste that tells you which is good typesetting and which is not. Clearly enough, html is not good enough for formatting text.</p>
		   <p>Maybe it is enough for one who is interested in TeX, but there is also some great source like <a href="https://texdoc.org/serve/texbytopic/0" target="_blank">TeX by Topic</a>.</p>
		   <h2>LaTeX</h2>
		   <p>Honest speaking, I need more references to LaTeX. Since I have no idea about the macro, for now.</p>
