<h2 class="h20"><a id="a1983"></a>PROLOGUE.</h2>
<p class="p26">Ye glitt&rsquo;ring train, whom lace and velvet bless,<br/>Suspend the soft solicitudes of dress!<br/>From grov&rsquo;ling bus&rsquo;ness and superfluous care,<br/>Ye sons of avarice, a moment spare!<br/>Vot&rsquo;ries of fame, and worshippers of power,<br/>Dismiss the pleasing phantoms for an hour!<br/>Our daring bard, with spirit unconfin&rsquo;d,<br/>Spreads wide the mighty moral for mankind.<br/>Learn here, how heaven supports the virtuous mind,<br/>Daring, though calm; and vig&rsquo;rous, though resign&rsquo;d;<br/>Learn here, what anguish racks the guilty breast,<br/>In pow&rsquo;r dependant, in success depress&rsquo;d.<br/>Learn here, that peace from innocence must flow;<br/>All else is empty sound, and idle show.</p>
<p class="p26">If truths, like these, with pleasing language join;<br/>Ennobled, yet unchang&rsquo;d, if nature shine;<br/>If no wild draught depart from reason&rsquo;s rules;<br/>Nor gods his heroes, nor his lovers fools;<br/>Intriguing wits! his artless plot forgive;<br/>And spare him, beauties! though his lovers live.</p>
<p class="p26">Be this, at least, his praise, be this his pride;<br/>To force applause, no modern arts are try&rsquo;d.<br/>Should partial catcals all his hopes confound,<br/>He bids no trumpet quell the fatal sound.<br/>Should welcome sleep relieve the weary wit,<br/>He rolls no thunders o&rsquo;er the drowsy pit;<br/>No snares, to captivate the judgment, spreads,<br/>Nor bribes your eyes to prejudice your heads.<br/>Unmov&rsquo;d, though witlings sneer, and rivals rail,<br/>Studious to please, yet not asham&rsquo;d to fail,<br/>He scorns the meek address, the suppliant strain,<br/>With merit needless, and without it vain.<br/>In reason, nature, truth, he dares to trust:<br/>Ye fops, be silent: and, ye wits, be just!</p>
