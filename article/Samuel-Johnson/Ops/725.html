<p class="p21">Johnson published this critical work on Shakespeare&rsquo;s tragedy on 6 April 1745.&nbsp; The <span class="t8">Miscellaneous Observations on the Tragedy of Macbeth</span> contains many of Johnson&rsquo;s early thoughts and theories on Shakespearean criticism. For instance, Johnson explains his belief that there is &lsquo;uncanny power&rsquo; in Shakespeare&rsquo;s supernatural scenes.&nbsp; He explains this as, &ldquo;He that peruses Shakespeare looks round alarmed and starts to find himself alone&rdquo;. At the end of the work, Johnson announced that he would produce a new edition of Shakespeare: &ldquo;Proposals for printing a new edition of the plays of William Shakespeare, with notes, critical and explanatory, in which the text will be corrected: the various readings remarked: the conjectures of former editors examined, and their omissions supplied. By the author of the Miscellaneous Observations on the Tragedy of Macbeth.&rdquo; In this now famous edition Johnson would seek to determine the original language of the Shakespearean plays. To benefit the reading audience, he added explanatory notes to various passages. Later editors would all follow Johnson&rsquo;s lead, seeking to determine a scholarly and authoritative text of Shakespeare.</p>
