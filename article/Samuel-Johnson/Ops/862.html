<p class="p26">This night presents a play, which publick rage,<br/>Or right, or wrong, once hooted from the stage.<br/>From zeal or malice, now, no more we dread,<br/>For English vengeance wars not with the dead.<br/>A gen&rsquo;rous foe regards, with pitying eye,<br/>The man whom fate has laid, where all must lie.<br/>To wit, reviving from its author&rsquo;s dust,<br/>Be kind, ye judges, or at least be just.<br/>For no renew&rsquo;d hostilities invade<br/>Th&rsquo; oblivious grave&rsquo;s inviolable shade.<br/>Let one great payment ev&rsquo;ry claim appease;<br/>And him, who cannot hurt, allow to please;<br/>To please by scenes, unconscious of offence,<br/>By harmless merriment, or useful sense.<br/>Where aught of bright, or fair, the piece displays,<br/>Approve it only&mdash; &rsquo;tis too late to praise.<br/>If want of skill, or want of care appear,<br/>Forbear to hiss &mdash; the poet cannot hear.<br/>By all, like him, must praise and blame be found,<br/>At best a fleeting gleam, or empty sound.<br/>Yet, then, shall calm reflection bless the night,<br/>When lib&rsquo;ral pity dignify&rsquo;d delight;<br/>When pleasure fir&rsquo;d her torch at virtue&rsquo;s flame,<br/>And mirth was bounty with an humbler name.</p>
