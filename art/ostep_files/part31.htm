Today’s operating systems make systems relatively easy to use, and virtually all operating systems you use today have been influenced by the developments we will discuss throughout the book.</p><p style="padding-left: 68pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Unfortunately, due to time constraints, there are a number of parts of the OS we won’t cover in the book. For example, there is a lot of <b>net- working </b>code in the operating system; we leave it to you to take the net- working class to learn more about that. Similarly, <b>graphics </b>devices are particularly important; take the graphics course to expand your knowl- edge in that direction. Finally, some operating system books talk a great deal about <b>security</b>; we will do so in the sense that the OS must provide protection between running programs and give users the ability to pro- tect their files, but we won’t delve into deeper security issues that one might find in a security course.</p><p style="padding-left: 68pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">However, there are many important topics that we will cover, includ- ing the basics of virtualization of the CPU and memory, concurrency, and persistence via devices and file systems. Don’t worry! While there is a lot of ground to cover, most of it is quite cool, and at the end of the road, you’ll have a new appreciation for how computer systems really work. Now get to work!</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part30.htm">&lt; 上一个</a><span> | </span><a href="../ostep.html">内容</a><span> | </span><a href="part32.htm">下一个 &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
