<h2 class="h20"><a id="a1825"></a><a id="a1824"></a>HAMLET</h2>
<p class="p24">(145,2) This play is printed both in the folio of 1623, and in the quarto of 1637, more correctly, than almost any other of the works of Shakespeare.</p>
<p class="p24">I.i.29 (147,7) approve our eyes] Add a new testimony to that of our eyes.</p>
<p class="p24">I.i.33 (147,8) What we two nights have seen] This line is by Hanmer given to Marcellus, but without necessity.</p>
<p class="p24">I.i.63 (149,9) He smote the sledded Polack on the ice] Polack was, in that age, the term for an inhabitant of Poland: Polaque, French. As in a translation of Passeratius&rsquo;s epitaph on Henry III. of France, published by Camden:</p>
<p class="p24">&ldquo;Whether thy chance or choice thee hither brings,</p>
<p class="p24">&ldquo;Stay, passenger, and wail the best of kings.</p>
<p class="p24">&ldquo;this little stone a great king&rsquo;s heart doth hold,</p>
<p class="p24">&ldquo;Who rul&rsquo;d the fickle French and Polacks bold:</p>
<p class="p24">&ldquo;So frail are even the highest earthly things,</p>
<p class="p24">&ldquo;Go, passenger, and wail the hap of kings.&rdquo; (rev. 1776, I, 174,3)</p>
<p class="p24">I.i.65 (149,2) and just at this dead hour] The old reading is, <span class="t8">jump at this same hour; same</span> is a kind of correlative to <span class="t8">jump; just</span> is in the oldest folio. The correction was probably made by the author.</p>
<p class="p24">I.i.68 (149,4) gross and scope] General thoughts, and tendency at large. (1773)</p>
<p class="p24">I.i.93 (151,7) And carriage of the articles design&rsquo;d] <span class="t8">Carriage</span>, is <span class="t8">import; design&rsquo;d</span>, is <span class="t8">formed, drawn up between them</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">I.i.96 (151,8) Of unimproved mettle hot and full] <span class="t8">Full of unimproved mettle</span>, is full of spirit not regulated or guided by knowledge or experience.</p>
<p class="p24">I.i.100 (151,1) That hath a stomach in&rsquo;t] <span class="t8">Stomach</span>, in the time of our author, was used for <span class="t8">constancy, resolution</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">I.i.107 (152,3) romage] Tumultous hurry. (1773)</p>
<p class="p24">I.i.108-125 (152,3) These, and all other lines confin&rsquo;d within crotchets throughout this play, are omitted in the folio edition of 1623. The omissions leave the play sometimes better and sometimes worse, and seen made only for the sake of abbreviation.</p>
<p class="p24">I.i.109 (152,4) Well may it sort] The cause and the effect are proportionate and suitable. (1773)</p>
<p class="p24">I.i.121 (152,7) Was even the like precurse of fierce events] Not only such prodigies have been seen in Rome, but the elements have shewn our countrymen like forerunners and foretokens of violent events. (1773)</p>
<p class="p24">I.i.128 (153,1) If thou hast any sound] The speech of Horatio to the spectre is very elegant and noble, and congruous to the common traditions of the causes of apparitions.</p>
<p class="p24">I.i.153 (154,2)</p>
<p class="p24">Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,</p>
<p class="p24">The extravagant and erring spirit hies</p>
<p class="p24">To his confine]</p>
<p class="p24">According to the pneumatology of that tine, every element was inhabited by its peculiar order of spirits, who had dispositions different, according to their various places of abode. The meaning therefore is, that all <span class="t8">spirits extravagant</span>, wandering out of their element, whether aerial spirits visiting earth, or earthly spirits ranging the air, return to their station, to their proper limits in which they are <span class="t8">confined</span>. We might read,</p>
<p class="p24">&ldquo; &mdash; And at his warning</p>
<p class="p24">&ldquo;Th&rsquo; extravagant and erring spirit hies</p>
<p class="p24">&ldquo;To his confine, whether in sea or air,</p>
<p class="p24">&ldquo;Or earth, or fire. And of, &amp;c.</p>
<p class="p24">But this change, tho&rsquo; it would smooth the construction, is not necessary, and being unnecessary, should not be made against authority.</p>
<p class="p24">I.i.163 (154,5) No fairy takes] No fairy <span class="t8">strikes</span>, with lameness or diseases. This sense of <span class="t8">take</span> is frequent in this author.</p>
<p class="p24">I.ii.37 (156,8) more than the scope/Of these dilated articles allows] More than is comprised in the general design of these articles, which you may explain in a more diffuse and dilated stile. (1773)</p>
<p class="p24">I.ii.47 (157,9)</p>
<p class="p24">The head is not more native to the heart,</p>
<p class="p24">The hand more instrumental to the mouth,</p>
<p class="p24">Than to the throne of Denmark is thy father]</p>
<p class="p24">[W: The blood ... Than to the throne] Part of this emendation I have received, but cannot discern why the <span class="t8">head</span> is not as much <span class="t8">native to the heart</span>, as the <span class="t8">blood</span>, that is, <span class="t8">natural</span> and <span class="t8">congenial</span> to it, <span class="t8">born with it</span>, and co-operating with it. The relation is likewise by this reading better preserved, the <span class="t8">counsellor</span> being to the <span class="t8">king</span> as the <span class="t8">head</span> to the <span class="t8">heart</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">I.ii.62 (158,1)</p>
<p class="p24">Take thy fair hour, Laertes; time be thine,</p>
<p class="p24">And thy best graces spend it at thy will]</p>
<p class="p24">I rather think this line is in want of emendation. I read,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&mdash; <span class="t8">Time is thine</span>,</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">And</span> my best <span class="t8">graces; spend it at thy will</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">I.ii.65 (158,2) A little more than kin, and less than kind] <span class="t8">Kind</span> is the Teutonick word for <span class="t8">child</span>. Hamlet therefore answers with propriety, to the titles of <span class="t8">cousin</span> and <span class="t8">son</span>, which the king had given him, that he was somewhat more than <span class="t8">cousin</span>, and less than <span class="t8">son</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">I.ii.67 (159,3) too much i&rsquo; the sun] He perhaps alludes to the proverb, <span class="t8">Out of heaven&rsquo;s blessing into the warm sun</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">I.ii.70 (159,4) veiled lids] With lowering eyes, cast down eyes. (1773)</p>
<p class="p24">I.ii.89 (160,5) your father lost a father;/That father lost, lost his] I do not admire the repetition of the word, but it has so much of our author&rsquo;s manner, that I find no temptation to recede from the old copies.</p>
<p class="p24">I.ii.92 (160,6) obsequious sorrow] <span class="t8">Obsequious</span> is here from <span class="t8">obsequies</span>, or <span class="t8">funeral ceremonies</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">I.ii.103 (161,9) To reason most absurd] Reason is here used in its common sense, for the <span class="t8">faculty</span> by which we form conclusions from arguments.</p>
<p class="p24">I.ii.110 (161,1) And with no less nobility of love] [<span class="t8">Nobility</span>, for <span class="t8">magnitude</span>. WARBURTON.] <span class="t8">Nobility</span> is rather <span class="t8">generosity</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">I.ii.112 (161,2) Do I impart toward you] I believe <span class="t8">impart</span> is, <span class="t8">impart myself</span>, <span class="t8">communicate</span> whatever I can bestow.</p>
<p class="p24">I.ii.125 (162,4) No jocund health] The king&rsquo;s intemperance is very strongly impressed; every thing that happens to him gives him occasion to drink.</p>
<p class="p24">I.ii.163 (164,9) I&rsquo;ll change that name] I&rsquo;ll be your servant, you shall be my friend. (1773)</p>
<p class="p24">I.ii.164 (164,1) what make you] A familiar phrase for <span class="t8">what are you doing</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">I.ii.167 (164,2) good Even, Sir] So the copies. Sir Th. Hanmer and Dr. Warburton put it, <span class="t8">good morning</span>. The alteration is of no importance, but all licence is dangerous. There is no need of any change. Between the first and eighth scene of this act it is apparent, that a natural day must pass, and how much of it is already over, there is nothing that can determine. The king has held a council. It may now as well be <span class="t8">evening</span> as <span class="t8">morning</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">I.ii.182 (165,3) &lsquo;Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven] <span class="t8">Dearest</span>, for <span class="t8">direst</span>, most dreadful, most dangerous.</p>
<p class="p24">I.ii.192 (165,5) Season your admiration] That is, <span class="t8">temper</span> it.</p>
<p class="p24">I.ii.204 (166,6) they, distill&rsquo;d/Almost to jelly with the act of fear,/Stand dumb] [W: th&rsquo; effect of] Here is an affectation of subtilty without accuracy. <span class="t8">Fear</span> is every day considered as an <span class="t8">agent</span>. <span class="t8">Fear laid hold on him; fear drove him away</span>. If it were proper to be rigorous in examining trifles, it might be replied, that Shakespeare would write more erroneously, if he wrote by the direction of this critick; they were not <span class="t8">distilled</span>, whatever the word may mean, <span class="t8">by the effect of fear</span>; for that <span class="t8">distillation</span> was itself the <span class="t8">effect</span>; <span class="t8">fear</span> was the cause, the active cause, that <span class="t8">distilled</span> them by that force of operation which we strictly call <span class="t8">act</span> involuntary, and <span class="t8">power</span> in involuntary agents, but popularly call <span class="t8">act</span> in both. But of this too much.</p>
<p class="p24">I.iii.15 (169,9) The virtue of his will] <span class="t8">Virtue</span> seems here to comprise both <span class="t8">excellence</span> and <span class="t8">power</span>, and may be explained the <span class="t8">pure effect</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">I.iii.21 (169,1) The sanity and health of the whole state] [W: safety] HANMER reads very rightly, <span class="t8">sanity</span>. <span class="t8">Sanctity</span> is elsewhere printed for <span class="t8">sanity</span>, in the old edition of this play.</p>
<p class="p24">I.iii.32 (170,2) unmaster&rsquo;d] i.e. <span class="t8">licentious</span>. (1773)</p>
<p class="p24">I.iii.34 (170,3) keep you in the rear of your affection] That is, do not advance so far as your affection would lead you.</p>
<p class="p24">I.iii.49 (170,4) Whilst, like a puft and reckless libertine] [W: Whilest he] The emendation is not amiss, but the reason for it is very inconclusive; we use the same mode of speaking on many occasions. When I say of one, <span class="t8">he squanders like a spendthrift</span>, of another, <span class="t8">he robbed me like a thief</span>, the phrase produces no ambiguity; it is understood that the one is a <span class="t8">spendthrift</span>, and the other a <span class="t8">thief</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">I.iii.64 (172,7) But do not dull thy palm with entertainment/Of each new-hatch&rsquo;d, unfledg&rsquo;d comrade] The literal sense is, <span class="t8">Do not make thy palm callous by shaking every man by the hand</span>. The figurative meaning may be, <span class="t8">Do not by promiscuous conversation make thy mind insensible to the difference of characters</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">I.iii.81 (173,1) my blessing season this in thee!] [<span class="t8">Season</span>, for <span class="t8">infuse</span>. WARBURTON.] It is more than to <span class="t8">infuse</span>, it is to infix it in such a manner as that it never may wear out.</p>
<p class="p24">I.iii.83 (173,3) your servants tend] i.e. your servants are waiting for you. (1773)</p>
<p class="p24">I.iii.86 (173,4) &rsquo;Tis in my memory lock&rsquo;d,/And you yourself shall keep the key of it] That is, By thinking on you, I shall think on your lessons.</p>
<p class="p24">I.iii.107 (174,6)</p>
<p class="p24">Tender yourself mere dearly;</p>
<p class="p24">Or (not to crack the wind of the poor phrase)</p>
<p class="p24">Wronging it thus, you&rsquo;ll tender me a fool]</p>
<p class="p24">I believe the word <span class="t8">wronging</span> has reference, not to the phrase, but to Ophelia; if you go on <span class="t8">wronging it thus</span>, that is, <span class="t8">if you continue to go on thus wrong</span>. This is a mode of speaking perhaps not very grammatical, but very common, nor have the best writers refused it.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">To sinner it or saint it</span>,</p>
<p class="p24">is in Pope. And Rowe,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&mdash; <span class="t8">Thus to</span> coy it,</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">To one who knows you too.</span></p>
<p class="p24">The folio has it,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&mdash; <span class="t8">roaming it thus</span>, &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">That is, <span class="t8">letting yourself loose to such improper liberty</span>. But <span class="t8">wronging</span> seems to be more proper.</p>
<p class="p24">I.iii.112 (175,7) fashion you may call it] She uses <span class="t8">fashion</span> for <span class="t8">manner</span>, and he for a <span class="t8">transient practice</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">I.iii.122 (175,8) Set your intreatments] <span class="t8">Intreatments</span> here means <span class="t8">company, conversation</span>, from the French <span class="t8">entrétien</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">I.iii.125 (175,9) larger tether] <span class="t8">Tether</span> is that string by which an animal, set to graze in grounds uninclosed, is confined within the proper limits. (1773)</p>
<p class="p24">I.iii.132 (176,2) I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth,/ Have you so slander any moment&rsquo;s leisure] [The humour of this is fine. WARBURTON.] Here is another <span class="t8">fine</span> passage, of which I take the beauty to be only imaginary. Polonius says, <span class="t8">in plain terms</span>, that is, not in language less elevated or embellished than before, but <span class="t8">in terms that cannot be misunderstood</span>: <span class="t8">I would not have you so disgrace your most idle moments, as not to find better employment for them than lord Hamlet&rsquo;s conversation</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">I.iv.9 (177,3) the swaggering up-spring] The blustering upstart.</p>
<p class="p24">I.iv.17 (177,4) This heavy-headed revel, east and west] I should not have suspected this passage of ambiguity or obscurity, had I not found my opinion of it differing from that of the learned critic [Warburton]. I construe it thus, <span class="t8">This heavy-headed revel makes us traduced east and west, and taxed of other nations</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">I.iv.22 (178,5) The pith and marrow of our attribute] The best and most valuable part of the praise that would be otherwise attributed to us.</p>
<p class="p24">I.iv.32 (178,7) fortune&rsquo;s scar] In the old quarto of 1637, it is</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&mdash; <span class="t8">fortune&rsquo;s</span> star:</p>
<p class="p24">But I think <span class="t8">scar</span> is proper.</p>
<p class="p24">I.iv.34 (178,8) As infinite as man may undergo] As large as can be accumulated upon man.</p>
<p class="p24">I.iv.39-57 (179,2) Angels and ministers of grace defend us!] Hamlet&rsquo;s speech to the apparition of his father seems to me to consist of three parts. When first he sees the spectre, he fortifies himself with an invocation.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Angel and ministers of grace defend us!</span></p>
<p class="p24">As the spectre approaches, he deliberates with himself, and determines, that whatever it be he will venture to address it.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Be thou a spirit of health, or goblin damn&rsquo;d,</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Bring with thee airs from heaven, or blasts from hell,</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Be thy intents wicked or charitable,</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Thou com&rsquo;st in such a questionable shape,</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">That I will speak to thee. I&rsquo;ll call thee</span>, &amp;c.</p>
<p class="p24">This he says while his father is advancing; he then, as he had determined, <span class="t8">speaks to him</span>, and <span class="t8">calls him &mdash; Hamlet, King, Father, Royal Dane: oh! answer me</span>. (1773)</p>
<p class="p24">I.iv.43 (180,4) questionable shape] [By <span class="t8">questionable</span> is meant provoking question. HANMER.] So in <span class="t8">Macbeth</span>,</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Live you, or are you aught</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">That man may</span> question?</p>
<p class="p24">I.iv.46 (180,5) tell,/Why thy canoniz&rsquo;d bones, hearsed in death,/ Have burst their cearments?] [W: in earth] It were too long to examine this note period by period, though almost every period seems to me to contain something reprehensible. The critic, in his zeal for change, writes with so little consideration, as to say, that Hamlet cannot call his father <span class="t8">canonized</span>, because <span class="t8">we are told he was murdered with all his sins fresh upon him</span>. He was not then told it, and had so little the power of knowing it, that he was to be told it by an apparition. The long succession of reasons upon reasons prove nothing, but what every reader discovers, that the king had been buried, which is implied by so many adjuncts of burial, that the direct mention of <span class="t8">earth</span> is not necessary. Hamlet, amazed at an apparition, which, though in all ages credited, has in all ages been considered as the most wonderful and most dreadful operation of supernatural agency, enquires of the spectre, in the most emphatic terms, why he breaks the order of nature, by returning from the dead; this he asks in a very confused circumlocution, confounding in his fright the soul and body. Why, says he, have <span class="t8">thy bones</span>, which with due ceremonies have been intombed <span class="t8">in death</span>, in the common state of departed mortals, <span class="t8">burst</span> the folds in which they were embalmed? Why has the tomb, in which we saw thee quietly laid, opened his mouth, that mouth which, by its weight and stability, seemed closed for ever? The whole sentence is this: <span class="t8">Why dost thou appear, whom we know to be dead?</span></p>
<p class="p24">Had the change of the word removed any obscurity, or added any beauty, it might have been worth a struggle; but either reading leaves the sense the same.</p>
<p class="p24">If there be any asperity in this controversial note, it must be imputed to the contagion of peevishneas, or some resentment of the incivility shewn to the Oxford editor, who is represented as supposing the ground <span class="t8">canonized</span> by a funeral, when he only meant to say, that the <span class="t8">body</span> has deposited in <span class="t8">holy ground</span>, in ground consecrated according to the <span class="t8">canon</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">I.iv.65 (183,9) I do not set my life at a pin&rsquo;s fee] The value of a pin. (1773)</p>
<p class="p24">I.iv.73 (183,1) deprive your sovereignty] I believe <span class="t8">deprive</span> in this place signifies simply to <span class="t8">take away</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">I.iv.77 (184,4) confin&rsquo;d to fast in fires] I am rather inclined to read, <span class="t8">confin&rsquo;d to</span> lasting <span class="t8">fires</span>, to fires <span class="t8">unremitted</span> and <span class="t8">unconsumed</span>. The change is slight.</p>
<p class="p24">I.v.30 (186,7) As meditation or the thoughts of love] The comment [Warburton&rsquo;s] on the word <span class="t8">meditation</span> is so ingenious, that I hope it is just.</p>
<p class="p24">I.v.77 (188,6) Unhonsel&rsquo;d, disappointed, unaneal&rsquo;d] This is a very difficult line. I think Theobald&rsquo;s objection to the sense of <span class="t8">unaneal&rsquo;d</span>, for <span class="t8">notified by the bell</span>, must be owned to be very strong. I have not yet by my enquiry satisfied myself. Hanmer&rsquo;s explication of <span class="t8">unaneal&rsquo;d</span> by <span class="t8">unprepar&rsquo;d</span>, because to <span class="t8">anneal</span> metals, is to <span class="t8">prepare</span> them in manufacture, is too general and vague; there is no resemblance between any funeral ceremony and the practice of <span class="t8">annealing</span> metals.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Disappointed</span> is the same as <span class="t8">unappointed</span>, and may be properly explained <span class="t8">unprepared</span>; a man well furnished with things necessary for any enterprize, was said to be well <span class="t8">appointed</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">I.v.80 (190,7) Oh, horrible! oh, horrible! most horrible!] It was ingeniously hinted to me by a very learned lady, that this line seems to belong to Hamlet, in whose mouth it is a proper and natural exclamation; and who, according to the practice of the stage, may be supposed to interrupt so long a speech. (1773)</p>
<p class="p24">I.v.154 (193,5) Swear by my sword] [Here the poet has preserved the manners of the ancient Danes, with whom it was <span class="t8">religion</span> to swear upon their swords. WARBURTON.] I was once inclinable to this opinion, which is likewise well defended by Mr. Upton; but Mr. Garrick produced me a passage, I think, in <span class="t8">Brantoms</span>, from which it appeared, that it was common to swear upon the sword, that is, upon the cross which the old swords always had upon the hilt.</p>
<p class="p24">II.i.25 (197,8) drinking, fencing, swearing] I suppose, by <span class="t8">fencing</span> is meant a too diligent frequentation of the fencing-school, a resort of violent and lawless young men.</p>
<p class="p24">II.i.46 (197,4) <span class="t8">Good Sir</span>, or so, or <span class="t8">friend</span>, or <span class="t8">gentleman</span>] [W: sire] I know not that <span class="t8">sire</span> was ever a general word of compliment, as distinct from <span class="t8">sir</span>; nor do I conceive why any alteration should be made. It is a common mode of colloquial language to use, <span class="t8">or so</span>, as a slight intimation of more of the same, or a like kind, that might be mentioned. We might read, but we need not,</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Good sir</span>, forsooth, <span class="t8">or friend, or gentleman</span>.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Forsooth</span>, a term of which I do not well know the original meaning, was used to men as well as to women.</p>
<p class="p24">II.i.71 (198,5) Observe his inclination in yourself] HANMER reads, <span class="t8">e&rsquo;en</span> yourself, and is followed by Dr. Warburton; but perhaps <span class="t8">in</span> yourself means, <span class="t8">in your own person</span>, not by spies.</p>
<p class="p24">II.i.112 (200,7) I had not quoted him] To <span class="t8">quote</span> is, I believe, to <span class="t8">reckon</span>, to take an account of, to take the <span class="t8">quotient</span> or result of a computation.</p>
<p class="p24">II.i.114 (201,8)</p>
<p class="p24">it as proper to our age</p>
<p class="p24">To cast beyond ourselves in our opinions,</p>
<p class="p24">As it is common for the younger sort</p>
<p class="p24">To lack discretion]</p>
<p class="p24">This is not the remark of a weak man. The vice of age is too much suspicion. Men long accustomed to the wiles of life <span class="t8">cast</span> commonly <span class="t8">beyond themselves</span>, let their cunning go further than reason can attend it. This is always the fault of a little mind, made artful by long commerce with the world.</p>
<p class="p24">II.ii.24 (202,2)</p>
<p class="p24">For the supply and profit of our hope,</p>
<p class="p24">Your visitation shall receive such thanks]</p>
<p class="p24">That the hope which your arrival has raised may be completed by the desired effect.</p>
<p class="p24">II.ii.47 (203,4) the trail of policy] The <span class="t8">trail</span> is the <span class="t8">course of an animal pursued by the scent</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">Il.ii.52 (203,5) My news shall be the fruit of that great feast] The <span class="t8">desert</span> after the meat.</p>
<p class="p24">II.ii.84 (204,7) at night we&rsquo;ll feast] The king&rsquo;s intemperance is never suffered to be forgotten.</p>
<p class="p24">II.ii.86-167 (205,8) My liege, and Madam, to expostulate] This account of the character of Polonius, though it sufficiently reconciles the seeming inconsistency of so much wisdom with so much folly, does not perhaps correspond exactly to the ideas of our author. The commentator Warburton makes the character of Polonius, a character only of manners, discriminated by properties superficial, accidental, and acquired. The poet intended a nobler delineation of a mixed character of manners and of nature. Polonius is a man bred in courts, exercised in business, stored with observations, confident of his knowledge, proud of his eloquence, and declining into dotage. His mode of oratory is truly represented as designed to ridicule the practice of those times, of prefaces that made no introduction, and of method that embarrassed rather than explained. This part of his character is accidental, the rest is natural. Such a man is positive and confident, because he knows that his mind was once strong, and knows not that it is become weak. Such a man excels in general principles, but fails in the particular application. He is knowing in retrospect, and ignorant in foresight. While he depends upon his memory, and can draw from his repositories of knowledge, he utters weighty sentences, and gives useful counsel; but as the mind in its enfeebled state cannot be kept long busy and intent, the old man is subject to sudden dereliction of his faculties, he loses the order of his ideas, and entangles himself in his own thoughts, till he recovers the leading principle, and falls again into his former train. This idea of dotage encroaching upon wisdom, will solve all the phaenomena of the character of Polonius.</p>
<p class="p24">II.ii.109 (207,1) <span class="t8">To the celestial, and my soul&rsquo;s idol, the most beautified Ophelia</span>] [T: beatified] Both Sir Thomas Hanmer and Dr. Warburton have followed Theobald, but I am in doubt whether <span class="t8">beautified</span>, though, as Polonius calls it, a <span class="t8">vile phrase</span>, be not the proper word. <span class="t8">Beautified</span> seems to be a <span class="t8">vile phrase</span>, for the ambiguity of its meaning, (rev. 1778, X, 241, 3)</p>
<p class="p24">II.ii.126 (208,2) more above] is, <span class="t8">moreover, besides</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">II.ii.145 (209,6) she took the fruits of my advice] She took the <span class="t8">fruits</span> of advice when she obeyed advice, the advice was then made <span class="t8">fruitful</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">II.ii.181 (211,9) For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog,/Being a god, kissing carrion] [This is Warburton&rsquo;s emendation for &ldquo;a good kissing&rdquo;] This is a noble emendation, which almost sets the critic on a level with the author.</p>
<p class="p24">II.ii.265 (214,2) the shadow of a dream] Shakespeare has accidentally inverted an expression of Pindar, that the state of humanity is the <span class="t8">dream</span> of a <span class="t8">shadow</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">II.ii.269 (215,3) Then are our beggars, bodies] Shakespeare seems here to design a ridicule of these declamations against wealth and greatness, that seem to make happiness consist in poverty.</p>
<p class="p24">II.ii.336 (217,7) shall end his part in peace] [After these words the folio adds, <span class="t8">the clown shall make those laugh whose lungs are tickled o&rsquo; th&rsquo; sere</span>. WARBURTON.] This passage I have omitted, for the same reason, I suppose, as the other editors: I do not understand it.</p>
<p class="p24">II.ii.338 (217,8) the lady shall say her mind freely, or the blank verse shall halt for&rsquo;t] <span class="t8">The lady shall have no obstruction, unless from the lameness of the verse.</span></p>
<p class="p24">II.ii.346 (217,9) I think, their inhibition comes by the means of the late innovation] I fancy this is transposed: Hamlet enquires not about an <span class="t8">inhibition</span>, but an <span class="t8">innovation</span>; the answer therefore probably was, <span class="t8">I think, their</span> innovation, <span class="t8">that is</span>, their new practice of strolling, <span class="t8">comes by the means of the late</span> inhibition.</p>
<p class="p24">II.ii.352-379 (218,1) <span class="t8">Ham.</span> How comes it? do they grow rusty?] The lines marked with commas are in the folio of 1623, but not in the quarto of 1637, nor, I suppose, in any of the quartos.</p>
<p class="p24">II.ii.355 (218,2) cry out on the top of question] The meaning seems to be, they ask a common question in the highest notes of the voice.</p>
<p class="p24">II.ii.362 (218,3) escoted] Paid.</p>
<p class="p24">II.ii.362 (218,4) Will they pursue quality no longer than they can <span class="t8">sing</span>?] Will they follow the <span class="t8">profession</span> of players no longer than they keep the voices of boys? So afterwards he says to the player, <span class="t8">Come, give us a taste of your</span> quality; come, <span class="t8">a passionate speech</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">II.ii.370 (219,6) to tarre them on to controversy] To provoke any animal to rage, is <span class="t8">to tarre him</span>. The word is said to come from the Greek. (1773)</p>
<p class="p24">II.ii.380 (219,8) It is not very strange, for mine uncle is king of Denmark] I do not wonder that the new players have so suddenly risen to reputation, my uncle supplies another example of the facility with which honour is conferred upon new claimants.</p>
<p class="p24">II.ii.412 (220,2) Buz, buz!] Mere idle talk, the <span class="t8">buz</span> of the vulgar.</p>
<p class="p24">II.ii.414 (220,3) <span class="t8">Then came each actor on his ass</span>] This seems to be a line of a ballad.</p>
<p class="p24">II.ii.420 (221,6) For the law of writ, and the liberty, these are the only men] All the modern editions have, <span class="t8">the law of</span> wit, <span class="t8">and the liberty</span>; but both my old copies have, <span class="t8">the law of</span> writ, I believe rightly. <span class="t8">Writ</span>, for <span class="t8">writing, composition</span>. <span class="t8">Wit</span> was not, in our author&rsquo;s time, taken either for <span class="t8">imagination</span>, or <span class="t8">acuteness</span>, or <span class="t8">both together</span>, but for <span class="t8">understanding</span>, for the faculty by which we <span class="t8">apprehend</span> and <span class="t8">judge</span>. Those who wrote of the human mind distinguished its primary powers into <span class="t8">wit</span> and <span class="t8">will</span>. Ascham distinguishes <span class="t8">boys</span> of tardy and of active faculties into <span class="t8">quick wits</span> and <span class="t8">slow wits</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">II.ii.438 (221,8) the first row of the pious chanson] [It is <span class="t8">pons chansons</span> in the first folio edition. POPE.] It is <span class="t8">pons chansons</span> in the quarto too. I know not whence the <span class="t8">rubric</span> has been brought, yet it has not the appearance of an arbitrary addition. The titles of old ballads were never printed red; but perhaps <span class="t8">rubric</span> may stand for <span class="t8">marginal explanation</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">II.ii.439 (222,9) For, look, where my abridgment comes] He calls the players afterwards, <span class="t8">the brief chronicles of the time</span>; but I think he now means only <span class="t8">those who will shorten my talk</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">II.ii.448 (223,2) be not crack&rsquo;d within the ring] That is, <span class="t8">crack&rsquo;d too much for use</span>. This is said to a young player who acted the parts of women.</p>
<p class="p24">II.ii.450 (223,3) like French faulconers] HANMER, who has much illustrated the allusions to falconry, reads, <span class="t8">like</span> French <span class="t8">falconers. [French falconers</span> is not a correction by Hanmer, but the reading of the first folio. STEEVENS.] (see 1765, VIII, 198, 1)</p>
<p class="p24">II.ii.459 (223,5) (as I received it, and others whose judgment in such matters cried in the top of mine)] [i.e. whose judgment I had the highest opinion of. WARBURTON.] I think it means only that <span class="t8">were higher than mine</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">II.ii.466 (224,8) but called it, an honest method] Hamlet is telling how much his judgment differed from that of others. <span class="t8">One said, there was no salt in the lines</span>, &amp;c. <span class="t8">but call&rsquo;d it an honest method</span>. The author probably gave it, <span class="t8">But I called it an honest method</span>, &amp;c.</p>
<p class="p24">II.ii.525 (226,9) <span class="t8">the mobled queen</span>] Mobled signifies <span class="t8">huddled, grossly covered</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">II.ii.587 (228,5) the cue for passion] The <span class="t8">hint</span>, the <span class="t8">direction</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">II.ii.589 (228,6) the general ear] The ears of all mankind. So before, <span class="t8">Caviare to the</span> general, that is, to the <span class="t8">multitude</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">II.ii.595 (229,7) unpregnant of my cause] [<span class="t8">Unpregnant</span>, for <span class="t8">having no due sense of</span>. WARBURTON.] Rather, <span class="t8">not quickened with a new desire of vengeance; not teeming with revenge</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">II.ii.598 (229,8) A damn&rsquo;d defeat was made] [<span class="t8">Defeat</span>, for <span class="t8">destruction</span>. WARBURTON.] Rather, <span class="t8">dispossession</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">II.ii.608 (229,1) kindless] <span class="t8">Unnatural</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">II.ii.616 (229,3) About, my brain!] <span class="t8">Wits, to your work</span>. <span class="t8">Brain</span>, go <span class="t8">about</span> the present business.</p>
<p class="p24">II.ii.625 (230,5) tent him] Search his wounds.</p>
<p class="p24">II.ii.632 (230,7) More relative than this] [<span class="t8">Relative</span>, for <span class="t8">convictive</span>. WARB.] <span class="t8">Convictive</span> is only the consequential sense. <span class="t8">Relative</span> is, <span class="t8">nearly related, closely connected</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">III.i.17 (231,2) o&rsquo;er-raught on the way] <span class="t8">Over-raught</span> is <span class="t8">over-reached</span>, that is, <span class="t8">over-took</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">III.i.31 (232,4) Affront Ophelia.] To <span class="t8">affront</span>, is only <span class="t8">to meet directly</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">III.i.47 (233,5) &rsquo;Tis too much prov&rsquo;d] It is found by too frequent experience.</p>
<p class="p24">III.i.52 (233,6) more ugly to the thing that helps it] That is, <span class="t8">compared with</span> the thing that helps it.</p>
<p class="p24">III.i.56-88 (233,7) To be, or not to be?] Of this celebrated soliloquy, which bursting from a man distracted with contrariety of desires, and overwhelmed with the magnitude of his own purposes, is connected rather in the speaker&rsquo;s mind, than on his tongue, I shall endeavour to discover the train, and to shew how one sentiment produces another. Hamlet, knowing himself injured in the most enormous and atrocious degree, and seeing no means of redress, but such as must expose him to the extremity of hazard, meditates on his situation in this manner: <span class="t8">Before I can form any rational scheme of action under this pressure of distress</span>, it is necessary to decide, whether, <span class="t8">after our present state, we are</span> to be or not to be. That is the question, which, as it shall be answered, will determine, <span class="t8">whether &rsquo;tis nobler</span>, and more suitable to the dignity of reason, <span class="t8">to suffer the outrages of fortune</span> patiently, or to take arms against <span class="t8">them</span>, and by opposing end them, <span class="t8">though perhaps</span> with the loss of life. If <span class="t8">to die</span>, were <span class="t8">to sleep</span>, no more, <span class="t8">and by a sleep to end</span> the miseries of our nature, such a sleep were <span class="t8">devoutly to be wished</span>; but if <span class="t8">to sleep</span> in death, be <span class="t8">to dream</span>, to retain our powers of sensibility, we must <span class="t8">pause</span> to consider, <span class="t8">in that sleep of death what dreams may come</span>. This consideration <span class="t8">makes calamity</span> so long endured; for <span class="t8">who would bear</span> the vexations of life, which might be ended <span class="t8">by a bare bodkin</span>, but that he is afraid of something in unknown futurity? This fear it is that gives efficacy to conscience, which, by turning the mind upon <span class="t8">this regard</span>, chills the ardour of <span class="t8">resolution</span>, checks the vigour of <span class="t8">enterprize</span>, and makes the <span class="t8">current</span> of desire stagnate in inactivity. We may suppose that he would have applied these general observations to his own case, but that he discovered Ophelia.</p>
<p class="p24">III.i.59 (234,8) Or to take arms against a sea of troubles] [W: against assail] Mr. Pope proposed <span class="t8">siege</span>. I know not why there should be so much solicitude about this metaphor. Shakespeare breaks his metaphors often, and in this desultory speech there was less need of preserving them.</p>
<p class="p24">III.i.70 (235,2) the whips and scorns of time] [W: of th&rsquo; time] I doubt whether the corruption of this passage is not more than the editor has suspected. <span class="t8">Whips</span> and <span class="t8">scorns</span> have no great connexion with one another, or with <span class="t8">time: whips</span> and <span class="t8">scorns</span> are evils of very different magnitude, and though at all <span class="t8">times scorn</span> may be endured, yet the <span class="t8">times</span> that put men ordinarily in danger of <span class="t8">whips</span>, are rery rare. Falstaff has said, that the <span class="t8">courtiers would</span> whip <span class="t8">him with their quick wits</span>; but I know not that <span class="t8">whip</span> can be used for a <span class="t8">scoff</span> or <span class="t8">insult</span>, unless its meaning be fixed by the whole expression.</p>
<p class="p24">I am afraid lest I should venture too far in correcting this passage. If <span class="t8">whips</span> be retained, we may read,</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">For who would bear the whips and scorns of</span> tyrant.</p>
<p class="p24">But I think that <span class="t8">quip</span>, a <span class="t8">sneer</span>, a <span class="t8">sarcasm</span>, a <span class="t8">contemptuous</span> jest, is the proper word, as suiting very exactly with <span class="t8">scorn</span>. What then must be done with <span class="t8">time</span>? it suits no better with the new reading than with the old, and <span class="t8">tyrant</span> is an image too bulky and serious. I read, but not confidently,</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">For who would bear the</span> quips <span class="t8">and scorns of</span> title.</p>
<p class="p24">It say be remarked, that Hamlet, in his enumeration of miseries, forgets, whether properly or not, that he is a prince, and mentions many evils to which inferior stations only are exposed.</p>
<p class="p24">III.i.77 (236,4) To groan and sweat] All the old copies have, <span class="t8">to</span> grunt <span class="t8">and sweat</span>. It is undoubtedly the true reading, but can scarcely be borne by modern ears.</p>
<p class="p24">III.i.89 (237,5) Nymph, in thy orisons] This is a touch of nature. Hamlet, at the sight of Ophelia, does not immediately recollect, that he is to personate madness, but makes her an address grave and solemn, such as the foregoing meditation excited in his thoughts.</p>
<p class="p24">III.i.107 (237,6) That if you be honest and fair, you should admit no discourse to your beauty] This is the reading of all the modern editions, and is copied from the quarto. The folio reads, your honesty <span class="t8">should admit no discourse to your beauty</span>. The true reading seems to be this, <span class="t8">If you be honest and fair, you should admit</span> your honesty <span class="t8">to no discourse with your beauty</span>. This is the sense evidently required by the process of the conversation.</p>
<p class="p24">III.i.127 (238,7) I have thoughts to put them in] <span class="t8">To put a thing into thought</span>, is <span class="t8">to think on it</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">III.i.148 (239,8) I have heard of your paintings too, well enough] This is according to the quarto; the folio, for <span class="t8">painting</span>, has <span class="t8">prattlings</span>, and for <span class="t8">face</span>, has <span class="t8">pace</span>, which agrees with what follows, <span class="t8">you jig, you amble</span>. Probably the author wrote both. I think the common reading best.</p>
<p class="p24">III.i.152 (239,9) make your wantonness your ignorance] You mistake by <span class="t8">wanton</span> affectation, and pretend to mistake by <span class="t8">ignorance</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">III.i.161 (239,2) the mould of form] The model by whom all endeavoured to form themselves.</p>
<p class="p24">III.ii.12 (241,3) the groundlings] The meaner people then seem to have sat below, as they now sit in the upper gallery, who, not well understanding poetical language, were sometimes gratified by a mimical and mute representation of the drama, previous to the dialogue.</p>
<p class="p24">III.ii.14 (242,4) inexplicable dumb shews] I believe the meaning is, <span class="t8">shews, without words to explain them</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">III.ii.26 (242,6) the very age and body of the time, his form and pressure] The <span class="t8">age</span> of the <span class="t8">time</span> can hardly pass. May we not read, the <span class="t8">face</span> and <span class="t8">body</span>, or did the author write, the <span class="t8">page</span>? The <span class="t8">page</span> suits well with <span class="t8">form</span> and <span class="t8">pressure</span>, but ill with <span class="t8">body</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">III.ii.28 (242,7) pressure] Resemblance, as in a <span class="t8">print</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">III.ii.34 (242,8) (not to speak it profanely)] <span class="t8">Profanely</span> seems to relate, not to the praise which he has mentioned, but to the censure which he is about to utter. Any gross or indelicate language was called <span class="t8">profane</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">III.ii.66 (243,9) the pregnant hinges of the knee] I believe the sense of <span class="t8">pregnant</span> in this place is, <span class="t8">quick, ready, prompt</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">III.ii.68 (244,1) my dear soul] Perhaps, my <span class="t8">clear</span> soul.</p>
<p class="p24">III.ii.74 (244,2) Whose blood and judgment] According to the doctrine of the four humours, <span class="t8">desire</span> and <span class="t8">confidence</span> were seated in the blood, and <span class="t8">judgment</span> in the phlegm, and the due mixture of the humours made a perfect character.</p>
<p class="p24">III.ii.89 (244,3) Vulcan&rsquo;s stithy] <span class="t8">Stithy</span> is a smith&rsquo;s <span class="t8">anvil</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">III.ii.103 (245,4) nor mine now] A man&rsquo;s words, says the proverb, are his own no longer than he keep them unspoken.</p>
<p class="p24">III.ii.112 (245,5) they stay upon your patience] May it not be read more intelligibly, <span class="t8">They stay upon your</span> pleasure. In <span class="t8">Macbeth</span> it is, &ldquo;Noble Macbeth, we stay upon your <span class="t8">leisure</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">III.ii.123 (245,6) Do you think I meant country matters?] I think we must read, <span class="t8">Do you think I meant country</span> manners? Do you imagine that I meant to sit in your lap, with such rough gallantry as clowns use to their lasses?</p>
<p class="p24">III.ii.137 (246,7) Nay, then, let the devil wear black, for I&rsquo;ll have a suit of sables] I know not why our editors should, with such implacable anger, persecute our predecessors. The dead, it is true, can make no resistance, they may be attacked with great security; but since they can neither feel nor mend, the safety of mauling them seems greater than the pleasure; nor perhaps would it much misbeseem us to remember, amidst our triumphs over the <span class="t8">nonsensical</span> and the <span class="t8">senseless</span>, that we likewise are men; that <span class="t8">debemur morti</span>, and, as Swift observed to Burnet, shall soon be among the dead ourselves.</p>
<p class="p24">I cannot find how the common reading is nonsense, nor why Hamlet, when he laid aside his dress of mourning, in a country where it was <span class="t8">bitter cold</span>, and the air was <span class="t8">nipping and eager</span>, should not have a <span class="t8">suit of sables</span>. I suppose it is well enough known, that the fur of sables is not black.</p>
<p class="p24">III.ii.147 (249,1) Marry, this is miching maliche; it means mischief] [W: malhechor] I think Hanmer&rsquo;s exposition most likely to be right. Dr. Warburton, to justify his interpretation, must write, <span class="t8">miching</span> for <span class="t8">malechor</span>, and even then it will be harsh.</p>
<p class="p24">III.ii.167 (250,3) sheen] Splendor, lustre.</p>
<p class="p24">III.ii.177 (250,4) For women fear too much, even as they love] Here seems to be a line lost, which should have rhymed to <span class="t8">love</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">III.ii.192 (251,6) The instances, that second marriage move] The <span class="t8">motives</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">III.ii.202 (252,7)</p>
<p class="p24">Most necessary &rsquo;tis, that we forget</p>
<p class="p24">To pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt]</p>
<p class="p24">The performance of a resolution, in which only the <span class="t8">resolver</span> is interested, is a debt only to himself, which he may therefore remit at pleasure.</p>
<p class="p24">III.ii.206 (252,8)</p>
<p class="p24">The violence of either grief or joy,</p>
<p class="p24">Their own enactures with themselves destroy]</p>
<p class="p24">What grief or joy <span class="t8">enact</span> or determine in their violence, is revealed in their abatement. <span class="t8">Enactures</span> is the word in the quarto; all the modern editions have <span class="t8">enactors</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">III.ii.229 (252,9) An anchor&rsquo;s cheer in prison be my scope] May my whole liberty and enjoyment be to live on hermit&rsquo;s fare in a prison. <span class="t8">Anchor</span> is for <span class="t8">anchoret</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">III.ii.250 (253,1) Baptista] <span class="t8">Baptista</span> is, I think, in Italian, the name always of a man.</p>
<p class="p24">III.ii.262 (254,4) So you must take your husbands] Read, <span class="t8">So you</span> must take <span class="t8">your husbands</span> [in place of &ldquo;mistake&rdquo;]; that is, <span class="t8">for better, for worse</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">III.ii.288 (255,5) with two provencial roses on my rayed shoes] When shoe-strings were worn, they were covered, where they met in the middle, by a ribband, gathered into the form of a rose. So in an old song,</p>
<p class="p24">Gil-de-Roy <span class="t8">was a bonny boy</span>,</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Had</span> roses <span class="t8">tull his</span> shoen.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Rayed</span> shoes, are shoes <span class="t8">braided</span> in lines.</p>
<p class="p24">III.ii.304 (256,1) For if the king like not the comedy/Why, then, belike] Hamlet was going on to draw the consequence when the courtiers entered.</p>
<p class="p24">III.ii.314 (256,2) With drink, Sir?] Hamlet takes particular care that his uncle&rsquo;s love of drink shall not be forgotten.</p>
<p class="p24">III.ii.346 (257,3) further trade] Further business; further dealing.</p>
<p class="p24">III.ii.348 (257,4) by these pickers] By these hands.</p>
<p class="p24">III.ii.373 (258,6) ventages] The holes of a flute.</p>
<p class="p24">III.ii.401 (259,9) they fool me to the top of my bent] They compel me to play the fool, till I can endure to do it no longer.</p>
<p class="p24">III.iii.7 (261,4) Out of his lunes] [The old quartos read,</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Out of his</span> brows.</p>
<p class="p24">This was from the ignorance of the first editors; as is this unnecessary Alexandrine, which we owe to the players. The poet, I am persuaded, wrote,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&mdash; <span class="t8">us doth hourly grow</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">out of his</span> lunes.</p>
<p class="p24">i.e. his <span class="t8">madness, frenzy</span>. THEOBALD.]</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Lunacies</span> is the reading of the folio.</p>
<p class="p24">I take <span class="t8">brows</span> to be, properly read, <span class="t8">frows</span>, which, I think, is a provincial word for <span class="t8">perverse humours</span>; which being, I suppose, not understood, was changed to <span class="t8">lunacies</span>. But of this I an not confident. [Steevens adopted Theobald&rsquo;s emendation]</p>
<p class="p24">III.iii.33 (262,7) of vantage] By some opportunity of secret observation.</p>
<p class="p24">III.iii.56 (263,9) May one be pardon&rsquo;d, and retain the offence?] He that does not amend what can be amended, <span class="t8">retains</span> his <span class="t8">offence</span>. The king kept the crown from the right heir.</p>
<p class="p24">III.iii.66 (263,1) Yet what can it, when one cannot repent?] What can repentance <span class="t8">do for a man that cannot be penitent</span>, for a man who has only part of penitence, distress of conscience, without the other part, resolution of amendment.</p>
<p class="p24">III.iii.77 (264,1) I, his sole son, do this same villain send] The folio reads foule son, a reading apparently corrupted from the quarto. The meaning is plain. <span class="t8">I, his</span> only <span class="t8">son</span>, who am bound to punish his murderer.</p>
<p class="p24">III.iii.88 (264,2) Up, sword, and know thou a more horrid hent] [T: bent] This reading is followed by Sir T. HANMER and Dr. WARBURTON; but <span class="t8">hent</span> is probably the right vord. To <span class="t8">hent</span> is used by Shakespeare for, to <span class="t8">seize</span>, to <span class="t8">catch</span>, to <span class="t8">lay hold on</span>. <span class="t8">Hent</span> is, therefore, <span class="t8">hold</span>, or <span class="t8">seizure</span>. <span class="t8">Lay hold</span> on him, sword, at a more horrid time.</p>
<p class="p24">III.iii.94 (265,3) his soul may be as damn&rsquo;d and black/As hell, whereto it goes] This speech, in which Hamlet, represented as a virtuous character, is not content vith taking blood for blood, but contrives damnation for the man that he would punish, is too horrible to be read or to be uttered.</p>
<p class="p24">III.iv.4 (266,4) I&rsquo;ll silence me e&rsquo;en here:/Pray you, be round vith him] Sir T. HANMER, who is folloved by Dr. WARBURTON, reads,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&mdash; <span class="t8">I&rsquo;ll</span> sconce <span class="t8">me here</span>.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Retire</span> to a place of <span class="t8">security</span>. They forget that the contrivance of Polonius to overhear the conference, was no more told to the queen than to Hamlet. &mdash; <span class="t8">I&rsquo;ll silence me even here</span>, is, <span class="t8">I&rsquo;ll use no more words</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">III.iv.48 (268,8)</p>
<p class="p24">Heaven&rsquo;s face doth glow;</p>
<p class="p24">Yea, this solidity and compound mass,</p>
<p class="p24">With tristful visage, as against the doom,</p>
<p class="p24">It thought-sick at the act]</p>
<p class="p24">[W: O&rsquo;er this ... visage, and, as &lsquo;gainst] The word <span class="t8">heated</span> [from the &ldquo;old quarto&rdquo;], though it agrees well enough with <span class="t8">glow</span>, is, I think, not so striking as <span class="t8">tristful</span>, which was, I suppose, chosen at the revisal. I believe the whole passage now stands as the author gave it. Dr. WARBURTON&rsquo;s reading restores two improprieties, which Shakespeare, by his alteration, had removed. In the first, and in the new reading: <span class="t8">Heaven&rsquo;s</span> face <span class="t8">glows with tristful</span> visage; and, <span class="t8">Heaven&rsquo;s face is</span> thought-sick. To the common reading there is no just objection.</p>
<p class="p24">III.iv.52 (268,9) what act,/That roars so loud, and thunders in the index?] The meaning is, <span class="t8">What is</span> this act, of which the <span class="t8">discovery</span>, or <span class="t8">mention</span>, cannot be made, but with this violence of clamour?</p>
<p class="p24">III.iv.82 (270,5) Rebellious hell,/If thou canst mutiny in a matron&rsquo;s bones] I think the present reading right, but cannot admit that HANMER&rsquo;s emendation [&ldquo;Rebellious heat&rdquo;] produces nonsense. May not what is said of <span class="t8">heat</span>, be said of <span class="t8">hell</span>, that it will mutiny wherever it is quartered? Though the emendation be elegant, it is not necessary. (1773)</p>
<p class="p24">III.iv.88 (271,6) reason panders will] So the folio, I think rightly; but the reading of the quarto is defensible;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&mdash; <span class="t8">reason</span> pardons <span class="t8">will</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">III.iv.90 (271,7) grained] Dyed in grain.</p>
<p class="p24">III.iv.92 (271,8) incestuous bed] The folio has <span class="t8">enseamed</span>, that is, <span class="t8">greasy</span> bed.</p>
<p class="p24">III.iv.98 (271,9) vice of kings!] a low mimick of kings. The vice is the fool of a farce; from whom the modern <span class="t8">punch</span> is descended.</p>
<p class="p24">III.iv.102 (272,2) A king of shreds and patches] This is said, pursuing the idea of the <span class="t8">vice of kings</span>. The <span class="t8">vice</span> was dressed as a fool, in a coat of party-coloured patches.</p>
<p class="p24">III.iv.107 (272,3) lap&rsquo;s in time and passion] That, having suffered <span class="t8">time</span> to <span class="t8">slip</span>, and <span class="t8">passion</span> to <span class="t8">cool, lets go</span>, &amp;c.</p>
<p class="p24">III.iv.151 (274,6) And do not spread the compost on the weeds/To make them ranker] Do not, by any new indulgence, heighten your former offences.</p>
<p class="p24">III.iv.155 (274,7) curb] That is, <span class="t8">bend</span> and <span class="t8">truckle</span>. Fr. <span class="t8">courber</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">III.iv.161 (274,8) That monster custom, who all sense doth eat/ Of habits evil, is angel yet in this] [Thirlby: habits evil] I think THIRLBY&rsquo;s conjecture wrong, though the succeeding editors have followed it; <span class="t8">angel</span> and <span class="t8">devil</span> are evidently opposed. [Steevens accepted &ldquo;evil&rdquo;]</p>
<p class="p24">III.iv.203 (277,5) adders fang&rsquo;d] That is, adders with their <span class="t8">fangs</span>, or <span class="t8">poisonous teeth</span>, undrawn. It has been the practice of mountebanks to boast the efficacy of their antidotes by playing with vipers, but they first disabled their fangs.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.i (278,l) <span class="t8">A royal apartment. Enter King, Queen, Rosencrantz, and Guildenstern</span>] This play is printed in the old editions without any separation of the acts. The division is modern and arbitrary; and is here not very happy, for the pause is made at a time when there is more continuity of action than in almost any other of the scenes.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.i.18 (278,2) out of haunt] I would rather read, <span class="t8">out of</span> harm.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.i.25 (279,3)</p>
<p class="p24">his very madness, like some ore</p>
<p class="p24">among a mineral of metals base,</p>
<p class="p24">Shews itself pure]</p>
<p class="p24">Shakespeare seems to think <span class="t8">ore</span> to be <span class="t8">or</span>, that is, gold. Base metals have <span class="t8">ore</span> no less than precious.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.ii.19 (281,5) he keeps them, like an ape, in the corner of his jaw] The quarto has <span class="t8">apple</span>, which is generally followed. The folio has <span class="t8">ape</span>, which HANMER has received, and illustrated with the following note.</p>
<p class="p24">&ldquo;It is the way of monkeys in eating, to throw that part of their food, which they take up first, into a pouch they are provided with on the side of their jaw, and then they keep it, till they have done with the rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">IV.ii.28 (281,6) The body is with the king] This answer I do not comprehend. Perhaps it should be, <span class="t8">The body is</span> not <span class="t8">with the king</span>, for <span class="t8">the king is not with the body</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.ii.32 (282,7) Of nothing] Should it not be read, <span class="t8">Or</span> nothing? When the courtiers remark, that Hamlet has contemptuously called the <span class="t8">king a thing</span>, Hamlet defends himself by observing, that the king must be a <span class="t8">thing</span>, or <span class="t8">nothing</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.ii.46 (283,9) the wind at help] I suppose it should be read, <span class="t8">The bark is ready, and the wind at</span> helm.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.ii.68 (284,3) And thou must cure me: till I know &rsquo;tis done,/ Howe&rsquo;er my haps, my joys will ne&rsquo;er begin] This being the termination of a scene, should, according to our author&rsquo;s custom, be rhymed. Perhaps he wrote,</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Howe&rsquo;er my</span> hopes, <span class="t8">my joys</span> are not begun.</p>
<p class="p24">If <span class="t8">haps</span> be retained, the meaning will be, <span class="t8">&lsquo;till I know &rsquo;tis done, I shall be miserable</span>, whatever befall me (see 1785, VIII, 257, 3)</p>
<p class="p24">IV.iv.33 (286,4)</p>
<p class="p24">What is a man,</p>
<p class="p24">If his chief good and market of his time</p>
<p class="p24">Be but to sleep and feed?]</p>
<p class="p24">If his highest good, and <span class="t8">that for which he sells his time</span>, be to sleep and feed.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.iv.36 (286,5) large discourse] Such latitude of comprehension, such power of reviewing the past, and anticipating the future.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.iv.53 (286,6) Rightly to be great,/Is not to stir without great argument] This passage I have printed according to the copy. Mr. THEOBALD had regulated it thus:</p>
<p class="p24">&mdash; &rsquo;Tis<span class="t8"> not to be great,</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Never to stir without great argument;</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">But greatly</span>, &amp;c.</p>
<p class="p24">The sentiment of Shakespeare is partly just, and partly romantic.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&mdash; <span class="t8">Rightly to be great,</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Is not to stir without great argument</span>;</p>
<p class="p24">is exactly philosophical.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">But greatly to find quarrel in a straw,</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">When honour is at stake</span>,</p>
<p class="p24">is the idea of a modern hero. <span class="t8">But then</span>, says he <span class="t8">honour is an argument, or subject of debate</span>, sufficiently great, <span class="t8">and</span> when honour is at stake, we must <span class="t8">find cause of quarrel in a straw</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.iv.56 (287,7) Excitements of my reason and my blood] Provocations which excite both my reason and my passions to vengeance.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.v.37 (289,4) <span class="t8">Larded all with sweet flowers</span>] The expression is taken from cookery. (1773)</p>
<p class="p24">IV.v.53 (290,6) <span class="t8">And dupt the chamber-door</span>] To <span class="t8">dup</span>, is to <span class="t8">do up</span>; to lift the latch. It were easy to write,</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">And</span> op&rsquo;d &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">IV.v.58 (290,7) <span class="t8">By Gis</span>] I rather imagine it should be read,</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">By</span> Cis, &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">That is, by St. Cecily.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.v.83 (291,8) but greenly] But <span class="t8">unskilfully</span>; with <span class="t8">greenness</span>; that is, without <span class="t8">maturity</span> of judgment.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.v.84 (291,9) In hugger-mugger to inter him] All the modern editions that I have consulted give it,</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">In</span> private <span class="t8">to inter him</span>; &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">That the words now replaced are better, I do not undertake to prove; it is sufficient that they are Shakespeare&rsquo;s: if phraseology is to be changed as words grow uncouth by disuse, or gross by vulgarity, the history of every language will be lost; we shall no longer have the words of any author; and, as these alterations will be often unskilfully made, we shall in time have very little of his meaning.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.v.89 (292,1) Feeds on his wonder] The folio reads,</p>
<p class="p24">Keeps <span class="t8">on his wonder</span>, &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">The quarto,</p>
<p class="p24">Feeds <span class="t8">on</span> this <span class="t8">wonder</span>. &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">Thus the true reading is picked out from between them. HANMER reads unnecessarily,</p>
<p class="p24">Feeds <span class="t8">on his</span> anger. &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">IV.v.92 (292,2) Wherein necessity, of matter beggar&rsquo;d,/ Will nothing stick our persons to arraign] HANMER reads,</p>
<p class="p24">Whence animosity, <span class="t8">of matter beggar&rsquo;d</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">He seems not to have understood the connection. <span class="t8">Wherein</span>, that is, <span class="t8">in which pestilent speeches, necessity</span>, or, <span class="t8">the obligation of an accuser to support his charge, will nothing stick</span>, &amp;c.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.v.99 (293,4) The ocean, over-peering of his list] The lists are the barriers which the spectators of a tournament must not pass.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.v.105 (293,5) The ratifiers and props of every ward] [W: ward] With this emendation, which was in Theobald&rsquo;s edition, Hanmer was not satisfied. It is indeed harsh. HANMER transposes the lines, and reads,</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">They cry</span>, &ldquo;Chuse we Laertes for our king;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">The ratifiers and props of every word,</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Caps, hands, and tongues, applaud it to the clouds</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">I think the fault may be mended at less expence, by reading,</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Antiquity forgot, custom not known,</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">The ratifiers and props of every</span> weal.</p>
<p class="p24">That is, of every <span class="t8">government</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.v.110 (294,6) Oh, this is counter, you false Danish dogs] Hounds run <span class="t8">counter</span> when they trace the trail backwards.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.v.161 (296,9)</p>
<p class="p24">Nature is fine in loves and, where &rsquo;tis fine,</p>
<p class="p24">It sends some precious instance of itself</p>
<p class="p24">After the thing it loves]</p>
<p class="p24">These lines are not in the quarto, and might hare been omitted in the folio without great loss, for they are obscure and affected; but, I think, they require no emendation. <span class="t8">Love</span> (says Laertes) is the passion by which <span class="t8">nature is most</span> exalted and <span class="t8">refined</span>; and as substances <span class="t8">refined</span> and subtilised, easily obey any impulse, or follow any attraction, some part of nature, so purified and <span class="t8">refined</span>, flies off after the attracting object, after the thing it loves.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">As into air the purer spirits f1ow,</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">And separate from their kindred dregs below,</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">So flew her soul</span>. &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">IV.v.171 (297,1) O how the wheel becomes it!] [W: weal] I do not see why <span class="t8">weal</span> is better than <span class="t8">wheel</span>. The story alluded to I do not know; but perhaps the lady stolen by the steward was reduced to <span class="t8">spin</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.v.175 (297,2) There&rsquo;s rosemary, that&rsquo;ll far rememberance. Pray you, love, remember. And there&rsquo;s pansies, that&rsquo;s for thoughts] There is probably some mythology in the choice of these herbs, but I cannot explain it. <span class="t8">Pansies</span> is for <span class="t8">thoughts</span>, because of its name, <span class="t8">Pensées</span>; but <span class="t8">rosemary</span> indicates <span class="t8">remembrance</span>, except that it is an ever-green, and carried at funerals, I have not discovered.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.v.214 (300,7) No trophy, sword, nor batchment] It was the custom, in the times of our author, to hang a sword over the grave of a knight.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.v.218 (300,8) And where the offence is, let the great axe fall] [W: tax] <span class="t8">Fall</span> corresponds better to <span class="t8">axe</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.vi.26 (301,9) <span class="t8">for the bore of the matter</span>] The <span class="t8">bore</span> is the calibier of a gun, or the capacity of the barrel. <span class="t8">The matter</span> (says Hamlet) <span class="t8">would carry the heavier words</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.vii.18 (302,1) the general gender] The <span class="t8">common race</span> of the people.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.vii.19 (302,2)</p>
<p class="p24">dipping all his faults in their affection,</p>
<p class="p24">Would, like the spring that turneth wood to stone,</p>
<p class="p24">Convert his gyves to graces]</p>
<p class="p24">This simile is neither very seasonable in the deep interest of this conversation, nor very accurately applied. If the <span class="t8">spring</span> had changed base metals to gold, the thought had been more proper.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.vii.27 (302,3) if praises may go back again] If I may praise what has been, but is now to be found no more.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.vii.77 (304,5) Of the unworthiest siege] Of the lowest rank. <span class="t8">Siege</span>, for <span class="t8">seat, place</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.vii.82 (304,6) Importing health and graveness] [W: wealth] <span class="t8">Importing</span> here may be, not <span class="t8">inferring</span> by logical consequence, but <span class="t8">producing</span> by physical effect. A young man regards show in his dress, an old man, <span class="t8">health</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.vii.90 (305,7) I, in forgery of shapes and tricks/Come short of what he did] I could not contrive so many proofs of dexterity as he could perform.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.vii.98 (305,8) in your defence] That is, <span class="t8">in the science of</span> defence.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.vii.101 (305,9) The scrimers] The <span class="t8">fencers</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.vii.112 (305,1) love is begun by time] This is obscure. The meaning may be, <span class="t8">love</span> is not innate in us, and co-essential to our nature, but begins at a certain time from some external cause, and being always subject to the operations of time, suffers change and diminution. (1773)</p>
<p class="p24">IV.vii.113 (300,2) in passages of proof] In transactions of daily experience.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.vii.123 (306,4) And then this <span class="t8">should</span> is like a spendthrift sigh/ That hurts by easing] [W: sign] This conjecture is so ingenious, that it can hardly be opposed, but with the same reluctance as the bow is drawn against a hero, whose virtues the archer holds in veneration. Here may be applied what Voltaire writes to the empress:</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Le genereux Francois &mdash; </span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Te combat &amp; t&rsquo;admire.</span></p>
<p class="p24">Yet this emendation, however specious, is mistaken. The original reading is, not a <span class="t8">spendthrift&rsquo;s</span> sigh, but a <span class="t8">spendthrift</span> sigh; a <span class="t8">sigh</span> that makes an unnecessary waste of the vital flame. It is a notion very prevalent, that <span class="t8">sighs</span> impair the strength, and wear out the animal powers.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.vii.135 (307,5) He being remiss] He being not vigilant or cautious.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.vii.139 (307,7) a pass of practice] Practice is often by Shakespeare, and other writers, taken for an <span class="t8">insidious stratagem</span>, or <span class="t8">privy</span> treason, a sense not incongruous to this passage, where yet I rather believe, that nothing more is meant than a <span class="t8">thrust for exercise</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.vii.151 (308,8) May fit us to our shape] May <span class="t8">enable</span> us to <span class="t8">assume proper characters</span>, and to act our part.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.vii.155 (308,9) blast in proof] This, I believe, is a metaphor taken from a mine, which, in the proof or execution, sometimes breaks out with an ineffectual <span class="t8">blast</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">V.i.3 (310,1) make her grave straight] Make her grave from east to west in a direct line parallel to the church; not from north to south, athwart the regular line. This, I think, is meant.</p>
<p class="p24">V.i.87 (313,1) which this ass now o&rsquo;er-reaches] In the quarto, for <span class="t8">over-offices</span> is, <span class="t8">over-reaches</span>, which agrees better with the sentence: it is a strong exaggeration to remark that an <span class="t8">ass</span> can <span class="t8">over-reach</span> him who would once have tried to <span class="t8">circumvent</span>. &mdash; I believe both the words were Shakespeare&rsquo;s. An author in revising his work, when his original ideas have faded from his mind, and new observations have produced new sentiments, easily introduces images which have been more newly impressed upon him, without observing their want of congruity to the general texture of his original design.</p>
<p class="p24">V.i.96 (314,2) and now my lady Worm&rsquo;s] The scull that was <span class="t8">my lord Such a one&rsquo;s</span>, is now my <span class="t8">lady Worm&rsquo;s</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">V.i.100 (314,3) to play at loggats with &lsquo;em?] A play, in which pins are set up to be beaten down with a bowl.</p>
<p class="p24">V.i.149 (316,5) by the card] The <span class="t8">card</span> is the paper on which the different points of the compass were described. <span class="t8">To do any thing by the card</span>, is, <span class="t8">to do it with nice observation</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">V.i.151 (316,6) the age is grown so picked] So <span class="t8">smart</span>, so <span class="t8">sharp</span>, says HANMER, very properly; but there was, I think, about that time, a <span class="t8">picked</span> shoe, that is, <span class="t8">a shoe with a long pointed toe</span>, in fashion, to which the allusion seems likewise to be made. <span class="t8">Every man now is smart; and every man now is a man of fashion</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">V.i.239 (319,7) winter&rsquo;s flaw!] Winter&rsquo;s <span class="t8">blast</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">V.i.242 (319,8) maimed rites!] Imperfect obsequies.</p>
<p class="p24">V.i.244 (319,9) some estate] Some person of high rank.</p>
<p class="p24">V.i.255 (319,2) Yet here she is allow&rsquo;d her virgin crants] I have been informed by an anonymous correspondent, that <span class="t8">crants</span> is the German word for <span class="t8">garlands</span>, and I suppose it was retained by us from the Saxons. To carry <span class="t8">garlands</span> before the bier of a maiden, and to hang them over her grave, is still the practice in rural parishes.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Crants</span> therefore was the original word, which the author, discovering it to be provincial, and perhaps not understood, changed to a term more intelligible, but less proper. <span class="t8">Maiden rites</span> give no certain or definite image. He might have put <span class="t8">maiden wreaths</span>, or <span class="t8">maiden garlands</span>, but he perhaps bestowed no thought upon it, and neither genius nor practice will always supply a hasty writer with the most proper diction.</p>
<p class="p24">V.i.310 (323,6) When that her golden couplets] [W: E&rsquo;er that] Perhaps it should be,</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Ere yet</span> &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Yet</span> and <span class="t8">that</span> are easily confounded.</p>
<p class="p24">V.ii.6 (324,7) mutinies in the bilboes] <span class="t8">Mutinies</span>, the French word for seditious or disobedient fellows in the army or fleet. <span class="t8">Bilboes</span>, the <span class="t8">ship&rsquo;s prison</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">V.ii.6 (324,8) Rashly,/And prais&rsquo;d be rashness for it &mdash; Let us know] Both my copies read,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&mdash; Rashly,</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">And prais&rsquo;d be rashness for it</span>, let <span class="t8">us know</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">Hamlet, delivering an account of his escape, begins with saying, that he <span class="t8">rashly</span> &mdash; and then is carried into a reflection upon the weakness of human wisdom. I rashly &mdash; praised be rashness for it &mdash; <span class="t8">Let us</span> not think these events casual, but <span class="t8">let us know</span>, that is, <span class="t8">take notice and remember</span>, that we sometimes succeed by <span class="t8">indiscretion</span>, when we <span class="t8">fail</span> by <span class="t8">deep plots</span>, and infer the perpetual superintendance and <span class="t8">agency</span> of the <span class="t8">Divinity</span>. The observation is just, and will be allowed by every human being who shall reflect on the course of his own life.</p>
<p class="p24">V.ii.22 (325,9) With, ho! such bugs and goblins in my life] With <span class="t8">such causes of terror</span>, arising from my character and designs.</p>
<p class="p24">V.ii.29 (325,2) Being thus benetted round with villainies,/ Ere I could make a prologue to my brains] [W: mark the prologue ... bane] In my opinion no alteration is necessary. Hamlet is telling how luckily every thing fell out; he groped out their commission in the dark without waking them; he found himself doomed to immediate destruction. Something was to be done for his preservation. An expedient occurred, not produced by the comparison of one method with another, or by a regular deduction of consequences, but before he <span class="t8">could make a prologue to his brains, they had begun the play</span>. Before he could summon his faculties, and propose to himself what should be done, a complete scheme of action presented itself to him. His mind operated before he had excited it. This appears to me to be the meaning.</p>
<p class="p24">V.ii.41 (326,5) As peace should still her wheaten garland wear,/ And stand a comma &lsquo;tween their amities] HANMER reads,</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">And stand a</span> cement &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">I am again inclined to vindicate the old reading.</p>
<p class="p24">The expression of our author is, like many of his phrases, sufficiently constrained and affected, but it is not incapable of explanation. The <span class="t8">comma</span> is the note of <span class="t8">connection</span> and continuity of sentences; the <span class="t8">period</span> is the note of <span class="t8">abruption</span> and disjunction. Shakespeare had it perhaps in his mind to write, That unless England complied with the mandate, <span class="t8">war should put a</span> period <span class="t8">to their amity</span>; he altered his mode of diction, and thought that, in an opposite sense, he might put, that <span class="t8">Peace should stand a</span> comma between their amities. This is not an easy stile; but is it not the stile of Shakespeare?</p>
<p class="p24">V.ii.43 (327,6) as&rsquo;s of great charge] <span class="t8">Asses</span> heavily <span class="t8">loaded</span>. A quibble is intended between <span class="t8">as</span> the conditional particle, and <span class="t8">ass</span> the beast of burthen. That <span class="t8">charg&rsquo;d</span> anciently signified <span class="t8">leaded</span>, may be proved from the following passage in <span class="t8">The Widow&rsquo;s Tears</span>, by Chapman, 1612.</p>
<p class="p24">&ldquo;Thou must be the <span class="t8">ass charg&rsquo;d with crowns</span> to make way.&rdquo; (see 1765, VIII, 294, 2)</p>
<p class="p24">V.ii.53 (327,7) The changeling never known] A <span class="t8">changeling</span> is a <span class="t8">child</span> which the fairies are supposed to leave in the room of that which they steal.</p>
<p class="p24">V.ii.68 (328,1) To quit him] To requite him; to pay him his due.</p>
<p class="p24">V.ii.84 (329,2) Dost know this water-fly] A <span class="t8">water-fly</span>, skips up and down upon the surface of the water, without any apparent purpose or reason, and is thence the proper emblem of a busy trifler.</p>
<p class="p24">V.ii.89 (329,3) It is a chough] A kind of jackdaw.</p>
<p class="p24">V.ii.112 (330,5) full of most excellent differences] Full of <span class="t8">distinguishing</span> excellencies.</p>
<p class="p24">V.ii.114 (330,6) the card or calendar of gentry] The general preceptor of elegance; the <span class="t8">card</span> by which a gentleman is to direct his course; the <span class="t8">calendar</span> by which he is to choose his time, that what he does may be both excellent and seasonable.</p>
<p class="p24">V.ii.115 (330,7) for you shall find in him the continent of what part a gentleman would see] <span class="t8">You shall find him containing</span> and comprising every <span class="t8">quality</span> which a <span class="t8">gentleman</span> would desire to <span class="t8">contemplate</span> for imitation. I know not but it should be read, <span class="t8">You shall find him the continent</span></p>
<p class="p24">V.ii.119 (330,9) and yet but raw neither in respect of his quick sail] [W: but slow] I believe <span class="t8">raw</span> to be the right word; it is a word of great latitude; <span class="t8">raw</span> signifies <span class="t8">unripe, immature</span>, thence <span class="t8">unformed, imperfect, unskilful</span>. The best account of him would be <span class="t8">imperfect</span>, in respect of his quick sail. The phrase <span class="t8">quick sail</span> was, I suppose, a proverbial term for <span class="t8">activity of mind</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">V.ii.122 (330,1) a soul of great article] This is obscure. I once thought it might have been, <span class="t8">a soul of great altitude</span>; but, I suppose, <span class="t8">a soul of great article</span>, means <span class="t8">a soul of</span> large comprehension, of many contents; the particulars of an inventory are called <span class="t8">articles</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">V.ii.122 (331,2) his infusion of such dearth and rareness] <span class="t8">Dearth</span> is <span class="t8">dearness</span>, value, price. And his internal qualities of such value and rarity.</p>
<p class="p24">V.ii.131 (331,3) Is&rsquo;t not possible to understand in another tongue? you will do&rsquo;t, Sir, really] Of this interrogatory remark the sense ie very obscure. The question may mean, <span class="t8">Might not all this be understood in plainer language</span>. But then, <span class="t8">you will do it, Sir, really</span>, seems to have no use, for who could doubt but plain language would be intelligible? I would therefore read, <span class="t8">Is&rsquo;t possible</span> not to be understood in a mother <span class="t8">tongue</span>. You will do it, Sir, really.</p>
<p class="p24">V.ii.140 (331,4) if you did, it would not much approve me] If you knew I was not ignorant, your esteem would not nuch advance my reputation. To <span class="t8">approve</span>, is to <span class="t8">recommend to approbation</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">V.ii.145 (331,5) I dare not confess that, lest I should compare with him in excellence] I dare not pretend to know him, lest I should pretend to an equality: no man can completely know another, but by knowing himself, which is the utmost extent of human wisdom.</p>
<p class="p24">V.ii.149 (332,6) in his meed] In his excellence.</p>
<p class="p24">V.ii.156 (332,7) impon&rsquo;d] Perhaps it should be, <span class="t8">depon&rsquo;d</span>. So Hudibras,</p>
<p class="p24">&ldquo;I would upon this cause <span class="t8">depone</span>,</p>
<p class="p24">&ldquo;As much as any I have known.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">But perhaps <span class="t8">imponed</span> is pledged, <span class="t8">impawned</span>, so spelt to ridicule the affectation of uttering English words with French pronunciation.</p>
<p class="p24">V.ii.165 (332,9) more germane.] More<span class="t8">a-kin</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">V.ii.172 (333,1) The king, Sir, hath laid, that in a dozen passes between yourself and him, he shall not exceed you three hits; he hath laid on twelve for nine] This wager I do not understand. In a dozen passes one must exceed the other more or less than three hits. Nor can I comprehend, how, in a dozen, there can be twelve to nine. The passage is of no importance; it is sufficient that there was a wager. The quarto has the passage as it stands. The folio, <span class="t8">He hath one twelve for mine</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">V.ii.193 (333,2) This lapwing runs away with the shell on his head] I see no particular propriety in the image of the lapwing. Osrick did not run till he had done his business. We may read, <span class="t8">This lapwing</span> ran <span class="t8">away</span> &mdash; That is, <span class="t8">this fellow was full of unimportant bustle from his birth</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">V.ii.199 (334,4) a kind of yesty collection, which carries them through and through the most fond and winnowed opinions] [W: most fann&rsquo;d] This is a very happy emendation; but I know not why the critic should suppose that <span class="t8">fond</span> was printed for <span class="t8">fann&rsquo;d</span> in consequence of any reason or reflection. Such errors, to which there is no temptation but idleness, and of which there was no cause but ignorance, are in every page of the old editions. This passage in the quarto stands thus: &ldquo;They have got out of the habit of encounter, a kind of misty collection, which carries them through and through the most profane and renowned opinions.&rdquo; If this printer preserved any traces of the original, our author wrote, &ldquo;the most fane and renowned opinions,&rdquo; which is better than fann&rsquo;d and winnow&rsquo;d.</p>
<p class="p24">The meaning is, &ldquo;these men have got the cant of the day, a superficial readiness of slight and cursory conversation, a kind of frothy collection of fashionable prattle, which yet carried them through the most select and approved judgment. This airy facility of talk sometimes imposes upon wise men.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Who has not seen this observation verified?</p>
<p class="p24">V.ii.201 (335,6) and do but blow them to their trials, the bubbles are out] These men of show, without solidity, are like bubbles raised from soap and water, which dance, and glitter, and please the eye, but if you extend them, by blowing hard, separate into a mist; so if you oblige these specious talkers to extend their compass of conversation, they at once discover the tenuity of their intellects.</p>
<p class="p24">V.ii.216 (335,7) gentle entertainment] Mild and temperate conversation.</p>
<p class="p24">V.ii.234 (336,1) Since no man knows aught of what he leaves, what is&rsquo;t to leave betimes?] The reading of the quarto was right, but in some other copy the harshness of the transposition was softened, and the passage stood thus: <span class="t8">Since no man knows aught of what he leaves</span>. For <span class="t8">knows</span> was printed in the later copies <span class="t8">has</span>, by a slight blunder in such typographers.</p>
<p class="p24">I do not think Dr. Warburton&rsquo;s interpretation of the passage the best that it will admit. The meaning may be this, Since <span class="t8">no man knows aught of</span> the state of life which <span class="t8">he leaves</span>, since he cannot judge what others years may produce, why should he be afraid of <span class="t8">leaving</span> life betimes? Why should he dread an early death, of which he cannot tell whether it is an exclusion of happiness, or an interception of calamity. I despise the superstition of augury and omens, which has no ground in reason or piety; my comfort is, that I cannot fall but by the direction of Providence.</p>
<p class="p24">Hanmer has, <span class="t8">Since no man</span> owes <span class="t8">aught</span>, a conjecture not very reprehensible. Since <span class="t8">no man can call any possession certain</span>, what is it to leave?</p>
<p class="p24">V.ii.237 (337,2) Give me your pardon, Sir] I wish Hamlet had made some other defence; it is unsuitable to the character of a good or a brave man, to shelter himself in falsehood.</p>
<p class="p24">V.ii.272 (338,5) Your grace hath laid upon the weaker side] Thus Hanmer. All the others read,</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Your grace hath laid the odds o&rsquo; the weaker side.</span></p>
<p class="p24">When the odds were on the side of Laertes, who was to hit Hamlet twelve times to nine, it was perhaps the author&rsquo;s slip.</p>
<p class="p24">V.ii.310 (340,7) you make a wanton of me] A <span class="t8">wanton</span> was, a man feeble and effeminate. In <span class="t8">Cymbeline</span>, Imogen says,</p>
<p class="p24">&ldquo;I am not so citizen a <span class="t8">wanton</span>,</p>
<p class="p24">To die, ere I be sick.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">V.ii.346 (342,8) That are but mutes or audience to this act] That are either mere <span class="t8">auditors</span> of this <span class="t8">catastrophe</span>, or at most only <span class="t8">mute performers</span>, that fill the stage without any part in the action.</p>
<p class="p24">V.ii.375 (344,2) This quarry cries, on havock!] Hanmer reads,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&mdash; <span class="t8">cries</span> out, <span class="t8">havock!</span></p>
<p class="p24">To <span class="t8">cry on</span>, was to <span class="t8">exclaim against</span>. I suppose, when unfair sportsmen destroyed more <span class="t8">quarry</span> or <span class="t8">game</span> than was reasonable, the censure was to cry, <span class="t8">Havock</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">(346) General Observation. If the dramas of Shakespeare were to be characterised, each by the particular excellence which distinguishes it from the rest, we must allow to the tragedy of Hamlet the praise of variety. The incidents are so numerous, that the argument of the play would make a long tale. The scenes are interchangeably diversified with merriment and solemnity; with merriment that includes judicious and instructive observations, and solemnity, not strained by poetical violence above the natural sentiments of man. New characters appear from time to time in continual succession, exhibiting various forms of life and particular modes of conversation. The pretended madness of Hamlet causes much mirth, the mournful distraction of Ophelia fills the heart with tenderness, and every personage produces the effect intended, from the apparition that in the first act chills the blood with horror, to the fop in the last, that exposes affectation to just contempt. The conduct is perhaps not wholly secure against objections. The action is indeed for the most part in continual progression, but there are some scenes which neither forward nor retard it. Of the feigned madness of Hamlet there appears no adequate cause, for he does nothing which he might not have done with the reputation of sanity. He plays the madman most, when he treats Ophelia with so much rudeness, which seems to be useless and wanton cruelty.</p>
<p class="p24">Hamlet is, through the whole play, rather an instrument than an agent. After he has, by the stratagem of the play, convicted the king, he makes no attempt to punish him, and his death is at last effected by an incident which Hamlet had no part in producing.</p>
<p class="p24">The catastrophe is not very happily produced; the exchange of weapons is rather an expedient of necessity, than a stroke of art. A scheme might easily have been formed to kill Hamlet with the dagger, and Laertes with the bowl.</p>
<p class="p24">The poet is accused of having shewn little regard to poetical justice, and may be charged with equal neglect of poetical probability. The apparition left the regions of the dead to little purpose; the revenge which he demands is not obtained, but by the death of him that was required to take it; and the gratification which would arise from the destruction of an usurper and a murderer, is abated by the untimely death of Ophelia, the young, the beautiful, the harmless, and the pious.</p>
