h &mdash; n in a godly fit<br/>The tale relate, in aid of Holy Writ;<br/>Though candid Adams, by whom David fell,36<br/>Who ancient miracles sustain&rsquo;d so well,<br/>To recent wonders may deny his aid,37<br/>Nor own a buzy zealot of the trade.<br/>A coward wish, long stigmatiz&rsquo;d by fame,<br/>Devotes Mæcenas to eternal shame;38<br/>Religious Johnson, future life to gain,<br/>Would ev&rsquo;n submit to everlasting pain:<br/>How clear, how strong, such kindred colours paint<br/>The Roman epicure and Christian saint!<br/>O, had he liv&rsquo;d in more enlighten&rsquo;d times,<br/>When signs from heaven proclaim&rsquo;d vile mortals&rsquo; crimes,<br/>How had he groan&rsquo;d, with sacred horrors pale,<br/>When Noah&rsquo;s comet shook her angry tail;39<br/>That wicked comet, which Will Whiston swore<br/>Would burn the earth that she had drown&rsquo;d before!40<br/>Or when Moll Tosts, by throes parturient vext,<br/>Saw her young rabbets peep from Esdras&rsquo; text!41<br/>To him such signs, prepar&rsquo;d by mystick grace,<br/>Had shewn the impending doom of Adam&rsquo;s race.<br/>But who to blaze his frailties feels delight,<br/>When the great author rises to our sight?<br/>When the pure tenour of his life we view,<br/>Himself the bright exemplar that he drew?<br/>Whose works console the good, instruct the wise,<br/>And teach the soul to claim her kindred skies.<br/>By grateful bards his name be ever sung,<br/>Whose sterling touch has fix&rsquo;d the English tongue!<br/>Fortune&rsquo;s dire weight, the patron&rsquo;s cold disdain,<br/>&ldquo;Shook off, as dew-drops from the lion&rsquo;s mane;&rdquo;42<br/>Unknown, unaided, in a friendless state,43<br/>Without one smile of favour from the great;<br/>The bulky tome his curious care refines,<br/>Till the great work in full perfection shines;<br/>His wide research and patient skill displays<br/>What scarce was sketch&rsquo;d in Anna&rsquo;s golden days;44<br/>What only learning&rsquo;s aggregated toil<br/>Slowly accomplish&rsquo;d in each foreign soil.45<br/>Yet to the mine though the rich coin he trace,<br/>No current marks his early essays grace;<br/>For in each page we find a massy store<br/>Of English bullion mix&rsquo;d with Latian ore:<br/>In solemn pomp, with pedantry combin&rsquo;d,<br/>He vents the morbid sadness of his mind;46<br/>In scientifick phrase affects to smile,<br/>Form&rsquo;d on Brown&rsquo;s turgid Latin-English style:47<br/>Too oft the abstract decorates his prose,48<br/>While measur&rsquo;d ternaries the periods close:<br/>But all propriety his Ramblers mock,<br/>When Betty prates from Newton and from Locke;<br/>When no diversity we trace between<br/>The lofty moralist and gay fifteen &mdash; 49<br/>Yet genius still breaks through the encumbering phrase;<br/>His taste we censure, but the work we praise:<br/>There learning beams with fancy&rsquo;s brilliant dyes,<br/>Vivid as lights that gild the northern skies;<br/>Man&rsquo;s complex heart he bares to open day,<br/>Clear as the prism unfolds the blended ray:<br/>The picture from his mind assumes its hue;<br/>The shades too dark, but the design still true.<br/>Though Johnson&rsquo;s merits thus I freely scan,<br/>And paint the foibles of this wond&rsquo;rous man;<br/>Yet can I coolly read, and not admire,<br/>When Learning, Wit and Poetry conspire<br/>To shed a radiance o&rsquo;er his moral page,<br/>And spread truth&rsquo;s sacred light to many an age?<br/>For all his works with innate lustre shine,<br/>Strength all his own, and energy divine.<br/>While through life&rsquo;s maze he sent a piercing view,<br/>His mind expansive to the object grew.<br/>With various stores of erudition fraught,<br/>The lively image, the deep-searching thought,<br/>Slept in repose; &mdash; but when the moment press&rsquo;d,<br/>The bright ideas flood at once confess&rsquo;d;50<br/>Instant his genius sped its vigorous rays,<br/>And o&rsquo;er the letter&rsquo;d world diffus&rsquo;d a blaze:<br/>As womb&rsquo;d with fire the cloud electrick flies,<br/>And calmly o&rsquo;er the horizon seems to rise;<br/>Touch&rsquo;d by the pointed steel, the lightning flows,<br/>And all the expanse with rich effulgence glows.<br/>In judgment keen, he acts the critick&rsquo;s part,<br/>By reason proves the feelings of the heart;<br/>In thought profound, in nature&rsquo;s study wise,<br/>Shews from what source our fine sensations rise;<br/>With truth, precision, fancy&rsquo;s claims defines,<br/>And throws new splendour o&rsquo;er the poet&rsquo;s lines.51<br/>When specious sophists with presumption scan<br/>The source of evil, hidden still from man;52<br/>Revive Arabian tales53, and vainly hope<br/>To rival St. John, and his scholar, Pope;54<br/>Though metaphysicks spread the gloom of night,<br/>By reason&rsquo;s star he guides our aching sight;<br/>The bounds of knowledge marks; and points the way<br/>To pathless wastes, where wilder&rsquo;d sages stray;<br/>Where, like a farthing linkboy, Jennings stands,<br/>And the dim torch drops from his feeble hands.<br/>Impressive truth, in splendid fiction drest,55<br/>Checks the vain wish, and calms the troubled breast;<br/>O&rsquo;er the dark mind a light celestial throws,<br/>And sooths the angry passions to repose;<br/>As oil effus&rsquo;d illumes and smooths the deep,56<br/>When round the bark the foaming surges sweep. &mdash; <br/>But hark, he sings! the strain ev&rsquo;n Pope admires;<br/>Indignant Virtue her own bard inspires;<br/>Sublime as Juvenal, he pours his lays,57<br/>And with the Roman shares congenial praise: &mdash; <br/>In glowing numbers now he fires the age,<br/>And Shakspeare&rsquo;s sun relumes the clouded stage.58<br/>So full his mind with images was fraught,<br/>The rapid strains scarce claim&rsquo;d a second thought;<br/>And with like ease his vivid lines assume<br/>The garb and dignity of ancient Rome. &mdash; <br/>Let college <span class="t8">versemen</span> trite conceits express,<br/>Trick&rsquo;d out in splendid shreds of Virgil&rsquo;s dress;<br/>From playful Ovid cull the tinsel phrase,<br/>And vapid notions hitch in pilfer&rsquo;d lays;<br/>Then with mosaick art the piece combine,<br/>And boast the glitter of each dulcet line:<br/>Johnson adventur&rsquo;d boldly to transfuse<br/>His vigorous sense into the Latian muse;<br/>Aspir&rsquo;d to shine by unreflected light,<br/>And with a Roman&rsquo;s ardour <span class="t8">think</span><a id="a2560"></a><a id="a2561"></a> and write.<br/>He felt the tuneful Nine his breast inspire,<br/>And, like a master, wak&rsquo;d the59 soothing lyre:<br/>Horatian strains a grateful heart proclaim,<br/>While Sky&rsquo;s wild rocks resound his Thralia&rsquo;s name. &mdash; <br/>Hesperia&rsquo;s plant, in some less skillful hands,<br/>To bloom a while, factitious heat demands;<br/>Though glowing Maro a faint warmth supplies,<br/>The sickly blossom in the hot-house dies:<br/>By Johnson&rsquo;s genial culture, art, and toil,<br/>Its root strikes deep, and owns the fost&rsquo;ring soil;<br/>Imbibes our sun through all its swelling veins,<br/>And grows a native of Britannia&rsquo;s plains.<br/>Soft-ey&rsquo;d compassion, with a look benign<br/>His fervent vows he offer&rsquo;d at thy shrine;<br/>To guilt, to woe, the sacred debt was paid,60<br/>And helpless females bless&rsquo;d his pious aid:<br/>Snatch&rsquo;d from disease, and want&rsquo;s abandon&rsquo;d crew,<br/>Despair and anguish from their victims flew;<br/>Hope&rsquo;s soothing balm into their bosoms stole,<br/>And tears of penitence restor&rsquo;d the soul.<br/>Nor did philanthrophy alone expand<br/>His liberal heart, and ope his bounteous hand;<br/>His <span class="t8">talents</span><a id="a2562"></a><a id="a2563"></a> ev&rsquo;n he gave to friendship&rsquo;s claim,61<br/>And by the gift imparted wealth and fame:<br/>His mind exhaustless sped its vivid force,<br/>Yet with unbated vigour held its course;<br/>As some fix&rsquo;d star fulfills heaven&rsquo;s great designs,<br/>Lights other spheres, yet undiminish&rsquo;d shines.<br/>How few distinguish&rsquo;d of the studious train<br/>At the gay board their empire can maintain!<br/>In their own books intomb&rsquo;d their wisdom lies;<br/>Too dull for talk, their slow conceptions rise:<br/>Yet the mute author, of his writings proud,<br/>For wit unshewn claims homage from the crowd;<br/>As thread-bare misers, by mean avarice school&rsquo;d,<br/>Expect obeisance from their hidden gold. &mdash; <br/>In converse quick, impetuous Johnson press&rsquo;d<br/>His weighty logick, or sarcastick jest:<br/>Strong in the chace, and nimble in the turns,62<br/>For victory still his fervid spirit burns;<br/>Subtle when wrong, invincible when right,<br/>Arm&rsquo;d at all points, and glorying in his might,<br/>Gladiator-like, he traverses the field,<br/>And strength and skill compel the foe to yield. &mdash; <br/>Yet have I seen him, with a milder air,<br/>Encircled by the witty and the fair,<br/>Ev&rsquo;n in old age with placid mien rejoice<br/>At beauty&rsquo;s smile, and beauty&rsquo;s flattering voice. &mdash; <br/>With Reynolds&rsquo; pencil, vivid, bold, and true,<br/>So fervent Boswell gives him to our view.<br/>In every trait we see his mind expand;<br/>The master rises by the pupil&rsquo;s hand;<br/>We love the writer, praise his happy vein,<br/>Grac&rsquo;d with the naiveté of the sage Montaigne.<br/>Hence not alone are brighter parts display&rsquo;d,<br/>But ev&rsquo;n the specks of character portray&rsquo;d:<br/>We <span class="t8">see</span><a id="a2564"></a><a id="a2565"></a><a id="a2566"></a><a id="a2567"></a><a id="a2568"></a><a id="a2569"></a><a id="a2570"></a><a id="a2571"></a><a id="a2572"></a><a id="a2573"></a> the Rambler with fastidious smile<br/>Mark the lone tree, and note the heath-clad isle;<br/>But when the heroick tale of Flora charms,63<br/>Deck&rsquo;d in a kilt, he wields a chieftain&rsquo;s arms:<br/>The tuneful piper sounds a martial strain,<br/>And Samuel sings, &ldquo;The King shall have his ain&rdquo;:<br/>Two Georges in his loyal zeal are slur&rsquo;d,64<br/>A gracious pension only saves the third! &mdash; <br/>By Nature&rsquo;s gifts ordain&rsquo;d mankind to rule,<br/>He, like a Titian, form&rsquo;d his brilliant school;<br/>And taught congenial spirits to excel,<br/>While from his lips impressive wisdom fell.<br/>Our boasted Goldsmith felt the sovereign sway;<br/>From him deriv&rsquo;d the sweet yet nervous lay.<br/>To Fame&rsquo;s proud cliff he bade our Raphael rise;<br/>Hence Reynolds&rsquo; pen with Reynolds&rsquo; pencil vyes.<br/>With Johnson&rsquo;s flame melodious Burney glows,65<br/>While the grand strain in smoother cadence flows.<br/>And you, Malone, to critick learning dear,<br/>Correct and elegant, refin&rsquo;d, though clear,<br/>By studying him, acquir&rsquo;d that classick taste,<br/>Which high in Shakspeare&rsquo;s fane thy statue plac&rsquo;d.<br/>Near Johnson Steevens stands, on scenick ground,<br/>Acute, laborious, fertile, and profound.<br/>Ingenious Hawkesworth to this school we owe,<br/>And scarce the pupil from the tutor know.<br/>Here early parts accomplish&rsquo;d Jones66 sublimes,<br/>And science blends with Asia&rsquo;s lofty rhimes:<br/>Harmonious Jones! who in his splendid strains<br/>Sings Camdeo&rsquo;s sports, on Agra&rsquo;s flowery plains;<br/>In Hindu fictions while we fondly trace<br/>Love and the Muses, deck&rsquo;d with Attick grace.67<br/>Amid these names can Boswell be forgot,<br/>Scarce by North Britons now esteem&rsquo;d a Scot?68<br/>Who to the sage devoted from his youth,<br/>Imbib&rsquo;d from him the sacred love of truth;<br/>The keen research, the exercise of mind,<br/>And that best art, the art to know mankind. &mdash; <br/>Nor was his energy confin&rsquo;d alone<br/>To friends around his philosophick throne;<br/>Its influence wide improv&rsquo;d our letter&rsquo;d isle,<br/>And lucid vigour mark&rsquo;d the general style:<br/>As Nile&rsquo;s proud waves, swol&rsquo;n from their oozy bed,<br/>First o&rsquo;er the neighbouring meads majestick spread;<br/>Till gathering force, they more and more expand,<br/>And with new virtue fertilise the land.<br/>Thus sings the Muse, to Johnson&rsquo;s memory just,<br/>And scatters praise and censure o&rsquo;er his dust;<br/>For through each checker&rsquo;d scene a contrast ran,<br/>Too sad a proof, how great, how weak is man!<br/>Though o&rsquo;er his passions conscience held the rein,<br/>He shook at dismal phantoms of the brain:<br/>A boundless faith that noble mind debas&rsquo;d,<br/>By piercing wit, energick reason grac&rsquo;d:<br/>A generous Briton69, yet he seems to hope<br/>For James&rsquo;s grandson, and for James&rsquo;s Pope:<br/>With courtly zeal fair freedom&rsquo;s sons defames,70<br/>Yet, like a Hamden, pleads Ierne&rsquo;s claims.71<br/>Though proudly splenetick, yet idly vain,<br/>Accepted flattery, and dealt disdain. &mdash; <br/>E&rsquo;en shades like these, to brilliancy ally&rsquo;d,<br/>May comfort fools, and curb the Sage&rsquo;s pride.<br/>Yet Learning&rsquo;s sons, who o&rsquo;er his foibles mourn,<br/>To latest time shall fondly view his urn;<br/>And wond&rsquo;ring praise, to human frailties blind,<br/>Talents and virtue of the brightest kind;<br/>Revere the man, with various knowledge stor&rsquo;d,<br/>Who science, arts, and life&rsquo;s whole scheme explor&rsquo;d;<br/>Who firmly scorn&rsquo;d, when in a lowly state,<br/>To flatter vice, or court the vain and great;72<br/>Whose heart still felt a sympathetick glow,<br/>Prompt to relieve man&rsquo;s variegated woe;<br/>Whose ardent hope, intensely fix&rsquo;d on high,<br/>Saw future bliss with intellectual eye.<br/>Still in his breast Religion held her sway,<br/>Disclosing visions of celestial day;<br/>And gave his soul, amidst this world of strife,<br/>The blest reversion of eternal life:<br/>By this dispell&rsquo;d, each doubt and horrour flies,<br/>And calm at length in holy peace he dies.<br/>The sculptur&rsquo;d trophy, and imperial bust,<br/>That proudly rise around his hallow&rsquo;d dust,<br/>Shall mould&rsquo;ring fall, by Time&rsquo;s slow hand decay&rsquo;d,<br/>But the bright meed of virtue ne&rsquo;er shall fade.<br/>Exulting Genius stamps his sacred name,<br/>Enroll&rsquo;d for ever in the dome of Fame.</p>
