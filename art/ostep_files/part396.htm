RAIDs are designed to detect and recover from certain kinds of disk faults; thus, knowing exactly which faults to expect is critical in arriving upon a working design.</p><p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">The first fault model we will assume is quite simple, and has been called the <b>fail-stop </b>fault model [S84]. In this model, a disk can be in exactly one of two states: working or failed. With a working disk, all blocks can be read or written. In contrast, when a disk has failed, we assume it is permanently lost.</p><p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">One critical aspect of the fail-stop model is what it assumes about fault detection. Specifically, when a disk has failed, we assume that this is easily detected. For example, in a RAID array, we would assume that the RAID controller hardware (or software) can immediately observe when a disk has failed.</p><p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Thus, for now, we do not have to worry about more complex “silent” failures such as disk corruption. We also do not have to worry about a sin- gle block becoming inaccessible upon an otherwise working disk (some- times called a latent sector error). We will consider these more complex (and unfortunately, more realistic) disk faults later.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part395.htm">&lt; 上一个</a><span> | </span><a href="../ostep.html">内容</a><span> | </span><a href="part397.htm">下一个 &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
