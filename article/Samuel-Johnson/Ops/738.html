<h2 class="h20"><a id="a1807"></a><a id="a1806"></a>CORIOLANUS</h2>
<p class="p21">1.i.19 (292,1) but they think, we are too dear] They think that the charge of maintaining us is more than we are worth.</p>
<p class="p24">I.i.23 (292,3) ere we become rakes] It is plain that, in our authour&rsquo;s time, we had the proverb, <span class="t8">as lean as a rake</span>. Of this proverb the original is obscure. <span class="t8">Rake</span> now signifies a <span class="t8">dissolute man</span>, a man worn out with disease and debauchery. But the signification is, I think, much more modern than the proverb. <span class="t8">Raekel</span>, in Islandick, is said to mean a <span class="t8">cur-dog</span>, and this was probably the first use among us of the word <span class="t8">rake</span>; <span class="t8">as lean as a rake</span> is, therefore, as lean as it dog too worthless to be fed.</p>
<p class="p24">1.i.94 (294,4) I will venture/To scale&rsquo;t a little more] [Warburton had taken Theobald to task for emending to &ldquo;stale&rsquo;t&rdquo;, offering two quotations to prove that &ldquo;scale&rdquo; meant &ldquo;apply.&rdquo;] Neither of Dr. Warburton&rsquo;s examples afford a sense congruous to the present occasion. In the passage quoted, to <span class="t8">scale</span> may be to <span class="t8">weigh</span> and <span class="t8">compare</span>, but where do we find that <span class="t8">scale</span> is to <span class="t8">apply</span>? If we <span class="t8">scale</span> the two criticks, I think Theobald has the advantage.</p>
<p class="p24">I.i.97 (295,5) fob off our disgraces with a tale] <span class="t8">Disgraces</span> are <span class="t8">hardships, injuries</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">I.i.104 (295,6) where the other instruments] <span class="t8">Where</span> for <span class="t8">whereas</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">I.i.112 (296,7) Which ne&rsquo;er came from the lungs] with a smile not indicating pleasure, but contempt.</p>
<p class="p24">I.i.120 (296,9) The counsellor heart] The heart was anciently esteemed the seat of prudence. <span class="t8">Homo cordatum</span> is a <span class="t8">prudent man</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">I.i.163 (297,1) Thou rascal, that art worst in blood, to ruin,/ Lead&rsquo;st first, to win some &lsquo;vantage] I think, we may better read, by an easy change, <span class="t8">Thou rascal that art worst, in blood, to</span> ruin [to run] <span class="t8">Lead&rsquo;st first, to win</span>, &amp;c.</p>
<p class="p24">Thou that art the meanest by birth, art the foremost to lead thy fellows <span class="t8">to ruin</span>, in hope of some advantage. The meaning, however, is perhaps only this, Thou that art a hound, or running dog of the lowest breed, lead&rsquo;st the pack, when any thing is to be gotten. (see 1765, VI, 493, 1)</p>
<p class="p24">I.i.172 (298,4) What would you have, ye curs,/ That like not peace, nor war? The one affrights you,/ The other makes you proud] [W: likes] That <span class="t8">to like</span> is <span class="t8">to please</span>, every one knows, but in that sense it is as hard to say why peace should not <span class="t8">like</span> the people, as, in the other sense, why the people should not <span class="t8">like</span> peace. The truth is, that Coriolanus does not use the two sentences consequentially, but reproaches them with unsteadiness, then with their other occasional vices.</p>
<p class="p24">I.i.202 (300,6) I&rsquo;d make a quarry/With thousands] Why a quarry? I suppose, not because he would pile them square, but because he would give them for carrion to the birds of prey.</p>
<p class="p24">I.i.215 (300,7) To break the heart of generosity] To give the final blow to the <span class="t8">nobles</span>. <span class="t8">Generosity</span> is <span class="t8">high birth</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">I.i.231 (301,8) &rsquo;tis true, that yon have lately told us./The Volscians are in arms] Coriolanus had been but just told himself that <span class="t8">the Volscians were in arms</span>. The meaning is, <span class="t8">The intelligence which you gave us some little time ago of the designs of the Volscians is now verified; they are in arms.</span></p>
<p class="p24">I.i.255 (302,8) Your valour puts well forth] That is, You have in this mutiny shewn fair blossoms of valour.</p>
<p class="p24">I.i.260 (303,9) to gird. To <span class="t8">sneer</span>, to <span class="t8">gibe</span>. So Falstaff uses the noun, when he says, <span class="t8">every man has a</span> gird <span class="t8">at me</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">I.i.281 (304,3) in what fashion,/More than his singularity he goes/ Upon this present action] We will learn what he is to do, besides <span class="t8">going himself</span>; what are his powers, and what is his appointment.</p>
<p class="p24">I.ii.28 (305,4) for the remove/Bring up your army] [W:&rsquo;fore they] I do not see the nonsense or impropriety of the old reading. Says the senator to Aufidius, <span class="t8">Go to your troops, we will garrison Corioli</span>. If the Romans besiege us, bring up your army <span class="t8">to remove them</span>. If any change should be made, I would read,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&mdash; <span class="t8">for</span> their <span class="t8">remove</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">I.iii.16 (307,5) brows bound with oak] The crown given by the Romans to him that saved the life of a citizen, which was accounted more honourable than any other.</p>
<p class="p24">I.iv.14 (311,9) nor a man that fears you less than he,/That&rsquo;s lesser than a little] The sense requires it to be read,</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">nor a man that fears you</span> more <span class="t8">than he</span>,</p>
<p class="p24">Or more probably,</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">nor a man</span> but <span class="t8">fears you less than he,</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">That&rsquo;s lesser than a little</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">I.v.5 (314,4) prize their hours] In the first edition it is, <span class="t8">prize their</span> hours. I know not who corrected it [to <span class="t8">prize their honours</span>]. A modern editor, who had made such an improvement, would have spent half a page in ostentation of his sagacity.</p>
<p class="p24">I.vi.36 (317,6) Ransoming him, or pitying] i.e. <span class="t8">remitting his ransom</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">I.vi.61 (318,8) swords advanc&rsquo;d] That is, swords lifted high.</p>
<p class="p24">I.vi.83 (319,9) Please you to march,/And four shall quickly draw out my command,/Which men are best inclin&rsquo;d] I cannot but suspect this passage of corruption. Why should they <span class="t8">march</span>, that <span class="t8">four</span> might select those that were <span class="t8">best inclin&rsquo;d</span>? How would their inclinations be known? Who were the <span class="t8">four</span> that should select them? Perhaps, we may read,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&mdash; <span class="t8">Please you to march,</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">And</span> fear <span class="t8">shall quickly draw out</span> of <span class="t8">my command,</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Which men are</span> least <span class="t8">inclin&rsquo;d</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">It is easy to conceive that, by a little negligence, <span class="t8">fear</span> might be changed to <span class="t8">four</span>, and <span class="t8">least</span> to <span class="t8">best</span>. Let us march, and that fear which incites desertion will free my army from cowards. (see 1765, VI, 512, 1)</p>
<p class="p24">I.viii.11 (320,1) Wert thou the Hector,/That was the whip of your bragg&rsquo;d progeny] The Romans boasted themselves descended from the Trojans, how then was Hector the <span class="t8">whip of their progeny</span>? It must mean the whip with which the Trojans scourged the Greeks, which cannot be but by a very unusual construction, or the authour must have forgotten the original of the Romans; unless <span class="t8">whip</span> has some meaning which includes <span class="t8">advantage</span> or <span class="t8">superiority</span>, as we say, <span class="t8">he has the</span> whip-hand, for <span class="t8">he has the</span> advantage.</p>
<p class="p24">I.viii.14 (321,2) you have sham&rsquo;d me/In your condemned seconds] For <span class="t8">condemned</span>, we may read <span class="t8">contemned</span>. You have, to my shane, sent me help <span class="t8">which I despise</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">I.ix.12 (321,4) Here is the steed, we the caparisons!] This is an odd encomium. The meaning is, <span class="t8">this man performed the action, and we only filled up the show</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">I.ii.14 (322,5) a charter to extol] A privilege to praise her own son.</p>
<p class="p24">I.ix.29 (322,6) Should they not] That is, <span class="t8">not be remembered</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">I.ix.72 (325,9) To the fairness of any power] [<span class="t8">Fairness</span>, for <span class="t8">utmost</span>. WARE.] I know not how <span class="t8">fairness</span> can mean <span class="t8">utmost</span>. When two engage on <span class="t8">equal</span> terms, we say it is <span class="t8">fair</span>; <span class="t8">fairness</span> may therefore be <span class="t8">equality; in proportion equal to my power</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">I.ix.76 (325,1) The best] The <span class="t8">chief</span> men of Corioli.</p>
<p class="p24">I.x.5 (326,3) Being a Volsce, be that I am] It may be just observed, that Shakespeare calls the <span class="t8">Volsci, Volsces</span>, which the modern editors have changed to the modern termination [Volscian]. I mention it here, because here the change has spoiled the measure. <span class="t8">Being a</span> Volsce, <span class="t8">be that I am. Condition</span>. [Steevans restored <span class="t8">Volsce</span> in the text.]</p>
<p class="p24">I.x.17 (326,2) My valour&rsquo;s poison&rsquo;d,/With only suffering stain by him, for him/ Shall flie out of itself] To mischief him, my valour should <span class="t8">deviate from</span> its own native generosity.</p>
<p class="p24">I.x.25 (327,4) At home, upon my brother&rsquo;s guard] In my own house, with my brother posted to protect him.</p>
<p class="p24">II.i.8 (328,5) Pray you, who does the wolf love?] When the tribune, in reply to Menenius&rsquo;s remark, on the people&rsquo;s hate of Coriolanus, had observed that even <span class="t8">beasts know their friends</span>, Menenius asks, <span class="t8">whom does the wolf love</span>? implying that there are beasts which love nobody, and that among those beasts are the people.</p>
<p class="p24">II.i.43 (329,6) towards the napes of your necks] With allusion to the fable, which says, that every man has a bag hanging before him, in which he puts his neighbour&rsquo;s faults, and another behind him, in which he stows his own.</p>
<p class="p24">II.i.56 (330,7) one that converses more with the buttock of the night, than with the forehead of the morning] Rather a late lier down than an early riser.</p>
<p class="p24">II.i.84 (330,1) set up the bloody flag against all patience] That is, declare war against patience. There is not wit enough in this satire to recompense its grossness.</p>
<p class="p24">II.i.105 (331,2) herdsmen of beastly Plebeians] As kings are called [Greek: poimenes laon].</p>
<p class="p24">II.i.115 (331,3) Take my cap, Jupiter, and I thank thee] [W: cup] Shakespeare so often mentions throwing up caps in this play, that Menenius may be well enough supposed to throw up his cap in thanks to Jupiter.</p>
<p class="p24">II.i.146 (333,4) possest of this?] <span class="t8">Possest</span>, in our authour&rsquo;s language, is fully informed.</p>
<p class="p24">II.i.178 (334,6) Which being advanc&rsquo;d, declines] Volumnia, in her boasting strain, says, that her son to kill his enemy, has nothing to do but to lift his hand up and let it fall.</p>
<p class="p24">II.i.232 (337,3) Commit the war of white and damask, in/Their nicely gawded cheeks] [W: wars] Has the commentator never heard of roses <span class="t8">contending</span> with lilies for the empire of a lady&rsquo;s cheek? The <span class="t8">opposition</span> of colours, though not the <span class="t8">commixture</span>, may be called a war.</p>
<p class="p24">II.i.235 (338,1) As if that whatsoever God] That is, <span class="t8">as if that God who leads him, whatsoever</span> God he be.</p>
<p class="p24">II.i.241 (338,2) From where he should begin, and end] Perhaps it should be read,</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">From where he should begin</span> t&rsquo;an <span class="t8">end</span>. &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">II.i.247 (338,3) As he is proud to do&rsquo;t] [I should rather think the author wrote <span class="t8">prone</span>: because the common reading is scarce sense or English. WARBURTON.] <span class="t8">Proud to do</span>, is the same as, <span class="t8">proud of doing</span>, very plain sense, and very common English.</p>
<p class="p24">II.i.285 (340,4) carry with us ears and eyes] That is, let us observe what passes, but keep our hearts fixed on our design of crushing Coriolanus.</p>
<p class="p24">II.ii.19 (340,5) he wav&rsquo;d indifferently] That is, <span class="t8">he would wave indifferently</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">II.ii.29 (341,6) supple and courteous to the people; bonnetted] The sense, I think, requires that we should read, <span class="t8">unbonnetted</span>. Who have risen only by <span class="t8">pulling off their hats</span> to the people. <span class="t8">Bonnetted</span> may relate to <span class="t8">people</span>, but not without harshness.</p>
<p class="p24">II.ii.57 (342,7) Your loving motion toward the common body] Your kind interposition with the common people.</p>
<p class="p24">II.ii.64 (342,9) That&rsquo;s off, that&rsquo;s off] That is, that is nothing to the purpose.</p>
<p class="p24">II.ii.82 (343,1) how can he flatter] The reasoning of Menenius is this: How can he be expected to practice flattery to others, who abhors it so much, that he cannot bear it even when offered to himself.</p>
<p class="p24">II.ii.92 (343,2) When Tarquin made a head for Rome] When Tarquin, who had been expelled, <span class="t8">raised a power</span> to recover Rome.</p>
<p class="p24">II.ii.113 (344,6) every motion/Was tim&rsquo;d with dying cries] The cries of the slaughter&rsquo;d regularly followed his motions, as musick and a dancer accompany each ether.</p>
<p class="p24">II.ii.115 (345,7) The mortal gate] The gate that was made the scene of death.</p>
<p class="p24">II.ii.127 (345,8) He cannot but with measure fit the honours] That is, no honour will be too great far him; he will show a mind equal to any elevation.</p>
<p class="p24">II.ii.131 (345,1)</p>
<p class="p24">rewards</p>
<p class="p24">His deeds with doing them; and is content</p>
<p class="p24">To spend his time, to end it]</p>
<p class="p24">I know not whether my conceit will be approved, but I cannot forbear to think that our author wrote thus.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&mdash; he <span class="t8">rewards</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">His deeds with doing them, and is content</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">To spend his time, to spend it.</span></p>
<p class="p24">To do great acts, for the sake of doing them; to spend his life, for the sake of spending it.</p>
<p class="p24">II.iii.4 (348,2) We have power in ourselves to do it, but it is a power that we have no power to do] [Warburton saw this as &ldquo;a ridicule on the Augustine manner of defining <span class="t8">free-will</span>.&rdquo;] A ridicule may be intended, but the sense is clear enough. <span class="t8">Power</span> first signifies <span class="t8">natural power</span> or <span class="t8">force</span>, and then <span class="t8">moral power</span> or <span class="t8">right</span>. Davies has used the same word with great variety of meaning.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Use all thy</span> powers <span class="t8">that heavenly</span> power <span class="t8">to praise,</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">That gave thee</span> power <span class="t8">to do</span>. &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">II.iii.18 (348,3) many-headed multitude] Hanmer reads, <span class="t8">many-headed</span> monster, but without necessity. To be <span class="t8">many-headed</span> includes <span class="t8">monstrousness</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">II.iii.115 (352,7) I will not seal your knowledge] I will not strengthen or compleat your knowledge. The seal is that which gives authenticity to a writing.</p>
<p class="p24">II.iii.122 (352,8)</p>
<p class="p24">Why in this woolvish tongue should I stand here</p>
<p class="p24">To beg of Bob and Dick, that do appear,</p>
<p class="p24">Their needless vouches?]</p>
<p class="p24">Why stand I here in this ragged apparel to beg of Bob and Dick, and such others as <span class="t8">make their appearance</span> here, their <span class="t8">unnecessary votes</span>. I rather think we should read [instead of <span class="t8">voucher</span>], <span class="t8">Their needless</span> vouches. But <span class="t8">voucher</span> may serve, as it may perhaps signify either the act or the agent.</p>
<p class="p24">II.iii.122 (352) this woolvish gown] Signifies this <span class="t8">rough hirsute</span> gown.</p>
<p class="p24">II.iii.182 (355,1) ignorant to see&rsquo;t?] [W: &ldquo;ignorant&rdquo; means &ldquo;impotent&rdquo;] That <span class="t8">ignorant</span> at any time has, otherwise than consequentially, the same meaning with <span class="t8">impotent</span>, I do not know. It has no such meaning in this place. <span class="t8">Were you</span> ignorant <span class="t8">to see it</span>, is, did you want knowledge to discern it.</p>
<p class="p24">II.iii.208 (356,2) free contempt] That is, with contempt open and unrestrained.</p>
<p class="p24">II.iii.227 (357,4) Enforce his pride] Object his pride, and enforce the objection.</p>
<p class="p24">II.iii.258 (358,7) Scaling his present bearing with his past] That is, <span class="t8">weighing</span> his past and present behaviour.</p>
<p class="p24">II.iii.267 (359,8) observe and answer/The vantage of his anger] Mark, catch, and improve the opportunity, which his hasty anger will afford us.</p>
<p class="p24">III.i.23 (360,9) prank them in authority] <span class="t8">Plume, deck, dignify</span> themselves.</p>
<p class="p24">III.i.58 (362,3) This paltring/Becomes not Rome] That is, this trick of dissimulation, this shuffling.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Let these be no more believ&rsquo;d</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">That</span> palter <span class="t8">with us in a double sense</span>. Macbeth.</p>
<p class="p24">III.i.60 (362,4) laid falsly] <span class="t8">Falsly</span> for <span class="t8">treacherously</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">III.i.66 (362,5) Let them regard me, as I do not flatter, and/ Therein behold themselves] Let them look in the mirror which I hold up to them, a mirror which does not flatter, and see themselves.</p>
<p class="p24">III.i.89 (363,6) minnows] a <span class="t8">minnow</span> is one of the smallest river fish, called in some counties a <span class="t8">pink</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">III.i.90 (364,6) &rsquo;Twas from the canon] Was contrary to the established role; it was a form of speech to which he has no right.</p>
<p class="p24">III.i.98 (364,9) Then vail your ignorance] [W: &ldquo;ignorance&rdquo; means &ldquo;impotence.&rdquo;] Hanmer&rsquo;s transposition deserves notice</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&mdash; <span class="t8">If they have power,</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Let them have cushions by you; if none, awake</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Your dang&rsquo;rous lenity; if you are learned,</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Be not as commmon fools; if you are not,</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Then vail your ignorance. You are Plebeians</span>, &amp;c.</p>
<p class="p24">I neither think the transposition of one editor right, nor the interpretation of the other. The sense is plain enough without supposing <span class="t8">ignorance</span> to have any remote or consequential sense. <span class="t8">If this man has power, let the</span> ignorance <span class="t8">that gave it him</span> vail <span class="t8">or bow down before him.</span></p>
<p class="p24">III.i.101 (365,1) You are Plebeians,</p>
<p class="p24">If they be Senators: and they are no less,</p>
<p class="p24">When, both your voices blended, the greatest taste</p>
<p class="p24">Most palates theirs]</p>
<p class="p24">These lines may, I think, be made more intelligible by a very slight correction.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&mdash; <span class="t8">they no less [than senators]</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">When, both your voices blended, the great&rsquo;st taste</span></p>
<p class="p24">Must palate <span class="t8">theirs.</span></p>
<p class="p24">When the <span class="t8">taste</span> of the <span class="t8">great</span>, the patricians, must <span class="t8">palate</span>, must <span class="t8">please</span> [or must <span class="t8">try</span>] that of the plebeians.</p>
<p class="p24">III.i.124 (366,3) They would not thread the gates] That is, <span class="t8">pass</span> them. We yet say, to <span class="t8">thread</span> an alley.</p>
<p class="p24">III.i.129 (366,4) could never be the native] [<span class="t8">Native</span> for natural birth. WARBURTON.] <span class="t8">Native</span> is here not natural birth, but <span class="t8">natural parent</span>, or <span class="t8">cause of birth</span>. But I would read <span class="t8">motive</span>, which, without any distortion of its meaning, suits the speaker&rsquo;s purpose.</p>
<p class="p24">III.i.151 (367,7) That love the fundamental part of state/More than you doubt the change of&rsquo;t] To <span class="t8">doubt</span> is to <span class="t8">fear</span>. The meaning is, You whose zeal predominates over your terrours; you who do not so much fear the danger of violent measures, as wish the good to which they are necessary, the preservation of the original constitution of our government.</p>
<p class="p24">III.i.158 (368,2) Mangles true judgment] <span class="t8">Judgment</span> is <span class="t8">judgment</span> in its common sense, or the faculty by which right is distinguished from wrong.</p>
<p class="p24">III.i.159 (368,3) that integrity which should become it] <span class="t8">Integrity</span> is in this place <span class="t8">soundness</span>, uniformity, consistency, in the same sense as Dr. Warburton often uses it, when he mentions the <span class="t8">integrity</span> of a metaphor. To <span class="t8">become</span>, is to <span class="t8">suit</span>, to <span class="t8">befit</span>.</p>

<p class="p24">III.ii.64 (379,1) I am in this/Your wife, your son] I rather think the meaning is, <span class="t8">I am in their</span> condition, I am <span class="t8">at stake</span>, together with <span class="t8">your wife, your son</span>.</p>

The <span class="t8">hand</span> is <span class="t8">waved</span> to gain attention; the <span class="t8">head</span> is shaken in token of sorrow. The word <span class="t8">wave</span> suits better to the hand, but in considering the authour&rsquo;s language, too much stress must not be laid on propriety against the copies.

<p class="p24">It is remarkable, that, among the political maxims of the speculative Harrington, there is one which he might have borrowed from this speech. <span class="t8">The people</span>, says he, <span class="t8">cannot see, but they can feel</span>. It is not much to the honour of the people, that they have the same character of stupidity from their enemy and their friend. Such was the power of our authour&rsquo;s mind, that he looked through life in all its relations private and civil.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.i.7 (390,1) Fortune&rsquo;s blows,/When most struck home, being gentle wounded, craves/A noble cunning] This it the ancient and authentick reading. The modern editors have, for <span class="t8">gentle wounded</span>, silently substituted <span class="t8">gently warded</span>, and Dr. Warburton has explained <span class="t8">gently</span> by <span class="t8">nobly</span>. It is good to be sure of our authour&rsquo;s words before we go about to explain their meaning.</p>
<p class="p24">The sense is, When Fortune strikes her hardest blows, to be wounded, and yet continue calm, requires a generous policy. He calls this calmness <span class="t8">cunning</span>, because it is the effect of reflection and philosophy. Perhaps the first emotions of nature are nearly uniform, and one man differs from another in the power of endurance, as he is better regulated by precept and instruction.</p>

<p class="p24">Was not a man my father?]</p>
<p class="p24">The word <span class="t8">mankind</span> is used maliciously by the first speaker, and taken perversely by the second. A <span class="t8">mankind</span> woman is a woman with the roughness of a man, and, in an aggravated sense, a woman ferocious, violent, and eager to shed blood. In this sense Sicinius asks Volumnia, if she be <span class="t8">mankind</span>. She takes <span class="t8">mankind</span> for a <span class="t8">human creature</span>, and accordingly cries out,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&mdash; <span class="t8">Note but this, fool.</span></p>

<p class="p24"><span class="t8">My title is</span> affear&rsquo;d. Macbeth.</p>
<p class="p24">To <span class="t8">repeal</span> may be <span class="t8">to bring to remembrance</span>, but <span class="t8">appeal</span> has another meaning.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.iii.48 (397,8) already in the entertainment] That is, tho&rsquo; not actually encamped, yet already in <span class="t8">pay</span>. To <span class="t8">entertain</span> an army is to take them into pay.</p>

<p class="p24">This enemy&rsquo;s town: &mdash; I&rsquo;ll enter: if he slay me]</p>
<p class="p24">He who reads this [My country have I and my lovers left;/This enemy&rsquo;s town I&rsquo;ll enter] would think that he was reading the lines of Shakespeare: except that Coriolanus, being already in the town, says, he <span class="t8">will enter it</span>. Yet the old edition exhibits it thus</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&mdash; <span class="t8">So with me.</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">My birth-place have I; and my loves upon</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">This enemic towne; I&rsquo;ll enter if he slay me</span>, &amp;c.</p>
<p class="p24">The intermediate line seems to be lost, in which, conformably to his former observation, he says, that <span class="t8">he has</span> lost <span class="t8">his birth-place, and his loves upon</span> a petty dispute, and is trying his chance in <span class="t8">this enemy town</span>, he then cries, turning to the house of Anfidius, <span class="t8">I&rsquo;ll enter if he slay me</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">I have preferred the common reading, because it is, though faulty, yet intelligible, and the original passage, for want of copies, cannot be restored.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.v.76 (403,3) a good memory] The Oxford editor, not knowing that <span class="t8">memory</span> was used at that time for <span class="t8">memorial</span>, alters it to <span class="t8">memorial</span>.</p>

<p class="p24">IV.vi.2 (408,1) His remedies are tame i&rsquo; the present peace] The old reading is,</p>

<p class="p24"><span class="t8">And quietness o&rsquo; the people</span>, &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">The meaning, somewhat harshly expressed, according to our authour&rsquo;s custom, is this: <span class="t8">We need not fear him</span>, the proper <span class="t8">remedies</span> against him <span class="t8">are taken</span>, by restoring <span class="t8">peace and quietness</span>.</p>

<p class="p24">IV.vi.124 (414,8) They&rsquo;ll roar him in again] As they <span class="t8">hooted</span> at his departure, they will <span class="t8">roar</span> at his return; as he went out with scoffs, he will come back with lamentations.</p>

<p class="p24">Ausidius assigns three probable reasons of the miscarriage of Coriolanus; pride, which easily follows an uninterrupted train of success; unskilfulness to regulate the consequences of his own victories; a stubborn uniformity of nature, which could not make the proper transition from the <span class="t8">casque</span> or <span class="t8">helmet</span> to the <span class="t8">cushion</span> or <span class="t8">chair of civil authority</span>; but acted with the same despotism in peace as in war.</p>

One may say with propriety, he brought false witnesses to verify his title. Shakespeare considered the word with his usual laxity, as importing rather <span class="t8">testimony</span> than <span class="t8">truth</span>, and only meant to say, <span class="t8">I</span> bore witness <span class="t8">to my friends with all the size that verity would suffer</span>.</p>

It is not denied that many French words were mingled in the time of Elizabeth with our language, which have since been ejected, and that any which are known to have been then in use may be properly recalled when they will help the sense. But when a word is to be admitted, the first question should be, by whom was it ever received? in what book can it be shown? If it cannot be proved to have been in use, the reasons which can justify its reception must be stronger than any critick will often have to bring. Even in this certain emendation, the new word is very liable to contest. I should read,</p>

<p class="p24">V.iv.22 (439,1) He sits in state as a thing made for Alexander] In a foregoing note he was said to <span class="t8">sit in gold</span>. The phrase, <span class="t8">as a thing made for Alexander</span>, means, <span class="t8">as one made to resemble Alexander</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">V.vi.39 (443,2) He wag&rsquo;d me with his countenance] This is obscure. The meaning, I think, is, he <span class="t8">prescribed</span> to me vith an air of authority, and gave me <span class="t8">his countenance</span> for <span class="t8">my wages</span>; thought me sufficiently rewarded with good looks.</p>
<p class="p24">V.vi.44 (443,3) For which my sinews shall be stretch&rsquo;d upon him] This is the point on which I will attack him with my utmost abilities.</p>
<p class="p24">V.vi.66 (444,4) answering us/With our own charge] That is, <span class="t8">rewarding us with our own expences</span>; making the cost of the war its recompence.</p>
<p class="p24">V.vi.125 (446,5) his fame folds in/This orbe o&rsquo; th&rsquo; earth] His fame overspreads the world.</p>
<p class="p24">(447) General Observation. The tragedy of Coriolanus is one of the most amusing of our author&rsquo;s performances. The old man&rsquo;s merriment in Menenius; the lofty lady&rsquo;s dignity in Volumnia; the bridal modesty in Virgilia; the patrician and military haughtiness in Coriolanus; the plebeian malignity and tribunitian insolence in Brutus and Sicinius, make a very pleasing and interesting variety: and the various revolutions of the hero&rsquo;s fortune fill the mind with anxious curiosity. There is, perhaps, too much bustle in the first act, and too little in the last.</p>
