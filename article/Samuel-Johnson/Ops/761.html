<h2 class="h20"><a id="a1853"></a><a id="a1852"></a>ALL&rsquo;S WELL THAT ENDS WELL</h2>
<p class="p21">I.i.1 (3,2) [In delivering my son from me] [W: dissevering] Of this change I see no need: the present reading is clear, and, perhaps, as proper as that which the great commentator would substitute; for the king <span class="t8">dissevers</span> her son from her, she only <span class="t8">delivers</span> him.</p>
<p class="p24">I.i.5 (4,3) [to whom I am now in ward] Under his particular care, as my guardian, till I come to age. It is now almost forgotten in England that the heirs of great fortunes were the king&rsquo;s <span class="t8">wards</span>. Whether the same practice prevailed in France, it is of no great use to enquire, for Shakespeare gives to all nations the manners of England.</p>
<p class="p24">I. i.19 (4,5) [This young gentlewoman had a father, (O, that <span class="t8">had</span>! how sad a passage &rsquo;tis!)] [W: presage &rsquo;tis] This emendation is ingenious, perhaps preferable to the present reading, yet since <span class="t8">passage</span> may be fairly enough explained, I have left it in the text. <span class="t8">Passage</span> is <span class="t8">anything that passes</span>, so we now say, a <span class="t8">passage</span> of an <span class="t8">authour</span>. and we said about a century ago, the <span class="t8">passages</span> of a <span class="t8">reign</span>. When the <span class="t8">countess</span> mentions Helena&rsquo;s loss of a father, she recollects her own loss of a husband, and stops to observe how heavily that word <span class="t8">had</span> passes through her mind.</p>
<p class="p24">I.i.48 (6,6) [for where an unclean mind carries virtuous qualities, there commendations go with pity, they are virtues and traitors too; in her they are the better for their simpleness; she derives her honesty, and atchieves her goodness] [W: her simpleness] This is likewise a plausible but unnecessary alteration. <span class="t8">Her virtues are the better for their simpleness</span>, that is, her excellencies are the better because they are artless and open, without fraud, without design. The learned commentator has well explained <span class="t8">virtues</span>. but has not, I think, reached the force of the word <span class="t8">traitors</span>, and therefore has not shown the full extent of Shakespeare&rsquo;s masterly observation. <span class="t8">Virtues in an unclean mind are virtues and traitors too</span>. Estimable and useful qualities, joined with evil disposition, give that evil disposition power over others, who, by admiring the virtue, are betrayed to the malevolence. The <span class="t8">Tatler</span> mentioning the sharpers of his time, observes, that some of them are men of such elegance and knowledge, that <span class="t8">a young man who falls into their way is</span> betrayed <span class="t8">as much by his judgment as his passions</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">I.i.86 (7,8) [If the living be enemy to the grief, the excess makes it soon mortal] [W: be not enemy] This emendation I had once admitted into the text, but restored the old reading, because I think it capable of an easy explication. <span class="t8">Lafeu</span> says, <span class="t8">excessive grief is the enemy of the living</span>: the countess replies, <span class="t8">If the living be an enemy to grief, the excess soon makes it mortal</span>: that is, <span class="t8">if the living do not indulge grief, grief destroys itself by its own excess</span>. By the word <span class="t8">mortal</span> I understand <span class="t8">that which dies</span>, and Dr. Warburton, <span class="t8">that which destroys</span>. I think that my interpretation gives a sentence more acute and more refined. Let the reader judge.</p>
<p class="p24">I.i.78 (8,9) [That thee may furnish] That may help thee with more and better qualifications.</p>
<p class="p24">I.i.84 (8,1) [The best wishes that can beforg&rsquo;d in your thoughts, be servants to you!] That is, may you be mistress of your wishes, and have power to bring then to effect.</p>
<p class="p24">I.i.91 (8,2) [And these great tears grace his remembrance more] The tears which the king and countess shed for him.</p>
<p class="p24">I.i.99 (8,3) [In his bright radiance and collateral light Must I be comforted, not in his sphere] I cannot be united with him and move in the same <span class="t8">sphere</span>, but <span class="t8">must be comforted</span> at a distance by the <span class="t8">radiance</span> that shoots <span class="t8">on all sides</span> from him.</p>
<p class="p24">I.i.107 (9,4) [Of every line and trick of his sweet favour!] So in King John; <span class="t8">he hath a</span> trick <span class="t8">of Coeur de Lion&rsquo;s face. Trick</span> seen to be some peculiarity of look or feature.</p>
<p class="p24">I.i.122 (9,6) [you have some stain of soldier in you] [W: <span class="t8">&ldquo;Stain</span> for colour.&rdquo;] <span class="t8">Stain</span> rather for what we now say <span class="t8">tincture</span>, some qualities, at least superficial, of a soldier. (1773)</p>
<p class="p24">I.i.150 (10,8) [He, that hangs himself, is a virgin] [W: As heâ€¦so is] I believe most readers Will spare both the emendations, which I do not think much worth a claim or a contest. The old reading is more spritely and equally just.</p>
<p class="p24">I.i.165 (11,1) [Marry, ill, to like him that ne&rsquo;er it likes] Parolles, in answer to the question, <span class="t8">how one shall lose virginity to her own liking?</span> plays upon the word <span class="t8">liking</span>, and says, <span class="t8">she must do ill, for</span> virginity, to be so lost, <span class="t8">must like him that likes not</span> virginity.</p>
<p class="p24">I.i.178-191 (12,5) [Not my virginity yet] This whole speech is abrupt, unconnected, and obscure. Dr. Warburton thinks much of it suppofititious. I would be glad to think so of the whole, for a commentator naturally wishes to reject what he cannot understand. Something, which should connect Helena&rsquo;s words with those of Parolles, seems to be wanting. Hammer has made a fair attempt by reading,</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Not my virginity yet</span> &mdash; You&rsquo;re for the court, <span class="t8">There shall your master</span>, &amp;c.</p>
<p class="p24">Some such clause has, I think, dropped out, but still the first words want connection. Perhaps Parolles, going away after his harangue, said, <span class="t8">will you any thing with me</span>? to which Helen may reply &mdash; I know not what to do with the passage.</p>
<p class="p24">I.i.184 (13,7) [a traitress] It seems that traitress was in that age a term of endearment, for when Lafeu introduces Helena to the king, he says, <span class="t8">You like a</span> traytor, <span class="t8">but such</span> traytors <span class="t8">his majesty does not much fear</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">I.i.199 (14,8) [And shew what we alone must think] And <span class="t8">shew</span> by realities what we now <span class="t8">must only think</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">I.i.218 (14,9) [is a virtue of a good wing, and I like the wear well] [W: good ming] This conjecture I could wish to see better proved. This <span class="t8">common</span> word <span class="t8">ming</span> I have never found. The first edition of this play exhibits wing without a capital: yet, I confess, that a <span class="t8">virtue of good wing</span> is an expression that I cannot understand, unless by a metaphor taken from falconry, it may mean, <span class="t8">a virtue that will fly high</span>, and in the stile of Hotspur, <span class="t8">Pluck honour from the moon</span>.</p>
<p class="p26">I.i.235 (15,1) [What power is it, which mounts my love so high;<br/>That makes me see, and cannot feed mine eye?]</p>
<p class="p24">She means, by what influence is my love directed to a person so much above me. [why am I made to discern excellence, sad left to long after it, without the food of hope.]</p>
<p class="p24">I.i.237 (15,2)</p>
<p class="p26">[The mightiest space in fortune, nature brings<br/>To join like likes, and kiss, like native things.<br/>Impossible be strange attempts, to those<br/>That weigh their pain in sense; and do suppose,<br/>What hath been]</p>
<p class="p24">All these four lines are obscure, and, I believe, corrupt. I shall propose an emendation, which those who can explain the present reading, are at liberty to reject.</p>
<p class="p26">Through <span class="t8">mightiest space in fortune nature brings</span><br/>Likes to join likes, <span class="t8">and kiss, like native things.</span></p>
<p class="p24">That is, <span class="t8">nature</span> brings <span class="t8">like qualities</span> and dispositions <span class="t8">to meet</span> through any <span class="t8">distance</span> that <span class="t8">fortune</span> may have set between them; she <span class="t8">joins</span> them and makes them <span class="t8">kiss like things born together.</span></p>
<p class="p24">The next lines I read with Hammer.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Impossible be strange attempts to those That weigh their pains in sense, and do suppose What</span> ha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t <span class="t8">been, cannot be.</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">New</span> attempts seen impossible to those who estimate their <span class="t8">labour</span> or <span class="t8">enterprises</span> by sense, and believe that nothing can be but what they see before them.</p>
<p class="p24">I.ii.32 (17,3)</p>
<p class="p26">[He had the wit, which I can well observe<br/>To-day in our young lords, but they may jest,<br/>Till their own scorn return to them; unnoted,<br/>Ere they can hide their levity in honour]</p>
<p class="p24">I believe <span class="t8">honour</span> is not <span class="t8">dignity of birth or rank,</span> but <span class="t8">acquired reputation: Your father</span>, says the king, <span class="t8">had the same airy flights of satirical wit-with the young lords of the present time, but they do not what he did</span>, hide their unnoted <span class="t8">levity</span> in honour, <span class="t8">cover petty faults with great merit.</span></p>
<p class="p24">This is an excellent observation. Jocose follies, and slight offences, are only allowed by mankind in him that overpowers them by great qualities.</p>
<p class="p24">I.ii.36 (18,4)</p>
<p class="p26">[So like a courtier, contempt nor bitterness<br/>Were in his pride or sharpness; if they were,<br/>His equal had awak&rsquo;d them]</p>
<p class="p24">[W: no contempt or] The original edition reads the first line thus,</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">So like a courtier, contempt</span> nor <span class="t8">bitterness.</span></p>
<p class="p24">The sense is the same. <span class="t8">Nor</span> was used without reduplication. So in <span class="t8">Measure for Measure,</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">More</span> nor <span class="t8">less to others paying, Than by self-offences weighing.</span></p>
<p class="p24">The old text needs to be explained. He was so like a courtier, that there was in <span class="t8">his dignity of manner nothing contemptuous,</span> and</p>
<p class="p24">I.ii.41 (19, 5) [His tongue obey&rsquo;d his hand] We should read,</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">His tongue obeyed</span> the <span class="t8">hand.</span></p>
<p class="p24">That is, the <span class="t8">hand</span> of <span class="t8">his honour&rsquo;s clock,</span> shewing <span class="t8">the true minute when exceptions bad him speak.</span></p>
<p class="p24">I.ii.44 (19, 7) [Making then proud of his humility, In their poor praise he humbled] [W: proud; and his] Every man has seen the <span class="t8">mean</span> too often <span class="t8">proud</span> of the <span class="t8">humility</span> of the great, and perhaps the great may sometimes be <span class="t8">humbled in the praises</span> of the mean, of those who commend them without conviction or discernment: this, however is not so common; the <span class="t8">mean</span> are found more frequently than the <span class="t8">great.</span></p>
<p class="p24">I.ii.50 (19, 8)</p>
<p class="p26">[So in approof lives not his epitaph,<br/>As in your royal speech]</p>
<p class="p24">[W: <span class="t8">Epitaph</span> for character.] I should wish to read,</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Approof</span> so lives not <span class="t8">in his</span> epitaph, <span class="t8">As in your royal speech.</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Approof</span> is <span class="t8">approbation.</span> If I should allow Dr. <span class="t8">Warburton&rsquo;s</span> interpretation of <span class="t8">Epitaph,</span> which is more than can be reasonably expected, I can yet find no sense in the present reading.</p>
<p class="p24">I.ii.61 (20, 9) [<span class="t8">whose judgments are meer fathers of their garments</span>] Who have no other use of their faculties, than to invent new modes of dress.</p>
<p class="p24">I.iii (21, 1) [<span class="t8">Enter Countess, Steward, and Clown</span>] A <span class="t8">Clown</span> in Shakespeare is commonly taken for a <span class="t8">licensed jester,</span> or domestick <span class="t8">fool.</span> We are not to wonder that we find this character often in his plays, since fools were, at that time, maintained in all great families, to keep up merriment in the house. In the picture of Sir Thomas More&rsquo;s family, by Hans Holbein, the only servant represented is Patison the <span class="t8">fool.</span> This is a proof of the familiarity to which they were admitted, not by the great only, but the wise.</p>
<p class="p24">In some plays, a servant, or a rustic, of remarkable petulance and freedom of speech, is likewise called a clown.</p>
<p class="p24">I.iii.3 (21, 2) [to even your content] To act up to your desires.</p>
<p class="p24">I.iii.45 (23, 4) [You are shallow, madam, in great friends; for the knaves come to do that for me, which I am a weary of] [Tyrwhitt: my great] The meaning seems to be, you are not deeply skilled in the character of offices of great friends. (1773)</p>
<p class="p24">I.iii.96 (26, 1) [Clo. That man should be at woman&rsquo;s command, and yet no hurt done! &mdash; Tho&rsquo; honesty be no puritan, yet it will do no hurt; it will wear the surplice of humility over the black gown of a big heart] The clown&rsquo;s answer is obscure. His lady bids him do as he is <span class="t8">commanded.</span> He answers with the licentious petulance of his character, that <span class="t8">if a man does as a woman commands, it is likely he will do amiss;</span> that he does not amiss, being at the command of a woman, he makes the effect, not of his lady&rsquo;s goodness, but of his own <span class="t8">honesty,</span> which, though not very nice or <span class="t8">puritanical,</span> will <span class="t8">do no hurt;</span> and will not only do no hurt, but, unlike the <span class="t8">puritans</span>, will comply with the injunctions of superiors, and wear the <span class="t8">surplice of humility over the black gown of a big heart</span>; will obey commands, though not much pleased with a state of subjection.</p>
<p class="p24">Here is an allusion, violently enough forced in, to satirize the obstinacy with which the <span class="t8">puritans</span> refused the use of the ecclesiastical habits, which was, at that time, one principal cause of the breach of union, and, perhaps, to insinuate, that the modest purity of the surplice was sometimes a cover for pride.</p>
<p class="p24">I.iii.140 (28,3) [By our remembrances] That is, <span class="t8">according to</span> our recollection. So we say, he is old <span class="t8">by</span> my reckoning.</p>
<p class="p24">I.iii.169 (29,5)</p>
<p class="p24">[ &mdash; or, were you both our mothers I care no more for, than I do for heaven. So I were not his sister]</p>
<p class="p24">[W: I can no more fear, than I do fear heav&rsquo;n.] I do not much yield to this emendation; yet I have not been able to please myself with any thing to which even my own partiality can give the preference.</p>
<p class="p24">Sir Thomas Banner reads,</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Or were you both our mothers</span>. I cannot ask for more than that of heaven. <span class="t8">So I were not his sister</span>; can be no other Way <span class="t8">I your daughter</span>, but <span class="t8">he must be my brother</span>?</p>
<p class="p24">I.iii.171 (30,6) [can&rsquo;t no other, But, I your daughter, he must be my brother?] The meaning is obscur&rsquo;d by the elliptical diction. Can <span class="t8">it</span> be <span class="t8">no other</span> way, but if <span class="t8">I</span> be <span class="t8">your daughter he must be my brother</span>?</p>
<p class="p24">I.iii.178 (30,8) [Your salt tears&rsquo; head] The force, the fountain of your tears, the cause of your grief.</p>
<p class="p24">I.iii.208 (31,9) [captious and intenible sieve] The word <span class="t8">captious</span> I never found in this sense; yet I cannot tell what to substitute, unless <span class="t8">carious,</span> for <span class="t8">rotten</span>, which yet is a word more likely to have been mistaken by the copyers than used by the author.</p>
<p class="p24">I.iii.232 (32,2)</p>
<p class="p26">[As notes, whose faculties inclusive were<br/>Receipts in which greater <span class="t8">virtues</span> were inclosed]</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Do not throw from you; you, my lord,, farewell; Share the advice betwixt you; if both</span> gain all, <span class="t8">The gift doth stretch itself as &rsquo;tis receiv&rsquo;d, And is enough for both.</span></p>
<p class="p24">The first edition, from which the passage is restored, was sufficiently clear; yet it is plain, that the latter editors preferred a reading which they did not understand.</p>
<p class="p24">II.i.12 (35,8)</p>
<p class="p26">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[let higher Italy<br/>(Those &lsquo;hated, that inherit but the fall<br/>Of the last monarchy) [see, that you come<br/>Not to woo honour, but to wed it]</p>
<p class="p24">[Hammer: Those bastards that inherit] Dr. Warburton&rsquo;s observation is learned, but rather too subtle; Sir Tho. Hanmer&rsquo;s alteration is merely arbitrary. The passage is confessedly obscure, and there-fore I may offer another explanation. I am of opinion that the epithet <span class="t8">higher</span> is to be understood of situation rather than of dignity. The sense may then be this,<span class="t8">Let upper Italy,</span> where you are to exercise your valour, <span class="t8">see that you come to gain honour, to the</span> abatement, <span class="t8">that is, to the disgrace and depression of those</span> that have now lost their ancient military fame, and <span class="t8">inherit but the fall of the last monarchy</span>. To <span class="t8">abate</span> is used by Shakespeare in the original sense of <span class="t8">abatre</span>, to <span class="t8">depress</span>, to <span class="t8">sink</span>, to <span class="t8">deject</span>, to <span class="t8">subdue</span>. So in Coriolanus,</p>
<p class="p26">&mdash; &lsquo;<span class="t8">till ignorance deliver you.<br/>As moat</span> abated <span class="t8">captives to some nation<br/>That won you without blows</span>.<br/>And bated is used in a kindred sense in the Jew of Venice.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&mdash; in a bondman&rsquo;s key With <span class="t8">bated</span> breath and whisp&rsquo;ring humbleness.</p>
<p class="p24">The word has still the same meaning in the language of the law.</p>
<p class="p24">II.i.21 (37,9) [Beware of being captives, Before you serve] The word <span class="t8">serve</span> is equivocal; the sense is, <span class="t8">Be not captives before </span>you serve in the war. <span class="t8">Be not captives before you are soldiers.</span></p>
<p class="p24">II.i.36 (37,1) [I grow to you, and our parting is a tortur&rsquo;d body] I read thus, <span class="t8">Our parting is</span> the parting of <span class="t8">a tortured body.</span> Our parting is as the disruption of limbs torn from each other. Repetition of a word is often the cause of mistakes, the eye glances on the wrong word, and the intermediate part of the sentence is omitted.</p>
<p class="p24">II.i.54 (38,3) [they wear themselves in the cap of the time, there, do muster true gait] [W: to muster] I think this amendation cannot be said to give much light to the obscurity of the passage. Perhaps it might be read thus, They do <span class="t8">muster</span> with the <span class="t8">true gaite.</span> that is, they have the true military step. Every man has observed something peculiar in the strut of a soldier, (rev. 1778, IV,35,8)</p>
<p class="p24">II.i.70 (39,4) [across] This word, as has been already observed, is used when any pass of wit miscarries.</p>
<p class="p24">II.i.74 (39,5) [Yes, but you will, my noble grapes, as if] These words,<span class="t8">my noble grapes</span>, seem to Dr. Warburton and Sir T. Hammer, to stand so much in the way, that they have silently omitted them. They may be indeed rejected without great loss, but I believe they are Shakespeare&rsquo;s words. <span class="t8">You will eat</span>, says Lafen, <span class="t8">no grapes. Yes, but you will eat such noble grapes</span> as I bring you, <span class="t8">if you could reach them.</span></p>
<p class="p24">II.i. 100 (41,8) [I am Cressid&rsquo;s uncle] I am like Pandarus. See Troilus and Cressida. (see 1765, III,310,2)</p>
<p class="p24">II.i.114 (41,9) [wherein the honour Of my dear father&rsquo;s gift stands chief in power] Perhaps we may better read, &mdash; <span class="t8">wherein the power Of my dear father&rsquo;s gift stands chief in</span> honour,</p>
<p class="p24">II.i.144 (42,1) [When miracles have by the greatest been deny&rsquo;d] I do not see the import or connection of this line. As the next line stands without a correspondent rhyme, I suspect that something has been lost.</p>
<p class="p24">II.i.159 (43,2) [Myself against the level of mine aim] I rather think that she means to say, <span class="t8">I am not an impostor that proclaim</span> one thing and design another, <span class="t8">that proclaim</span> a cure and aim at a fraud: I think what I speak.</p>
<p class="p24">II.i.174 (43,3)</p>
<p class="p26">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[a divulged shame<br/>Traduc&rsquo;d by odious ballds; my maiden&rsquo;s name<br/>Sear&rsquo;d otherwise; no worse of worst extended,<br/>With vilest torture let my life be ended]</p>
<p class="p24">This passage is apparently corrupt, and how shall it be rectified? I have no great hope of success, but something must be tried. I read the whole thus,</p>
<p class="p26">King. <span class="t8">What darest thou venture?</span><br/>Hal. <span class="t8">Tax of impudence.<br/>A strumpet&rsquo;s boldness; a divulged shame,<br/>Traduc&rsquo;d by odious ballads my maiden name;<br/>Sear&rsquo;d otherwise,</span> to worst <span class="t8">of worst extended;<br/>With vilest torture let my life be ended.</span></p>
<p class="p24">When this alteration first came into my mind, I supposed Helen to mean thus, <span class="t8">First,</span> I venture what is dearest to me, my maiden reputation; but if your distrust <span class="t8">extends</span> my character <span class="t8">to the worst of</span> the worst, and supposes me <span class="t8">seared</span> against the sense of infamy, I will add to the stake of reputation, the stake of life. This certainly is sense, and the language as grammatical as many other passages of Shakespeare. Yet we may try another experiment.</p>
<p class="p26">Fear <span class="t8">otherwise</span> to worst of <span class="t8">worst extended;<br/>With vilest torture let my life be ended.</span><br/>That is, let me act under the greatest terrors possible.</p>
<p class="p24">But once again we will try to find the right way by the glimmer of Hanmer&rsquo;s amendation, who reads thus,</p>

<p class="p24">As the whole merriment of this scene consists in the pretensions of Parollei to knowledge and sentiments which he has not, I believe here are two passages in which the words and sense are bestowed upon him by the copies, which the author gave to Lafen. I read this passage thus,</p>
<p class="p26">Laf. <span class="t8">To be relinquished of the artists &mdash;&mdash; </span><br/>Par. <span class="t8">So I. say.</span><br/>Laf. <span class="t8">Both of Galen and Paracelsus, of all the<br/>learned and authentick fellows &mdash;&mdash; </span><br/>Par. Right, so I say.</p>

<p class="p24">[which should, indeed, give us a farther use to be made, than alone the recovery of the King; as to be &mdash; <span class="t8">Laf.</span> Generally thankful]</p>
<p class="p24">I cannot see that there is any <span class="t8">hiatus</span>, or other irregularity of language than such as is very common in these plays. I believe Parolles has again usurped words and sense to which he has no right; and I read this passage thus,</p>
<p class="p24">Laf. <span class="t8">In a most weak and debile minister, great power, great transcendence; which should, indeed, give us a farther use to be made than the mere recovery of the king.</span> Par. <span class="t8">As to be.</span> Laf. <span class="t8">Generally thankful.</span></p>

<p class="p26">II.iii.77 (53,1) [Let the white death sit on thy cheek for ever]<br/>[W: dearth] The white death is the chlorosis.</p>
<p class="p24">II.iii.80 (53,2) [And to imperial Love] [W. The old editions read IMPARTIAL, which is right.] There is no edition of this play older than that of 1623, the next is that of 1632, of which both read imperials the second reads imperial Jove.</p>
<p class="p24">II.iii.92 (53,3) [Laf. Do they all deny her?] None of them have yet denied her, or deny her afterwards but Bertram. The scene must be so regulated that Lafeu and Parolles talk at a distance, where they nay see what passes between Helena and the lords, but not hear it, so that they know not by whom the refusal is made.</p>
<p class="p24">II.iii.105 (54,4) [There&rsquo;s one grape yet, &mdash; I am sure, they father drunk wine. &mdash; But if thou be&rsquo;st not an ass, I am a youth of fourteen. I have known thee already] This speech the three last editors have perplexed themselves by dividing between Lafeu and Parolles, without any authority of copies, or any improvement of sense. I have restored the old reading, and should have thought no explanation necessary, but that Mr. Theobald apparently misunderstood it.</p>
<p class="p24">Old Lafeu having, upon the supposition that the lady was refused, reproached the young lords as <span class="t8">boys of ice</span>, throwing his eyes on Bertram who remained, cries out, &ldquo;<span class="t8">There is one yet into whom his father put good blood, &mdash;&mdash; but I have known thee long enough to know thee for an ass</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">II.iii.135 (55,6) [good alone Is good, without a name, vileness is so] [W: good; and with a name,] The present reading is certainly wrong, and, to confess the truth, I do not think Dr. Warburton&rsquo;s emendation right; yet I have nothing that I can propose with much confidence. Of all the conjectures that I can make, that which least displeases me is this:</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&mdash; <span class="t8">good alone. Is good without a name</span>; Helen <span class="t8">is so</span>;</p>
<p class="p24">The rest follows easily by this change.</p>

<p class="p26">[ &mdash; She is young, wise, fair;<br/>In these, to nature she&rsquo;s immediate heir;<br/>And these breed honour]</p>
<p class="p24">Here is a long note [W&rsquo;s] which I wish had been shorter. <span class="t8">Good</span> is better than <span class="t8">young</span>, as it refers to <span class="t8">honour</span>. But she is more the <span class="t8">immediate heir</span> of <span class="t8">nature</span> with respect to <span class="t8">youth</span> than <span class="t8">goodness</span>. To be <span class="t8">immediate heir</span> is to inherit without any intervening transmitter: thus she inherits beauty <span class="t8">immediately</span> from <span class="t8">nature</span>, but honour is transmitted by ancestors; youth is received <span class="t8">immediately</span> from <span class="t8">nature</span>. but <span class="t8">goodness</span> may be conceived in part the gift of parents, or the effect of education. The alteration therefore loses on one side what it gains on the other.</p>
<p class="p24">II.iii.170 (58,9) [Into the staggers] One species of the <span class="t8">staggers</span>, or the <span class="t8">horses apoplexy</span>, is a raging impatience which makes the animal dash himself with destructive violence against posts or walls. To this the allusion, I suppose, is made.</p>
<p class="p24">II.iii.185 (59,1)</p>
<p class="p24">[whose ceremony Shall seem expedient on the now-born brief, And be perform&rsquo;d to-night]</p>
<p class="p26">This, if it be at all intelligible, is at least obscure and inaccurate.<br/>Perhaps it was written thus,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&mdash; what <span class="t8">ceremony Shall seem expedient on the now-born brief</span> Shall <span class="t8">be perform&rsquo;d to-night; the solemn feast</span> <span class="t8">Shall more attend</span> &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">The <span class="t8">brief</span> is the <span class="t8">contract of espousal</span>, or the <span class="t8">licence</span> of the church. The King means, What <span class="t8">ceremony</span> is necessary to make this <span class="t8">contract a marriage</span>, shall be immediately <span class="t8">performed</span>; the rest may be delayed.</p>

<p class="p24">II.iii.217 (60,3) [yet art then good for nothing but taking up] To take up, is to <span class="t8">contradict</span>, to <span class="t8">call to account</span>, as well as to <span class="t8">pick off the ground</span>.</p>

<p class="p24">II.iii.309 (63,9) [To the dark house] The <span class="t8">dark house</span> is a house made gloomy by discontent. Milton says of <span class="t8">death</span> and the <span class="t8">king</span> of hell preparing to combat,</p>

<p class="p24">III.ii.100 (74,3) [Not so, but as we change our courtesies] The gentlemen declare that they are servants to the Countess, she replies, No otherwise than as she returns the same offices of civility.</p>

<p class="p24">III.iv.19 (77,6) [Rinaldo, you did never lack advice so much] <span class="t8">Advice</span>, is <span class="t8">discretion</span> or <span class="t8">thought</span>.</p>

<p class="p26">&nbsp;[No more of that!<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;I pr&rsquo;ythee, do not strive against my vows:<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;I was compell&rsquo;d to her]</p>
<p class="p24">I know not well what Bertram can mean by entreating Diana <span class="t8">not to strive against his vows</span>. Diana has just mentioned his <span class="t8">wife</span>, so that the <span class="t8">vows</span> seem to relate to his marriage. In this sense not Diana, but himself, <span class="t8">strives against his vows</span>. His <span class="t8">vows</span> indeed may mean <span class="t8">vows</span> made to Diana; but, in that case, to <span class="t8">strive against</span> is not properly used for to reject, nor does this sense cohere well with his first exclamation of impatience at the mention of his wife. <span class="t8">No more of that</span>! Perhaps we might read,</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">I Pr&rsquo;ythee do not</span> drive against my vows.</p>
<p class="p24">Do not run <span class="t8">upon that topick; talk of any thing else that I can bear to hear</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">I have another conceit upon this passage, which I would be thought to offer without much confidence:</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">No more of that</span>! <span class="t8">I pr&rsquo;ythee do not</span> strive &mdash; <span class="t8">against my</span> voice <span class="t8">I was compell&rsquo;d to her.</span></p>
<p class="p24">Diana tells him unexpectedly of his wife. He answers with perturbation, <span class="t8">No more of that! I pr&rsquo;ythee do not</span> play the confessor &mdash; <span class="t8">against my own</span> consent <span class="t8">I was compelled to her</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">When a young profligate finds his courtship so gravely repressed by an admonition of his duty, he very naturally desires the girl not to take upon her the office of a confessor.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.ii.23 (95,6) [What is not holy, that we swear not &lsquo;bides] [W: not &lsquo;bides] This is an acute and excellent conjecture, and I have done it the due honour of exalting it to the text; yet, methinks, there is something yet wanting. The following words, <span class="t8">but take the High&rsquo;st to witness</span>, even though it be understood as an anticipation or assumption in this sense, &mdash; <span class="t8">but</span> now suppose that you <span class="t8">take the</span> Highest <span class="t8">to witness</span>, &mdash; has not sufficient relation to the antecedent sentence. I will propose a reading nearer to the surface, and let it take its chance.</p>
<p class="p24">Ber. <span class="t8">How have I sworn</span>!</p>
<p class="p26">&nbsp;&nbsp;Diana. <span class="t8">&rsquo;Tis not the many oaths, that make the truth,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the plain single vow, that is vow&rsquo;d true</span>.</p>
<p class="p26">&nbsp;&nbsp;Ber. <span class="t8">What is not holy, that we swear not by.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But take the High&rsquo;st to witness</span>.</p>
<p class="p26">&nbsp;&nbsp;Diana. <span class="t8">Then, pray tell me.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I should swear</span>, &amp;c.</p>
<p class="p24">Bertram means to enforce his suit, by telling her, that he has bound himself to her, not by the pretty protestations usual among lovers, but by vows of greater solemnity. She then makes a proper and rational reply.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.ii.25 (96,7) [If I should swear by Jove&rsquo;s great attributes] In the print of the old folio, it is doubtful whether it be <span class="t8">Jove&rsquo;s</span> or <span class="t8">Love&rsquo;s</span>, the characters being not distinguishable. If it is read <span class="t8">Love&rsquo;s</span>, perhaps it may be something less difficult. I am still at a loss.</p>
<p class="p24">It may be read thus,</p>
<p class="p24">&mdash; &ldquo;this has no holding, &ldquo;To swear by him whom I <span class="t8">attest</span> to love, &ldquo;That I will work against him.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">There is no consistence in expressing reverence for Jupiter by calling him to <span class="t8">attest</span> my love, and shewing at the same time, by <span class="t8">working against him</span> by a wicked passion, that I have no respect to the name which I invoke. (1773)</p>
<p class="p24">IV.ii.28 (96,8) [To swear by him whom I protest to love, That I will work against him] This passage likewise appears to me corrupt. She swears not <span class="t8">by</span> him whom she <span class="t8">loves</span>, but by Jupiter. I believe we may read, <span class="t8">to swear</span> to <span class="t8">him</span>. There is, says she, no <span class="t8">holding</span>, no consistency, in swearing to one that <span class="t8">I love him</span>, when I swear it only to <span class="t8">injure</span> him.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.ii.73 (98,9) [Since Frenchmen are so braid, Marry that will, I&rsquo;ll live and die a maid] [W: Marry &lsquo;em] The passage is very unimportant, and the old reading reasonable enough. Nothing is more common than for girls, on such occasions, to say in a pet what they do not think, or to think for a time what they do not finally resolve.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.iii.7 (98,1) [I <span class="t8">Lord</span>] The later editors have with great liberality bestowed lordship upon these interlocutors, who, in the original edition, are called, with more propriety, <span class="t8">capt</span>. E. and <span class="t8">capt</span>. G. It is true that <span class="t8">captain</span> E. is in a former scene called <span class="t8">lord</span> E. but the subordination in which they seem to act, and the timorous manner in which they converse, determines them to be only captains. Yet as the later readers of Shakespeare have been used to find them lords, I have not thought it worth while to degrade them in the margin.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.iii.29 (99,2) [he, that in this action contrives against his own nobility, in his proper stream o&rsquo;erflows himself] That is, <span class="t8">betrays his own secrets in his own talk</span>. The reply shows that this is the meaning.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.iii.38 (100,3) [he might take a measure of his own judgment] This is a very just and moral reason. Bertram, by finding how erroneously he has judged, will be less confident, and more easily moved by admonition.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.iii.113 (102,4) [bring forth this counterfeit module] [W: medal] <span class="t8">Module</span> being the <span class="t8">pattern</span> of any thing, may be here used in that sense. Bring forth this fellow, who, by <span class="t8">counterfeit</span> virtue pretended to make himself a <span class="t8">pattern</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.iii.237 (106,8) [Dian. <span class="t8">the Count&rsquo;s a fool, and full of gold</span>] After this line there is apparently a line lost, there being no rhime that corresponds to gold.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.iii.254 (106,9) [Half won, is match well made; match, and well make it] This line has no meaning that I can find. I read, with a very slight alteration, <span class="t8">Half won is match well made</span>; watch, <span class="t8">and well make it</span>. That is, <span class="t8">a match well made is half won; watch, and make it well</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">This is, in my opinion, not all the error. The lines are misplaced, and should be read thus:</p>
<p class="p26">&nbsp;<span class="t8">Half won is match well made; watch, and well make it;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;when he swears oaths, bid him drop gold, and take it.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;After he scores, he never pays the score:<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;He never pays after-debts, take it before.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;And say &mdash;&mdash; </span></p>
<p class="p24">That is, take his money and leave him to himself. When the players had lost the second line, they tried to make a connection out of the rest. Part is apparently in couplets, and the note was probably uniform.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.iii.280 (107,1) [He will steal, sir, an egg out of a cloister] I know not that <span class="t8">cloister</span>, though it may etymologically signify <span class="t8">any</span> <span class="t8">thing shut</span> is used by our author, otherwise than for a <span class="t8">monastery</span>, and therefore I cannot guess whence this hyperbole could take its original: perhaps it means only this: <span class="t8">He will steal any thing, however trifling, from any place, however holy</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.iii.307 (108,2) [he&rsquo;s a cat still] That is, throw him how you will, he lights upon his legs. [Steevens offered another explanation] I an still of my former opinion. The same speech was applied by king James to Coke, with respect to his subtilties of law, that throw him which way we would, he could still like a cat light upon his legs. (see 1765, III,372,1)</p>
<p class="p24">IV.iii.317 (109,3) [Why does he ask him of me?] This is nature. Every man is on such occasions more willing to hear his neighbour&rsquo;s character than his own.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.iii.332 (109,4) [Only to seem to deserve well, and to beguile the supposition of that lascivious young boy the Count, have I run into this danger] That is, <span class="t8">to deceive the opinion</span>, to make the count think me a man that <span class="t8">deserves well</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.iv.23 (III,6) [When saucy trusting of the cozen&rsquo;d thoughts Defiles the pitchy night!] [W: When Fancy,] This conjecture is truly ingenious, but, I believe, the author of it will himself think it unnecessary, when he recollects that <span class="t8">saucy</span> may very properly signify <span class="t8">luxurious</span>, and by consequence <span class="t8">lascivious</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.iv.31 (112,7)</p>
<p class="p26">&nbsp;[But with the word, the time will bring on summer,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;When briars shall have leaves as well as thorns,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;And be as sweet as sharp]</p>
<p class="p24">The meaning of this observation is, that <span class="t8">as briars</span> have <span class="t8">sweetness</span> with their <span class="t8">prickles</span>, so shall these <span class="t8">troubles</span> be recompensed with <span class="t8">joy</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.iv.34 (112,8) [Our waggon is prepar&rsquo;d, and time revives us] [W: revyes] The present reading is corrupt, and I am afraid the emendation none of the soundest. I never remember to have seen the word <span class="t8">revye</span>. One may as well leave blunders as make them. Why may we not read for a shift, without much effort, <span class="t8">the time</span> invites <span class="t8">us</span>?</p>
<p class="p24">IV.v.8 (114,1) [I would, I had not known him!] This dialogue serves to connect the incidents of Parolles with the main plan of the play.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.v.66 (116,4) [<span class="t8">Laf</span>. A shrewd knave, and an unhappy] That is, <span class="t8">mischievously waggish; unlucky</span>. (see 1765, III,379,3)</p>
<p class="p24">IV.v.70 (116,5) [he has no pace, but runs where he will] [Tyrrwhit: place] A <span class="t8">pace</span> is a certain or prescribed walk, so we say of a man meanly obsequious, that he has learned his <span class="t8">paces</span>. (1773) [(rev. 1778, IV,126,3]</p>

<p class="p26">[I will come after you, with what good speed<br/>Our means will make us means]</p>
<p class="p24">Shakespeare delights much in this kind of reduplication, sometimes so as to obscure his meaning. Helena says, <span class="t8">they will follow with such speed as the means which they have will give them ability to exert</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">V.ii.57 (123,3) [tho&rsquo; you are a fool and a knave, you shall eat] Parolles has many of the lineaments of Falstaff, and seems to be the character which Shakespeare delighted to draw, a fellow that had more wit than virtue. Though justice required that he should be detected and exposed, yet his <span class="t8">vices sit so fit in him</span> that he is not at last suffered to starve.</p>
<p class="p24">V.iii.1 (123,4) [We lost a jewel of her, and our esteem Was made much poorer by it] Dr. Warburton, in Theobald&rsquo;s edition, altered this word to <span class="t8">estate</span>, in his own he lets it stand and explains it by worth or estate. But <span class="t8">esteem</span> is here <span class="t8">reckoning</span> or <span class="t8">estimate</span>. Since the loss of <span class="t8">Helen</span> with her <span class="t8">virtues</span> and <span class="t8">qualifications</span>, our <span class="t8">account</span> is <span class="t8">sunk</span>; what we have to <span class="t8">reckon</span> ourselves king of, is much <span class="t8">poorer</span> than before.</p>

<p class="p24">V.iii.6 (123,6) [done i&rsquo; the blade of youth] In the <span class="t8">spring</span> of <span class="t8">early life</span>, when the man is yet <span class="t8">green</span>, <span class="t8">oil</span> and <span class="t8">fire</span> suit but ill with <span class="t8">blade</span>, and therefore Dr. Warburton reads, <span class="t8">blaze</span> of youth.</p>
<p class="p24">V.iii.21 (124,7) [the first view shall kill All repetition] <span class="t8">The first interview shall put an end to all recollection of the past</span>. Shakespeare is now hastening to the end of the play, finds his matter sufficient to fill up his remaining scenes, and therefore, as on other such occasions, contracts his dialogue and precipitates his action. Decency required that Bertram&rsquo;s double crime of cruelty and disobedience, joined likewise with some hypocrisy, should raise more resentment; and that though his mother might easily forgive him, his king should more pertinaciously vindicate his own authority and Helen&rsquo;s merit: of all this Shakespeare could not be ignorant, but Shakespeare wanted to conclude his play.</p>
<p class="p24">V.iii.50 (125,9) [My high repented blames] [A long note by Warburton] It was but just to insert this note, long as it is, because the commentator seems to think it of importance. Let the reader judge.</p>

<p class="p24">These two lines I should be glad to call <span class="t8">an interpolation of a player</span>. They are ill connected with the former, and not very clear or proper in themselves. I believe the author made two couplets to the same purpose, wrote them both down that he might take his choice, and so they happened to be both preserved.</p>
<p class="p24">For <span class="t8">sleep</span> I think we should read <span class="t8">slept</span>. <span class="t8">Love cries</span> to see what was done while hatred <span class="t8">slept</span>, and suffered mischief to be done. Or the meaning may be, that <span class="t8">hatred</span> still <span class="t8">continues</span> to <span class="t8">sleep</span> at ease, while <span class="t8">love</span> is weeping; and so the present reading may stand.</p>
<p class="p26">V.iii.93 (128,3) [In Florence was it from a casement thrown me]<br/>Bertram still continues to have too little virtue to deserve Helen.<br/>He did not know indeed that it was Helen&rsquo;s ring, but he knew that<br/>he had it not from a window.</p>
<p class="p24">V.iii.95 (128,4) [Noble she was, and thought I stood engag&rsquo;d] [T: I don&rsquo;t understand this reading; if we are to understand, that she thought Bertram engag&rsquo;d to her in affection, insnared by her charms, this meaning is too obscurely express&rsquo;d.] The context rather makes me believe, that the poet wrote,</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">noble she was, and thought I stood</span> ungag&rsquo;d; &mdash;&mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">i.e. unengag&rsquo;d: neither my heart, nor person, dispos&rsquo;d of. &mdash; The plain meaning is, when she saw me receive the ring, she thought me <span class="t8">engaged</span> to her.</p>
<p class="p24">V.iii.101 (129,5) [<span class="t8">King</span> Plutus himself , That knows the tinct and multiplying medicine] Plutus the grand alchemist, who knows the <span class="t8">tincture</span> which confers the properties of gold upon base metals, and the <span class="t8">matter</span> by which <span class="t8">gold</span> is <span class="t8">multiplied</span>, by which a small quantity of gold is made to communicate its qualities to a large mass of metal.</p>
<p class="p24">In the reign of Henry the fourth a law was made to forbid <span class="t8">all men thenceforth to</span> multiply <span class="t8">gold, or use any craft of</span> multiplication. Of which law Mr. Boyle, when he was warm with the hope of transmutation, procured a repeal.</p>
<p class="p24">V.iii.105 (129,6) [Then if you know, That you are well acquainted with yourself] The true meaning of this <span class="t8">strange</span> [Warburton&rsquo;s word] expression is, <span class="t8">If you know that</span> your faculties are so found, as <span class="t8">that you have the proper consciousness of your own actions</span>, and are able to recollect and relate what you have done, <span class="t8">tell me</span>. &amp;c.</p>
<p class="p24">V.iii.121 (130,7)</p>
<p class="p26">[My fore-past proofs, howe&rsquo;er the matter fall,<br/>Shall tax my fears of little vanity,<br/>Having vainly fear&rsquo;d too little]</p>
<p class="p24">The <span class="t8">proofs which I have already had</span>, are sufficient to show that my <span class="t8">fears</span> were not <span class="t8">vain</span> and irrational. I have rather been hither-to more easy than I ought, and have <span class="t8">unreasonably</span> had <span class="t8">too little fear</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">V.iii.131 (130,8) [Who hath, some four or five removes, come short] <span class="t8">Removes</span> are <span class="t8">journies</span> or <span class="t8">post-stages</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">V.iii.191 (133,1) [O, behold this ring. Whose high respect and rich validity] Validity is a very bad word for <span class="t8">value</span>, which yet I think is its meaning, unless it be considered as making a contract <span class="t8">valid</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">V.iii.214 (133,2)</p>
<p class="p26">[As all impediments in fancy&rsquo;s course,<br/>Are motives of more fancy: and in fine,<br/>Her insult coming with her modern grace,<br/>Subdu&rsquo;d me to her rate: she got the ring]</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Every thing that obstructs love is an occasion by which love is heightened. And, to conclude, her solicitation concurring with her fashionable appearance</span>, she got the ring.</p>
<p class="p24">I an not certain that I have attained the true meaning of the word <span class="t8">modern</span>, which, perhaps, signifies rather <span class="t8">meanly pretty</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">V.iii.296-305 (137,3) This dialogue is too long, since the audience already knew the whole transaction; nor is there any reason for puzzling the king and playing with his passions; but it was much easier than to make a pathetical interview between Helen and her husband, her mother, and the king.</p>
<p class="p24">V.iii.305 (137,4) [exorcist] This word is used not very properly for <span class="t8">enchanter</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">V.iii.339 (139,2) [Ours be your patience then, and yours our parts] The meaning is: <span class="t8">Grant us then your patience</span>; hear us without interruption. <span class="t8">And</span> take <span class="t8">our parts</span>; that is, support and defend us. (see 1765, III,399)</p>
<p class="p24">(139) General Observation. This play has many delightful scenes, though not sufficiently probable, and some happy characters, though not new, nor produced by any deep knowledge of human nature. Parolles is a boaster and a coward, such as has always been the sport of the stage, but perhaps never raised more laughter or contempt than in the hands of Shakespeare.</p>
<p class="p24">I cannot reconcile my heart to Bertram; a man noble without generosity, and young without truth; who marries Helen as a coward, and leaves her as a profligate: when she is dead by his unkindness, sneaks home to a second marriage, is accused by a woman whom he has wronged, defends himself by falsehood, and is dismissed to happiness.</p>
<p class="p24">The story of Bertram and Diana hod been told before of Mariana and Angelo, and, to confess the truth, scarcely merited to be heard a second time.</p>
