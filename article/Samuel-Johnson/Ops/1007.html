<p class="p21">Last summer Messrs. Sotheby and Wilkinson sold some very interesting autograph letters written by Johnson to William Strahan, the printer.</p>
<p class="p24">I was fortunate enough to find that the purchasers, with but one exception, were mindful of what Boswell so well describes as &lsquo;the general courtesy of literature,&rsquo; and were ready to place their treasures at my service. To one of them, Mr. Frederick Barker, of 43, Rowan Road, Brook Green, I am still more indebted, for he entrusted me not only with the original letters which he had just bought, but also with some others that he had previously possessed. His Johnsonian collection is one of unusual interest. I have moreover to acknowledge my obligations to Mr. Fawcett, of 14, King Street, Covent Garden; to Messrs. J. Pearson and Co., of 46, Pall Mall; to Messrs. Robson and Kerslake, of Coventry Street, Haymarket; to Mr. Frank T. Sabin, of 10 and 12, Garrick Street, Covent Garden; and to Mr. John Waller, of 2, Artesian Road, Westbourne Grove. Those of the letters which are undated, I have endeavoured to assign to their proper places by internal evidence. The absence of a date is in itself very strong evidence that they belong to a comparatively early period (see <span class="t8">ante</span>, i. 122, n. 2).</p>
<p class="p10">I.</p>
<p class="p21"><span class="t8">A letter about a projected Geographical Dictionary by Mr. Bathurst, with Bathurst&rsquo;s Proposal; dated March 22, probably written in 1753</span>.[In the possession of Mr. Frederick Barker, of 43, Rowan Road, Brook Green.]</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I have inclosed the Scheme which I mentioned yesterday in which the work proposed is sufficiently explained.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The Undertaker, Mr. Bathurst, is a Physician of the University of Cambridge, of about eight years standing, and will perform the work in such a manner as may satisfy the publick. No advice of mine will be wanting, but advice will be all that I propose to contribute unless it should be thought worth while that I should write a preface, which if desired I will do and put my name to it. The terms which I am commissioned to offer are these:</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;1. A guinea and half shall be paid for each sheet of the copy.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;2. The authour will receive a Guinea and half a week from the date of the Contract.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;3. As it is certain that many books will be necessary, the Authour will at the end of the work take the books furnished him in part of payment at prime Cost, which will be a considerable reduction of the price of the Copy; or if it seems as you thought yesterday no reduction, he will allow out of the last payment fifty pounds for the use of the Books and return them.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;4. In two months after his first demand of books shall be supplied, he purposes to write three Sheets a week and to continue the same quantity to the end of the work, unless he shall be hindered by want of Books. He does not however expect to be always able to write according to the order of the Alphabet but as his Books shall happen to supply him, and therefore cannot send any part to the press till the whole is nearly finished.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;5. He undertakes as usual the Correction.</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;I am, Sir, Your most humble servant,<br/>&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;March 22nd.<br/>&lsquo;To Mr. Strahan.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;PROPOSAL.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;There is nothing more apparently wanting to the English Literature, than a Geographical Dictionary, which, though its use is almost every day necessary, not only to Men of Study, but of Trade or publick employment, yet has been hitherto, not only unperformed, but almost unattempted among us. Bohun&rsquo;s Dictionary, the only one which has any pretension to regard, owes that pretension only to its bulk; for it is in all parts contemptibly defective and is therefore deservedly forgotten. In Collier&rsquo;s Dictionary, what Geography there is, can scarcely be found among the crowd of other subjects, and when it is found, is of no great importance. The books of Eachard and Salmon, though useful for the ends proposed by them, are too small to be considered as anticipations of this work, which is intended to consist of two volumes of the same size and print with Harris&rsquo;s Dictionary, in which will be comprised the following particulars:</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The situation of every Country with its Provinces and dependencies according to its present state, and latest observation.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The description of all remarkable Cities, Towns, Castles, Fortresses, and places observable for their situation, products or other particulars.</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;An account of the considerable Rivers, their Springs, Branches, Course,<br/>Outlets, how far navigable, the Produce and Qualities of their waters.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The course of Voyages, giving directions to sailors for navigating from one place of the World to another, with particular attention to the Traffic of these Kingdoms.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;An account of all the principal Ports and Harbours of the known World, in which will be laid down the Pilotage, Bearings, depth of water, danger from Sands or Rocks, firmness or uncertainty of Anchorage, and degree of safety from particular Winds.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;An exact account of the Commodities of each Country, both natural and artificial.</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;A description of the remarkable Animals in every Country, whether<br/>Beasts, Birds or Fishes.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;An account of the Buildings, whether ancient or modern, and of Ruins or other remains of Antiquity.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Remarks upon the soil, air, and waters of particular Places, their several qualities and effects, the accidents to which every Region is exposed, as Earthquakes and Hurricanes, and the diseases peculiar to the Inhabitants or incident to strangers at their arrival.</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;The political State of the World, the Government of Countries, and the<br/>Magistracy of Cities, with their particular Laws, or Privileges.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The most probable and authentic Calculations of the number of Inhabitants of each place.</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;The military state of Countries, their Forces, manner of making War,<br/>Weapons, and naval Power.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The Commercial State, extent of their Trade, Number and strength of their Colonies, quantity of Shipping.</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;The pretensions of Princes with their Alliances, Relations and<br/>Genealogies.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The customs of Nations with regard to Trade, and receptions of strangers, their domestic Customs, as Rites of Marriage and Burial. Their particular Laws. Their habits, recreations and amusements.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The religious Opinions of all Nations.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;These and many other heads of observation will be collected, not merely from the Dictionaries now extant in many Languages, but from the best Surveys, Local Histories, Voyages, and particular accounts, among which care will be taken to select those of the best authority, as the basis of the Work, and to extract from them such observations as may best promote Knowledge and gratify Enquiry, so that it is to be hoped, there will be few remarkable places in the known World, of which the Politician, the Merchant, the Sailor, or the Man of Curiosity may not find a useful and pleasing account, of the credit of which the Reader may always judge, as the Authors from whom it is taken will be regularly quoted, a caution which if some, who have attempted such general works, had observed, their labours would have deserved, and found more favour from the Publick.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">This letter must have been written about the year 1753, for Bathurst is described as a physician of about eight years&rsquo; standing. He took his degree as Bachelor of Medicine at Peterhouse, Cambridge, in 1745, and did not, it should seem, proceed to the higher degree. In 1757 he was at the Havannah, where he died (<span class="t8">ante</span>, i. 242, n. i). He was Johnson&rsquo;s beloved friend, of whom &lsquo;he hardly ever spoke without tears in his eyes&rsquo; (<span class="t8">ante</span>, i. 190, n. 2). The Proposal, I have no doubt, was either written, or at all events revised, by Johnson. It is quite in his style. It may be assumed that it is in Bathurst&rsquo;s handwriting.</p>
<p class="p10">II.</p>
<p class="p21"><span class="t8">An apologetical letter about some work that was passing through the press; undated, but probably written about the years 1753-5</span>.[In the possession of Mr. Frederick Barker.]</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;What you tell me I am ashamed never to have thought on &mdash; I wish I had known it sooner &mdash; Send me back the last sheet; and the last copy for correction. If you will promise me henceforward to print a sheet a day, I will promise you to endeavour that you shall have every day a sheet to print, beginning next Tuesday.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am Sir, Your most, &amp;c.</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To Mr. Strahan.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">In all likelihood Johnson is writing about the Dictionary. The absence of a date, as I have already said, is strong evidence that the letter was written comparatively early. As the first edition of the Dictionary was in folio a sheet consisted of four pages. Johnson writing on April 3, 1753 says, &lsquo;I began the second vol. of my Dictionary, room being left in the first for Preface, Grammar, and History, none of them yet begun&rsquo; (<span class="t8">ante</span>, i. 255). As the book was published on April 15, 1755 (<span class="t8">ante</span>, i. 290, n. 1), the printing must have gone on very rapidly, when a start was once made. By <span class="t8">copy</span> he means his <span class="t8">manuscript for printing</span>.</p>
<p class="p10">III, IV.</p>
<p class="p21"><span class="t8">Two undated letters about printing the Dictionary</span>.[In the possession of Mr. John Waller, 2, Artesian Road, Westbourne Grove.]</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I must desire you to add to your other civilities this one, to go to Mr. Millar and represent to him the manner of going on, and inform him that I know not how to manage. I pay three and twenty shillings a week to my assistants, in each instance having much assistance from them, but they tell me they shall be able to pull better in method, as indeed I intend they shall. The Point is to get two Guineas.</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;Sir, Your humble Servant,<br/>&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;<br/>(Address on back.) &lsquo;To Mr. Strahan.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I have often suspected that it is as you say, and have told Mr. Dodsley of it. It proceeds from the haste of the amanuensis to get to the end of his day&rsquo;s work. I have desired the passages to be clipped close, and then perhaps for two or three leaves it is done. But since poor Stuart&rsquo;s time I could never get that part of the work into regularity, and perhaps never shall. I will try to take some more care but can promise nothing; when I am told there is a sheet or two I order it away. You will find it sometimes close; when I make up any myself, which never happens but when I have nobody with me, I generally clip it close, but one cannot always be on the watch.</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;I am Sir, Your most, &amp;c.<br/>&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">These letters refer to the printing of the <span class="t8">Dictionary</span>, of which Dodsley and Millar were two among the proprietors, and Strahan the printer. Francis Stuart or Stewart was one of Johnson&rsquo;s amanuenses (<span class="t8">ante</span>, i. 187). In 1779 Johnson paid his sister a guinea for an old pocket-book of her brother&rsquo;s (<span class="t8">ante</span>, iii. 418), and wrote on April 8,1780 (<span class="t8">ante</span>, iii. 421):&mdash; &lsquo;The memory of her brother is yet fresh in my mind; he was an ingenious and worthy man.&rsquo; In February 1784 he gave her another guinea for a letter relating to himself that he had found in the pocket-book (<span class="t8">ante</span>, iv. 262). A writer in the <span class="t8">Gent. Mag.</span> for 1799, p. 1171, who had been employed in Strahan&rsquo;s printing-works, says that &lsquo;Stewart was useful to Johnson in the explanation of low cant phrases; all words relating to gambling and card-playing, such as <span class="t8">All-Fours</span>, <span class="t8">Catch-honours</span> [not in Johnson&rsquo;s Dictionary], <span class="t8">Cribbage</span> [merely defined as <span class="t8">A game at cards</span>], were said to be Stewart&rsquo;s corrected by the Doctor.&rsquo; He adds that after the printing had gone on some time &lsquo;the proprietors of the <span class="t8">Dictionary</span> paid Johnson through Mr. Strahan at the rate of a guinea for every sheet of MS. copy delivered. The copy was written upon quarto post, and in two columns each page. Johnson wrote in his own hand the words and their explanation, and generally two or three words in each column, leaving a space between each for the authorities, which were pasted on as they were collected by the different amanuenses employed: and in this mode the MS. was so regular that the sheets of MS. which made a sheet of print could be very exactly ascertained.&rsquo; The same writer states that Stewart in a night ramble in Edinburgh with some of his drinking companions &lsquo;met with the mob conducting Captain Porteous to be hanged; they were next day examined about it before the Town Council, when, as Stewart used to say, &ldquo;we were found to be too drunk to have any hand in the business.&rdquo; He gave an accurate account of it in the Edinburgh Magazine of that time.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p10">V.</p>
<p class="p21"><span class="t8">A letter about Miss Williams, taxes due, and a journey; undated, but perhaps written at Oxford in 1754</span>.[In the possession of Mr. Frederick Barker.]</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I shall not be long here, but in the mean time if Miss Williams wants any money pray speak to Mr. Millar and supply her, they write to me about some taxes which I wish you would pay.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;My journey will come to very little beyond the satisfaction of knowing that there is nothing to be done, and that I leave few advantages here to those that shall come after me.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am Sir, &amp;c.</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;My compliments to Mrs. Strahan.</p>
<p class="p24">To Mr. Strahan.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Miss Williams came to live with Johnson after his wife&rsquo;s death in 1752 (<span class="t8">ante</span>, i. 232). The fact that Strahan is asked to supply her with money after speaking to Mr. Millar seems to show that this letter was written some time before the publication of the <span class="t8">Dictionary</span> in April 1755. Millar &lsquo;took the principal charge of conducting its publication,&rsquo; and Johnson &lsquo;had received all the copy-money, by different drafts, a considerable time before he had finished his task&rsquo; (<span class="t8">ante</span>, i. 287).</p>
<p class="p24">His &lsquo;journey&rsquo; may have been his visit to Oxford in the summer of 1754. He went there, because, &lsquo;I cannot,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;finish my book [the Dictionary] to my mind without visiting the libraries&rsquo; (<span class="t8">ante</span>, i. 270). According to Thomas Warton &lsquo;he collected nothing in the libraries for his <span class="t8">Dictionary</span>&rsquo; (<span class="t8">ib</span> n. 5). It is perhaps to this failure that the latter part of the letter refers, Johnson&rsquo;s visit, however, was one of five weeks, while the first line of the letter shews that he intended to be away from London but a short time.</p>
<p class="p10">VI.</p>
<p class="p21"><span class="t8">A letter about &lsquo;Rasselas,&rsquo; dated</span> Jan. 20, 1759.[In the possession of Mr. Frederick Barker.]</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;When I was with you last night I told you of a story which I was preparing for the press. The title will be</p>
<p class="p24">&ldquo;The Choice of Life</p>
<p class="p24">or</p>
<p class="p24">The History of … Prince of Abissinia.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;It will make about two volumes like little Pompadour, that is about one middling volume. The bargain which I made with Mr. Johnson was seventy five pounds (or guineas) a volume, and twenty five pounds for the second edition. I will sell this either at that price or for sixty, the first edition of which he shall himself fix the number, and the property then to revert to me, or for forty pounds, and I have the profit that is retain half the copy. I shall have occasion for thirty pounds on Monday night when I shall deliver the book which I must entreat you upon such delivery to procure me. I would have it offered to Mr. Johnson, but have no doubt of selling it, on some of the terms mentioned.</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;I will not print my name, but expect it to be known.<br/>I am Dear Sir, Your most humble servant,<br/>SAM. JOHNSON.<br/>Jan. 20, 1759.<br/>Get me the money if you can.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">This letter is of unusual interest, as it proves beyond all doubt that <span class="t8">Rasselas</span> was written some weeks before <span class="t8">Candide</span> was published (see <span class="t8">ante</span>, i. 342, n. a). Baretti, as I have shewn (i. 341, n. 3), says that &lsquo;any other person with the degree of reputation Johnson then possessed would have got £400 for the work, but he never understood the art of making the most of his productions.&rsquo; We see, however, by this letter that Johnson did ask for a larger sum than the booksellers allowed him. He received but one hundred pounds for the first edition, but he had made a bargain for one hundred and fifty pounds or guineas. Johnson, the bookseller, seems to have been but in a small way of business as a publisher. I do not find in the <span class="t8">Gentleman&rsquo;s Magazine</span> for 1758 any advertisement of books published by him, and only one in 1759 (P. 339). Cowper&rsquo;s publisher in 1778 was Joseph Johnson of St. Paul&rsquo;s Churchyard. (Cowper&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Works</span> by Southey, i. 285; see also Nichols&rsquo; <span class="t8">Literary Anecdotes</span>, iii. 461-464.)</p>
<p class="p24">By &lsquo;little Pompadour&rsquo; Johnson, no doubt, means the second and cheaper edition of <span class="t8">The History of the Marchioness de Pompadour</span>. The first edition was published by Hooper in one volume, price five shillings (<span class="t8">Gent. Mag</span>. for October 1758, p. 493). and the second in two volumes for three shillings and sixpence (<span class="t8">Gent. Mag</span>. for November, 1758, p. 543).</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson did not generally &lsquo;print his name.&rsquo; He published anonymously his translation of <span class="t8">Lobos Voyage to Abyssinia; London; The Life of Savage; The Rambler</span>, and <span class="t8">The Idler</span>, both in separate numbers and when collected in volumes; <span class="t8">Rasselas; The False Alarm; Falkland&rsquo;s Islands; The Patriot;</span>, and <span class="t8">Taxation no Tyranny</span>; (when these four pamphlets were collected in a volume he published them with the title of <span class="t8">Political Tracts, by the Authour of the Rambler</span>). He gave his name in <span class="t8">The Vanity of Human Wishes, Irene</span>, the <span class="t8">Dictionary</span>, his edition of <span class="t8">Shakespeare</span>, the <span class="t8">Journey to the Western Islands</span>, and the <span class="t8">Lives of the Poets</span>.</p>
<p class="p10">VII.</p>
<p class="p21"><span class="t8">A letter about George Strahan&rsquo;s election to a scholarship at University College, Oxford, and about William Strahan&rsquo;s &lsquo;affair with the University&rsquo;; dated October 24, 1764</span>.[In the possession of Mr. Frederick Barker.]</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I think I have pretty well disposed of my young friend George, who, if you approve of it, will be entered next Monday a Commoner of University College, and will be chosen next day a Scholar of the House. The Scholarship is a trifle, but it gives him a right, upon a vacancy, to a Fellowship of more than sixty pounds a year if he resides, and I suppose of more than forty if he takes a Curacy or small living. The College is almost filled with my friends, and he will be well treated. The Master is informed of the particular state of his education, and thinks, what I think too, that for Greek he must get some private assistance, which a servitour of the College is very well qualified and will be very willing to afford him on very easy terms.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I must desire your opinion of this scheme by the next post, for the opportunity will be lost if we do not now seize it, the Scholarships being necessarily filled up on Tuesday.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I depend on your proposed allowance of a hundred a year, which must the first year be a little enlarged because there are some extraordinary expenses, as</p>
<p class="p24">Caution (which is allowed in his last quarter). . 7 0 0 Thirds. (He that enters upon a room pays two thirds of the furniture that he finds, and receives from his successor two thirds of what he pays; so that if he pays £20 he receives £13 6s. 8d., this perhaps may be) 12 0 0 Fees at entrance, matriculation &amp;c., perhaps 2 0 0 His gown (I think) 2 10 0&nbsp; £ 23 10 0</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;If you send us a Bill for about thirty pounds we shall set out commodiously enough. You should fit him out with cloaths and linen, and let him start fair, and it is the opinion of those whom I consult, that with your hundred a year and the petty scholarship he may live with great ease to himself, and credit to you.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Let me hear as soon as is possible.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;In your affair with the university, I shall not be consulted, but I hear nothing urged against your proposal.</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;I am, Sir,<br/>&lsquo;Your humble servant,<br/>&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Oct. 24, 1764.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;My compliments to Mrs. Strahan.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To Mr. Strahan, Printer, in New Street, Shoe-lane, London.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">My friend, Mr. C. J. Faulkner, Fellow and Tutor of University College, has given me the following extracts from the College records: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Oct. 30-31, 1764. Candidatis examinatis electi sunt Gulielmus Jones et Georgius Strahan in vacuas Exhibitiones Dmi Simonis Benet Baronetti.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Gulielmus Jones is the famous oriental scholar, Sir William Jones, whose portrait adorns the Hall of his ancient College (<span class="t8">ante</span>, ii. 25, n. 2).</p>
<p class="p24">On April 16, 1767, is found the election of &lsquo;Georgium Strahan, sophistam in perpetuum hujus Collegii Socium.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He vacated his fellowship in 1773.</p>
<p class="p24">The value of a Bennet scholarship in 1764 was ten pounds a year, with rooms added, the rent of which was reckoned as equal to two pounds more. A fellowship on the same foundation was worth about twenty pounds, with a yearly dividend added to it that amounted to about thirty pounds. &lsquo;Fines&rsquo; (<span class="t8">ante</span>, iii. 323) and other extra payments might easily raise the value to more than sixty pounds.</p>
<p class="p24">The &lsquo;caution&rsquo; is the sum deposited by an undergraduate with the College Bursar or Steward as a security for the payment of his &lsquo;battells&rsquo; or account. Johnson in 1728 had to pay at Pembroke College the same sum (seven pounds) that George Strahan in 1764 had to pay at University College. <span class="t8">Ante</span>, i. 58, n. 2.</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson wrote four letters to George Strahan, when he was a boy at school, and one letter when he was at College. (See Croker&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Johnson</span>, pp. 129, 130, 161, 168.) In this last letter, dated May 25, 1765, he writes: &lsquo;Do not tire yourself so much with Greek one day as to be afraid of looking on it the next; but give it a certain portion of time, suppose four hours, and pass the rest of the day in Latin or English. I would have you learn French, and take in a literary journal once a month, which will accustom you to various subjects, and inform you what learning is going forward in the world. Do not omit to mingle some lighter books with those of more importance; that which is read <span class="t8">remisso animo</span> is often of great use, and takes great hold of the remembrance. However, take what course you will, if you be diligent you will be a scholar.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">George Strahan attended Johnson on his death-bed, and published the volume called <span class="t8">Prayers and Meditations composed by Samuel Johnson</span>. <span class="t8">Ante</span>, i. 235, n. i; iv. 376, n. 4.</p>
<p class="p24">William Strahan&rsquo;s &lsquo;affair with the University&rsquo; was very likely connected with the lease of the University Printing House. From the &lsquo;Orders of the Delegates of the Press,&rsquo; 1758, I have been permitted to copy the following entry, which bears a date but six days later than that of Johnson&rsquo;s letter.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Tuesday, Oct. 30, 1764. At a meeting of the Delegates of the Press.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Ordered,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;That the following articles be made the foundation of the new lease to be granted of the moiety of the Printing House; that a copy of them be delivered to Mr. Baskett and Mr. Eyre, and that they be desired to give in their respective proposals at a meeting to be held on Tuesday the sixth of November.&rsquo; (P. 41.)</p>
<p class="p24">The chief part of the lease consisted of the privilege to print Bibles and Prayer Books. I conjecture that Strahan had hoped to get a share in the lease.</p>
<p class="p10">VIII.</p>
<p class="p21"><span class="t8">A letter about a cancel in Johnson&rsquo;s &lsquo;Journey to the Western Islands of Scotland&rsquo;, dated Nov. 30</span>, 1774.[In the possession of Messrs. Pearson and Co., 46, Pall Mall.]</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I waited on you this morning having forgotten your new engagement; for this you must not reproach me, for if I had looked upon your present station with malignity I could not have forgotten it. I came to consult you upon a little matter that gives me some uneasiness. In one of the pages there is a severe censure of the clergy of an English Cathedral which I am afraid is just, but I have since recollected that from me it may be thought improper, for the Dean did me a kindness about forty years ago. He is now very old, and I am not young. Reproach can do him no good, and in myself I know not whether it is zeal or wantonness. Can a leaf be cancelled without too much trouble? tell me what I shall do. I have no settled choice, but I would not wish to allow the charge. To cancel it seems the surer side. Determine for me.</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;I am, Sir, Your most humble servant,<br/>&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;<br/>&lsquo;Nov. 30, 1774.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Tell me your mind: if you will cancel it I will write something to fill up the vacuum. Please to direct to the borough.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p26">Mr. Strahan&rsquo;s &lsquo;new engagement&rsquo; was in the House of Commons at Westminster,<br/>to which he had been elected for the first time as member for Malmesbury.<br/>The new Parliament had met on Nov. 29, the day before the date of<br/>Johnson&rsquo;s letter (<span class="t8">Parl. Hist</span>, xviii. 23).</p>
<p class="p24">The leaf that Johnson cancelled contained pages 47, 48 in the first edition of his <span class="t8">Journey to the Western Islands</span>. It corresponds with pages 19-30 in vol. ix. of Johnson&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Works</span> (ed. 1825), beginning with the words &lsquo;could not enter,&rsquo; and ending &lsquo;imperfect constitution.&rsquo; The excision is marked by a ridge of paper, which was left that the revised leaf might be attached to it. Johnson describes how the lead which covered the Cathedrals of Elgin and Aberdeen had been stripped off by the order of the Scottish Council, and shipped to be sold in Holland. He continues:&mdash; &lsquo;Let us not however make too much haste to despise our neighbours. Our own cathedrals are mouldering by unregarded dilapidation. It seems to be part of the despicable philosophy of the time to despise monuments of sacred magnificence, and we are in danger of doing that deliberately, which the Scots did not do but in the unsettled state of an imperfect constitution.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">In the copy of the first edition in the Bodleian Library, which had belonged to Gough the antiquary, there is written in his hand, as a foot-note to &lsquo;neighbours&rsquo;: &lsquo;There is now, as I have heard, a body of men not less decent or virtuous than the Scottish Council, longing to melt the lead of an English Cathedral. What they shall melt, it were just that they should swallow.&rsquo; It can scarcely be doubted that this is the suppressed passage. The English Cathedral to which Johnson refers was, I believe, Lichfield. &lsquo;The roof,&rsquo; says Harwood (History of Lichfield, p. 75), &lsquo;was formerly covered with lead, but now with slate.&rsquo; Addenbroke, who had been Dean since 1745, was, we may assume, very old at the time when Johnson wrote. I had at first thought it not unlikely that it was Dr. Thomas Newton, Dean of St. Paul&rsquo;s and Bishop of Bristol, who was censured. He was a Lichfield man, and was known to Johnson (see <span class="t8">ante</span>, iv. 285, n. 3). He was, however, only seventy years old. I am informed moreover by the Rev. W. Sparrow Simpson, the learned editor of <span class="t8">Documents illustrating the History of St. Paul&rsquo;s</span>, that it is very improbable that at this time the Dean and Chapter of St. Paul&rsquo;s entertained such a thought.</p>
<p class="p24">My friend Mr. C. E. Doble has kindly furnished me with the following curious parallel to Johnson&rsquo;s suppressed wish about the molten lead.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The chappell of our Lady [at Wells], late repayred by Stillington, a place of great reverence and antiquitie, was likewise defaced, and such was their thirst after lead (I would they had drunke it scalding) that they tooke the dead bodies of bishops out of their leaden coffins, and cast abroad the carkases skarce throughly putrified.&rsquo; &mdash; Harington&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Nuga Antiquae</span>, ii. 147 (ed. 1804).</p>
<p class="p24">In the postscript Johnson says &lsquo;Please to direct to the borough.&rsquo; He was staying in Mr. Thrale&rsquo;s town-house in the Borough of Southwark. (See <span class="t8">ante</span>, i, 493.)</p>

<p class="p24">&lsquo;Sir,</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;When we meet we talk, and I know not whether I always recollect what<br/>I thought I had to say.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;You will please to remember that I once asked you to receive an apprentice, who is a scholar, and has always lived in a clergyman&rsquo;s house, but who is mishapen, though I think not so as to hinder him at the case. It will be expected that I should answer his Friend who has hitherto maintained him, whether I can help him to a place. He can give no money, but will be kept in cloaths.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I have another request which it is perhaps not immediately in your power to gratify. I have a presentation to beg for the blue coat hospital. The boy is a non-freeman, and has both his parents living. We have a presentation for a freeman which we can give in exchange. If in your extensive acquaintance you can procure such an exchange, it will be an act of great kindness. Do not let the matter slip out of your mind, for though I try others I know not any body of so much power to do it.</p>

<p class="p27">&lsquo;SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am sorry to see that all the alterations proposed are evidences of timidity. You may be sure that I do [? not] wish to publish, what those for whom I write do not like to have published. But print me half a dozen copies in the original state, and lay them up for me. It concludes well enough as it is.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;When you print it, if you print it, please to frank one to me here, and frank another to Mrs. Aston at Stow Hill, Lichfield.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The changes are not for the better, except where facts were mistaken. The last paragraph was indeed rather contemptuous, there was once more of it which I put out myself.</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;I am Sir, Your humble Servant,<br/>&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;March 1, 1775.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">This letter refers to <span class="t8">Taxation no Tyranny</span>, which was published before March 31, 1775, the date of Boswell&rsquo;s arrival in London (<span class="t8">ante</span>, ii. 311). Boswell says that he had in his possession &lsquo;a few proof leaves of it marked with corrections in Johnson&rsquo;s own hand-writing&rsquo; (ib. p. 313). Johnson, he says,&rsquo; owned to me that it had been revised and curtailed by some of those who were then in power.&rsquo; When Johnson writes &lsquo;when you print it, if you print it,&rsquo; he uses, doubtless, <span class="t8">print</span> in the sense of <span class="t8">striking off copies</span>. The pamphlet was, we may assume, in type before it was revised by &lsquo;those in power.&rsquo; The corrections had been made in the proof-sheets. Johnson asks to have six copies laid by for him in the state in which he had wished to publish it. It seems that the last paragraph had been struck out by the reviser, for Johnson says &lsquo;it was rather contemptuous.&rsquo; He does not think it needful to supply anything in its place, for he says &lsquo;it concludes well enough as it is.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Mr. Strahan had the right, as a member of Parliament, to frank all letters and packets. That is to say, by merely writing his signature on the cover he could pass them through the post free of charge. Johnson, when he wrote to Scotland, used to employ him to frank his letters, &lsquo;that he might have the consequence of appearing a parliament-man among his countrymen&rsquo; (<span class="t8">ante</span>, iii. 364). It was to Oxford that a copy of the pamphlet was to be franked to Johnson. That he was there at the time is shown by a letter from him in Mrs. Piozzi&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Collection</span> (vol. i. p. 212), dated &lsquo;University College, Oxford, March 3, 1775.&rsquo; Writing to her, evidently from Bolt Court, on February 3, he had said: &lsquo;My pamphlet has not gone on at all&rsquo; (ib. i. 211). Mrs. Aston (or rather Miss Aston) is mentioned <span class="t8">ante</span>, ii. 466.</p>

<p class="p21"><span class="t8">A letter about &lsquo;copy&rsquo; and a book by Professor Watson, dated Oct. 14, 1776&rsquo;</span>.[In the possession of Mr. H. Fawcett, of 14, King Street, Covent Garden.]</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I wrote to you about ten days ago, and sent you some copy. You have not written again, that is a sorry trick.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am told that you are printing a Book for Mr. Professor Watson of Saint Andrews, if upon any occasion, I can give any help, or be of any use, as formerly in Dr. Robertson&rsquo;s publication, I hope you will make no scruple to call upon me, for I shall be glad of an opportunity to show that my reception at Saint Andrews has not been forgotten.</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;I am Sir, Your humble Servant,<br/>&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Oct. 14, 1776.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">The&rsquo; copy&rsquo; or MS. that Johnson sent is, I conjecture, <span class="t8">Proposals for the Rev. Mr. Shaw&rsquo;s Analysis of the Scotch Celtick Language</span> (<span class="t8">ante</span>, iii. 107). This is the only acknowledged piece of writing of his during 1776. The book printing for Professor Watson was <span class="t8">History of the Reign of Philip II</span>, which was published by Strahan and Cadell in 1777. This letter is of unusual interest, as showing that Johnson had been of some service as regards one of Robertson&rsquo;s books. It is possible that he read some of the proof-sheets, and helped to get rid of the Scotticisms. &lsquo;Strahan,&rsquo; according to Beattie, &lsquo;had corrected (as he told me himself) the phraseology of both Mr. Hume and Dr. Robertson&rsquo; (<span class="t8">ante</span>, v. 92, n. 3). He is not unlikely, in Robertson&rsquo;s case, to have sought and obtained Johnson&rsquo;s help.</p>

<p class="p21"><span class="t8">The following letter is published in Mr. Alfred Morrison&rsquo;s &lsquo;Collection of Autographs&rsquo;, vol. ii. p. 343.</span></p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To Dr. TAYLOR. Dated London, April 20, 1778.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The quantity of blood taken from you appears to me not sufficient. Thrale was almost lost by the scrupulosity of his physicians, who never bled him copiously till they bled him in despair; he then bled till he fainted, and the stricture or obstruction immediately gave way and from that instant he grew better.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I can now give you no advice but to keep yourself totally quiet and amused with some gentle exercise of the mind. If a suspected letter comes, throw it aside till your health is reestablished; keep easy and cheerful company about you, and never try to think but at those stated and solemn times when the thoughts are summoned to the cares of futurity, the only cares of a rational being.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;As to my own health I think it rather grows better; the convulsions which left me last year at Ashbourne have never returned, and I have by the mercy of God very comfortable nights. Let me know very often how you are till you are quite well.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">This letter, though it is dated 1778, must have been written in 1780. Thrale&rsquo;s first attack was in June, 1779, when he was in &lsquo;extreme danger&rsquo; (<span class="t8">ante</span>, iii. 397, n. 2, 420). Johnson had the remission of the convulsions on June 18, 1779. He recorded on June 18, 1780: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;In the morning of this day last year I perceived the remission of those convulsions in my breast which had distressed me for more than twenty years. I returned thanks at church for the mercy granted me, which has now continued a year.&rsquo; &mdash; <span class="t8">Prayers and Meditations</span>, p. 183.</p>
<p class="p24">Three days later he wrote to Mrs. Thrale: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;It was a twelvemonth last Sunday since the convulsions in my breast left me. I hope I was thankful when I recollected it; by removing that disorder a great improvement was made in the enjoyment of life.&rsquo; &mdash; <span class="t8">Piozzi Letters</span>, ii. 163.

<p class="p24">He was at Ashbourne on June 18, 1779 (<span class="t8">ante</span>, iii. 453).</p>
<p class="p24">On April 20, 1778, the very day of which this letter bears the date, he recorded: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;After a good night, as I am forced to reckon, I rose seasonably…. In reviewing my time from Easter, 1777, I found a very melancholy and shameful blank. So little has been done that days and months are without any trace. My health has, indeed, been very much interrupted. My nights have been commonly not only restless, but painful and fatiguing. ….Some relaxation of my breast has been procured, I think, by opium, which, though it never gives me sleep, frees my breast from spasms.&rsquo; &mdash; <span class="t8">Prayers and Meditations</span>, p. 169.

<p class="p24">&lsquo;Conscious, notwithstanding, that to avoid writing what is <span class="t8">unnecessary</span> is, in these days, no just plea for silence in a biographer, I have some apology to make for having strewed these pages so thinly with the tittle-tattle of anecdote. I am, however, too proud to make this apology to any person but my bookseller, who will be the only real loser by the &lsquo;Those readers, who believe that I do not write immediately under his pay, and who may have gathered from what they have already read, that I am not so passionately enamoured of Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s biographical manner, as to take that for my model, have only to throw these pages aside, and wait till they are new-written by some one of his numerous disciples, who may follow his master&rsquo;s example; and should more anecdote than I furnish him with be wanting (as was the Doctor&rsquo;s case in his life of Mr. Gray), may make amends for it by those acid eructations of vituperative criticism, which are generated by unconcocted taste and intellectual indigestion.&rsquo; &mdash; <span class="t8">Poems by William Whitehead</span>, York, 1788 (vol. iii, p. 128).</p>

Her first husband died insolvent [this is a mistake, see <span class="t8">ante</span>, i. 95, n. 3]; her sons were much disgusted with her for her second marriage; … however, she always retained her affection for them. While they [Mr. and Mrs. Johnson] resided in Gough Square, her son, the officer, knocked at the door, and asked the maid if her mistress was at home. She answered, &ldquo;Yes, Sir, but she is sick in bed.&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;if it&rsquo;s so, tell her that her son Jervis called to know how she did;&rdquo; and was going away. The maid begged she might run up to tell her mistress, and, without attending his answer, left him. Mrs. Johnson, enraptured to hear her son was below, desired the maid to tell him she longed to embrace him. When the maid descended the gentleman was gone, and poor Mrs. Johnson was much agitated by the adventure; it was the only time he ever made an effort to see her. Dr. [Mr.] Johnson did all he could to console his wife, but told Mrs. Williams: &ldquo;Her son is uniformly undutiful; so I conclude, like many other sober men, he might once in his life be drunk, and in that fit nature got the better of his pride.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>

<p class="p24">Boswell says that he does not know &lsquo;at what time, or by what means Johnson had acquired a competent knowledge of Italian.&rsquo; In my note on this I say &lsquo;he had read Petrarch &ldquo;when but a boy.&rdquo;&rsquo; As Petrarch wrote chiefly in Latin, it is quite possible that Johnson did not acquire his knowledge of Italian so early as I had thought.</p>

<p class="p24">(Vol. i, p. 200.)</p>
<p class="p24">Miss Burney records an interesting piece of criticism by Johnson. &lsquo;There are,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;three distinct kinds of judges upon all new authors or productions; the first are those who know no rules, but pronounce entirely from their natural taste and feelings; the second are those who know and judge by rules; and the third are those who know, but are above the rules. These last are those you should wish to satisfy. Next to them rate the natural judges; but ever despise those opinions that are formed by the rules.&rsquo; &mdash; <span class="t8">Mine. D&rsquo;Arblay&rsquo;s Diary</span>, i. 180. Later on she writes:&mdash; &lsquo;The natural feelings of untaught hearers ought never to be slighted; and Dr. Johnson has told me the same a thousand times;&rsquo; ib. ii. 128.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Johnson in the Green Room</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">(Vol. i, p. 201.)</p>
<p class="p24">Mr. Richard Herne Shepherd, in <span class="t8">Watford&rsquo;s Antiquarian</span> for January, 1887, p. 34, asserts that the actual words which Johnson used when he told Garrick that he would no longer frequent his Green Room were indecent; so indecent that Mr. Shepherd can only venture to satisfy those whom he calls students by informing them of them privately. For proof of this charge against the man whose boast it was that &lsquo;obscenity had always been repressed in his company&rsquo; (<span class="t8">ante</span>, iv. 295) he brings forward John Wilkes. The story, indeed, as it is told by Boswell, is not too trustworthy, for he had it through Hume from Garrick. As it reaches Mr. Shepherd it comes from Garrick through Wilkes. Garrick, no doubt, as Johnson says (<span class="t8">ante</span>, v. 391), was, as a companion, &lsquo;restrained by some principle,&rsquo; and had &lsquo;some delicacy of feeling.&rsquo; Nevertheless, in his stories, he was, we may be sure, no more on oath than a man is in lapidary inscriptions (<span class="t8">ante</span>, ii. 407). It is possible that he reported Johnson&rsquo;s very words to Hume, and that Hume did not change them in reporting them to Boswell. Whatever they were, they were spoken in 1749 and published in 1791, when Johnson had been dead six years, Garrick twelve years, and Hume fourteen years. It is idle to dream that they can now be conjecturally emended. But it is worse than idle to bring in as evidence John Wilkes. What entered his ear as purity itself might issue from his mouth as the grossest obscenity. He had no delicacy of feeling. No principle restrained him. When he comes to bear testimony, and aims a shaft at any man&rsquo;s character, the bow that he draws is drawn with the weakness of the hand of a worn-out and shameless profligate.</p>
<p class="p24">Mr. Shepherd quotes an unpublished letter of Boswell to Wilkes, dated Rome, April 22, 1765, to show &lsquo;that the two men had become familiars, not only long before Wilkes&rsquo;s famous meeting with Dr. Johnson was brought about, but before even the friendship of Boswell himself with Johnson had been consolidated.&rsquo; It needs no unpublished letters to show that. It must be known to every attentive reader of Boswell. See <span class="t8">ante</span>, i. 395, and ii. 11.</p>

But you will allow that I may endeavour to make him happy, and at the same time not to be too hard upon myself. I must use you so much with the freedom of a friend as to tell you that with the vivacity which you allowed me I have a melancholy disposition.

<p class="p24">&lsquo;The <span class="t8">Advertisement to Religion and Policy, by Edward Earl of Clarendon</span>, runs as follows: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&ldquo;Henry Viscount Cornbury, who was called up to the House of Peers by the title of Lord Hyde, in the lifetime of his father, Henry Earl of Rochester, by a codicil to his will, dated Aug. 10, 1751, left divers MSS. of his great grandfather, Edward Earl of Clarendon, to Trustees, with a direction that the money to arise from the sale or publication thereof, should be employed as a beginning of a fund for supporting a Manage or Academy for riding and other useful exercises in Oxford; a plan of this sort having been also recommended by Lord Clarendon in his Dialogue on Education. Lord Cornbury dying before his father, this bequest did not take effect. But Catharine, one of the daughters of Henry Earl of Rochester, and late Duchess Dowager of Queensbury, whose property these MSS. became, afterwards by deed gave them, together with all the monies which had arisen or might arise from the sale or publication of them, to [three Trustees] upon trust for the like purposes as those expressed by Lord Hyde in his codicil.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The preface to the <span class="t8">Life of Edward Earl of Clarendon, written by himself</span>., has words to the same effect. (See also <span class="t8">Notes and Queries</span>, Ser. I. x. 185, and xi. 32.)</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;From a letter in <span class="t8">Notes and Queries</span>, Ser. II. x. p. 74, it appears that in 1860 the available sum, in the hands of the Trustees of the Clarendon Bequest, amounted to £10,000. The University no longer needed a riding-school, and the claims of Physical Science were urgent; and in 1872 the announcement was made, that by the liberality of the Clarendon Trustees an additional wing had been added to the University Museum, containing the lecture-rooms and laboratories of the department of Experimental Philosophy.&rsquo; Vol. i. p. 305.</p>

<p class="p24">In <span class="t8">Farm and its Inhabitants</span> (<span class="t8">ante</span>, p. xlii), a further account is given of the controversy between Johnson and Mr. Lloyd the Quaker, on the subject of Barclay&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Apology</span>.</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;Tradition states that, losing his temper, Dr. Johnson threw the volume<br/>on the floor, and put his foot on it, in denunciation of its statements.<br/>The identical volume is now in the possession of G. B. Lloyd, of Edgbaston<br/>Grove.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;At the dinner table he continued the debate in such angry tones, and struck the table so violently that the children were frightened, and desired to escape.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The next morning Dr. Johnson went to the bank [Mr. Lloyd was a banker] and by way of apology called out in his stentorian voice, &ldquo;I say, Lloyd, I&rsquo;m the best theologian, but you are the best Christian.&rsquo;&rdquo; p. 41. It could not have been &lsquo;the next morning&rsquo; that Johnson went to the bank, for he left for Lichfield on the evening of the day of the controversy (<span class="t8">ante</span>, ii. 461). He must have gone in the afternoon, while Boswell was away seeing Mr. Boulton&rsquo;s great works at Soho (ib. p. 459).</p>
<p class="p24">Mr. G. B. Lloyd, the great-grandson of Johnson&rsquo;s host, in a letter written this summer (1886), says: &lsquo;Having spent much of my boyhood with my grandfather in the old house, I have heard him tell the story of the stamping on the broad volume.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Boswell mentions (ib. p. 457) that &lsquo;Mr. and Mrs. Lloyd, like their Majesties, had been blessed with a numerous family of fine children, their numbers being exactly the same.&rsquo; The author of <span class="t8">Farm and its Inhabitants</span> says (p. 46): &lsquo;There is a tradition that when Sampson Lloyd&rsquo;s wife used to feel depressed by the care of such a large family (they had sixteen children) he would say to her, &ldquo;Never mind, the twentieth will be the most welcome.&rdquo;&rsquo; His fifteenth child Catharine married Dr. George Birkbeck, the founder of the Mechanics&rsquo; Institutes (ib. p. 48).</p>
<p class="p24">A story told (p. 50) of one of Mr. Lloyd&rsquo;s sons-in-law, Joseph Biddle, is an instance of that excess of forgetfulness which Johnson called &lsquo;morbid oblivion&rsquo; (<span class="t8">ante</span>, v. 68). &lsquo;He went to pay a call in Leamington. The servant asked him for his name, he could not remember it; in perplexity he went away, when a friend in the street met him and accosted him, &ldquo;How do you do, Mr. Biddle?&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, Biddle, Biddle, Biddle, that&rsquo;s the name,&rdquo; cried he, and rushed off to pay his call.&rsquo;</p>

<p class="p24">&lsquo;This is another thing which I am changed in; that whereas in my younger days I was never tempted to doubt of the Truth of Scripture or Christianity, but all my Doubts and Fears were exercised at home, about my own Sincerity and Interest in Christ &mdash; since then my sorest assaults have been on the other side, and such they were, that had I been void of internal Experience, and the adhesion of Love, and the special help of God, and had not discerned more Reason for my Religion than I did when I was younger, I had certainly apostatized to Infidelity,&rsquo; &amp;c.</p>

<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Oxford in 1782</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">(Vol. iii, p. 13, n. 3.)</p>
<p class="p24">The Rev. C. P. Moritz (<span class="t8">ante</span>, p. liv) gives a curious account of his visit to Oxford. On his way from Dorchester on the evening of a Sunday in June, he had been overtaken by the Rev. Mr. Maud, who seems to have been a Fellow and Tutor of Corpus College, and who was returning from doing duty in his curacy. It was late when they arrived in the town. Moritz, who, as I have said, more than once had found great difficulty in getting a bed, had made up his mind to pass the summer night on a stonebench in the High Street. His comrade would not hear of this, but said that he would take him to an ale-house where &lsquo;it is possible they mayn&rsquo;t be gone to bed, and we may yet find company.&rsquo; This ale-house was the Mitre.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;We went on a few houses further, and then knocked at a door. It was then nearly twelve. They readily let us in; but how great was my astonishment when, on being shown into a room on the left, I saw a great number of clergymen, all with their gowns and bands on, sitting round a large table, each with his pot of beer before him. My travelling companion introduced me to them as a German clergyman, whom he could not sufficiently praise for my correct pronunciation of the Latin, my orthodoxy, and my good walking.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I now saw myself in a moment, as it were, all at once transported into the midst of a company, all apparently very respectable men, but all strangers to me. And it appeared to me extraordinary that I should thus at midnight be in Oxford, in a large company of Oxonian clergy, without well knowing how I had got there. Meanwhile, however, I took all the pains in my power to recommend myself to my company, and in the course of conversation I gave them as good an account as I could of our German universities, neither denying nor concealing that now and then we had riots and disturbances. &ldquo;Oh, we are very unruly here, too,&rdquo; said one of the clergymen, as he took a hearty draught out of his pot of beer, and knocked on the table with his hand. The conversation now became louder, more general, and a little confused. … At last, when morning drew near, Mr. Maud suddenly exclaimed, &ldquo;D-n me, I must read prayers this morning at All Souls!&rdquo; &ldquo;D-n me&rdquo; is an abbreviation of &ldquo;G-d d-n me,&rdquo; which in England does not seem to mean more mischief or harm than any of our or their common expletives in conversation, such as &ldquo;O gemini!&rdquo; or &ldquo;The deuce take me!&rdquo; … I am almost ashamed to own, that next morning, when I awoke, I had got so dreadful a headache from the copious and numerous toasts of my jolly and reverend friends that I could not possibly get up. &mdash; <span class="t8">Travels in England in 1782</span>, by C.

<p class="p24">&lsquo;I remember Dr. Routh, the old President of Magdalen, telling me of an interview and conversation between Dr. Johnson and Dr. Parr, in the course of which the former made use of some expression respecting the latter, which considerably wounded and offended him. &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; he said to Dr. Johnson, &ldquo;you know that what you have just said will be known in four-and-twenty hours over this vast metropolis.&rdquo; Upon which Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s manner altered, his eye became calm, and he put out his hand, and said, &ldquo;Forgive me, Parr, I didn&rsquo;t quite mean it.&rdquo; &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said the President, with an amused and amusing look, &ldquo;<span class="t8">I never could get him to tell me what it was Dr. Johnson had said!</span>&rdquo; He spoke of seeing Dr. Johnson going up the steps into University College, dressed, I think, in a snuff-coloured coat.&rsquo;</p>

<p class="p24">&lsquo;The commonest cause [of suicide] is melancholy, &amp;c.

The next Lord&rsquo;s Day, I cleared and confirmed it, and shewed them that if this were not true, their Infants had no need of Christ, of Baptism, or of Renewing by the Holy Ghost. And I asked them whether they durst say that their Children were saved without a Saviour, and were no Christians, and why they baptized them, with much more to that purpose, and afterwards they were ashamed and as mute as fishes.&rsquo;</p>

Mr. Berkeley said, that as he should reside in his father&rsquo;s house, it was little likely he should break any windows, having never, that he remembered, broke one in his life. He was assured that he <span class="t8">would</span> do it at St. Andrews. On the rising of the session several of the students said, &ldquo;Now for the windows. Come, it is time to set off, let us sally forth!&rdquo; Mr. Berkeley, being called upon, enquired what was to be done? They replied, &ldquo;Why, to break every window in college.&rdquo; &ldquo;For what reason?&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh! no reason; but that it has always been done from time immemorial.&rdquo;&rsquo; The Editor goes on to say that Mr. Berkeley prevailed on them to give up the practice. How poor some of the students were is shown by the following anecdote, told by the College Porter, who had to collect the crowns. &lsquo;I am just come,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;from a poor student indeed. I went for the window <span class="t8">croon</span>; he cried, begged, and prayed not to pay it, saying, &ldquo;he brought but a croon to keep him all the session, and he had spent sixpence of it; so I have got only four and sixpence.&rdquo;&rsquo; His father, a labourer, who owned three cows, &lsquo;had sold one to dress his son for the University, and put the lamented croon in his pocket to purchase coals. All the lower students study by fire-light. He had brought with him a large tub of oatmeal and a pot of salted butter, on which he was to subsist from Oct. 20 until May 20.&rsquo; Berkeley raised &lsquo;a very noble subscription&rsquo; for the poor fellow.</p>
<p class="p24">In another passage (p. cxcviii) it is recorded that Berkeley &lsquo;boasted to his father, &ldquo;Well, Sir, idle as you may think me, I never have once bowed at any Professor&rsquo;s Lecture.&rdquo; An explanation being requested of the word <span class="t8">bowing</span>, it was thus given: &ldquo;Why, if any poor fellow has been a little idle, and is not prepared to speak when called upon by the Professor, he gets up and makes a respectful-bow, and sits down again.&rdquo;&rsquo; Berkeley was a grandson of Bishop Berkeley.</p>

But his philosophy had been formed in the school of Locke, his divinity in that of Limborch and Le Clerc; in a long and laborious life several generations of pupils were taught to think and even to write; his lessons rescued the Academy of Lausanne from Calvinistic prejudice; and he had the rare merit of diffusing a more liberal spirit among the clergy and people of the Pays de Vaud.&rsquo; &mdash; <span class="t8">Memoirs of Edward Gibbon</span>, ed. 1827, i. 66.</p>

I have discovered, though too late to mention in the proper place, that in the first edition the leaf containing pages 167, 168, was really cancelled. In my own copy I noticed between pages 168 and 169 a narrow projecting slip of paper. I found the same in the copy in the British Museum. Mr. Horace Hart, the printer to the University, who has kindly examined my copy, informs me that the leaf was cancelled after the sheets had been stitched together. It was cut out, but an edge was left to which the new one was attached by paste.

<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Shakespeare&rsquo;s popularity</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">(Vol. v, p. 244, n. 2.)</p>
<p class="p24">Gibbon, after describing how he used to attend Voltaire&rsquo;s private theatre at Monrepos in 1757 and 1758, continues: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The habits of pleasure fortified my taste for the French theatre, and that taste has perhaps abated my idolatry for the gigantic genius of Shakespeare, which is inculcated from our infancy as the first duty of an Englishman.&rsquo; &mdash; <span class="t8">Memoirs of Edward Gibbon</span>, ed. 1837, i. 90.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Archibald Campbell</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">(Vol. v, p. 357.)</p>
<p class="p24">Mr. C. E. Doble informs me that in the Bodleian Library &lsquo;there is a characteristic letter of Archibald Campbell in a <span class="t8">Life of Francis Lee</span> in Rawlinson, J., 4to. 2. 197; and also a skeleton life of him in Rawlinson, J., 4to. 5. 301.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Cocoa Tree Club.</span></p>
<p class="p24">(Vol. v, p. 386, n. 1.)</p>
<p class="p26">Gibbon records in his Journal on November 24, 1762, a visit to the Cocoa<br/>Tree Club: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;That respectable body, of which I have the honour of being a member, affords every evening a sight truly English. Twenty or thirty, perhaps, of the first men in the kingdom in point of fashion and fortune, supping at little tables covered with a napkin, in the middle of a coffee-room, upon a bit of cold meat or a sandwich, and drinking a glass of punch. At present we are full of king&rsquo;s counsellors and lords of the bed-chamber, who, having jumped into the ministry, make a very singular medley of their old principles and language with their modern ones.&rsquo; &mdash; <span class="t8">Memoirs of Edward Gibbon</span>, ed. 1827, i. 131.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Johnson&rsquo;s use of the word &lsquo;big&rsquo;</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">(Vol. v, p. 425.)</p>
<p class="p24">On volume i, page 471, Johnson says: &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t, Sir, accustom yourself to use big words for little matters.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Atlas, the Duke of Devonshire&rsquo;s race-horse.</span></p>
<p class="p24">(Vol. v, p. 429.)</p>
<p class="p26">Johnson, in his <span class="t8">Diary of a Journey into North Wales</span>, records on<br/>July 12, 1774: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;At Chatsworth…, Atlas, fifteen hands inch and half.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Mr. Duppa in a note on this, says: &lsquo;A race-horse, which attracted so much of Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s attention, that he said, &ldquo;of all the Duke&rsquo;s possessions I like Atlas best.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Thomas Holcroft, who in childhood wandered far and wide with his father, a pedlar, was at Nottingham during the race-week of the year 1756 or 1757, and saw in its youth the horse which Johnson so much admired in its old age. He says: &lsquo;The great and glorious part which Nottingham held in the annals of racing this year, arose from the prize of the King&rsquo;s plate, which was to be contended for by the two horses which everybody I heard speak considered as undoubtedly the best in England, and perhaps equal to any that had ever been known, Childers alone excepted. Their names were Careless and Atlas…..There was a story in circulation that Atlas, on account of his size and clumsiness, had been banished to the cart-breed; till by some accident, either of playfulness or fright, several of them started together; and his vast advantage in speed happening to be noticed, he was restored to his blood companions…..Alas for the men of Nottingham, Careless was conquered. I forget whether it was at two or three heats, but there was many an empty purse on that night, and many a sorrowful heart.&rsquo; &mdash; <span class="t8">Memoirs of Thomas Holcroft</span>, i. 70.</p>
<p class="p24">Sir Richard Clough.</p>
<p class="p24">(Vol. v, p. 436.)</p>
<p class="p24">There is an interesting note on Sir Richard Clough, the founder of Bâch y Graig, in Professor Rhys&rsquo;s edition of Pennant&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Tours in Wales</span> (vol. ii, p. 137). The Professor writes to me: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Sir Richard Clough&rsquo;s wealth was so great that it became a saying of the people in North Wales that a man who grew very wealthy was or had become a Clough. This has long been forgotten; but it is still said in Welsh, in North Wales, that a very rich man is a regular <span class="t8">clwch</span>, which is pronounced with the guttural spirant, which was then (in the 16th century) sounded in English, just as the English word <span class="t8">draught</span> (of drink) is in Welsh <span class="t8">dracht</span> pronounced nearly as if it were German.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Evan Evans.</span></p>
<p class="p24">(Vol. v, p. 443.)</p>
<p class="p24">Evan Evans, who is described as being &lsquo;incorrigibly addicted to strong drink,&rsquo; was Curate of Llanvair Talyhaern, in Denbighshire, and author of <span class="t8">Some Specimens of the Poetry of Antient Welsh Bards translated into English</span>. London, R. &amp; J. Dodsley, 1764. My friend Mr. Morfill informs me that he remembers to have seen it stated in a manuscript note in a book in the Bodleian, that &lsquo;Evan Evans would have written much more if he had not been so much given up to the bottle.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p26">Gray thus mentions Evan Evans in a letter to Dr. Wharton, written in<br/>July, 1760: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The Welsh Poets are also coming to light. I have seen a discourse in MS. about them (by one Mr. Evans, a clergyman) with specimens of their writings. This is in Latin; and though it don&rsquo;t approach the other [Macpherson], there are fine scraps among it.&rsquo; &mdash; <span class="t8">The Works of Thomas Gray</span>, ed. by the Rev. John Mitford. London, 1858, vol. iii, p. 250.</p>
