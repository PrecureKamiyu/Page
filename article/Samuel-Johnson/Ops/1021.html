<p class="p24">I said, I disliked the custom which some people had of bringing their children into company, because it in a manner forced us to pay foolish compliments to please their parents. JOHNSON. &lsquo;You are right, Sir. We may be excused for not caring much about other people&rsquo;s children, for there are many who care very little about their own children. It may be observed, that men, who from being engaged in business, or from their course of life in whatever way, seldom see their children, do not care much about them. I myself should not have had much fondness for a child of my own.&rsquo; MRS. THRALE. &lsquo;Nay, Sir, how can you talk so?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;At least, I never wished to have a child.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He talked of Lord Lyttelton&rsquo;s extreme anxiety as an authour; observing, that &lsquo;he was thirty years in preparing his History, and that he employed a man to point it for him; as if (laughing) another man could point his sense better than himself.&rsquo; Mr. Murphy said, he understood his history was kept back several years for fear of Smollet. JOHNSON. &lsquo;This seems strange to Murphy and me, who never felt that anxiety, but sent what we wrote to the press, and let it take its chance.&rsquo; MRS. THRALE. &lsquo;The time has been, Sir, when you felt it.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, really, Madam, I do not recollect a time when that was the case.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Thursday, April 11, I dined with him at General Paoli&rsquo;s, in whose house I now resided, and where I had ever afterwards the honour of being entertained with the kindest attention as his constant guest, while I was in London, till I had a house of my own there. I mentioned my having that morning introduced to Mr. Garrick, Count Neni, a Flemish Nobleman of great rank and fortune, to whom Garrick talked of Abel Drugger as A SMALL PART; and related, with pleasant vanity, that a Frenchman who had seen him in one of his low characters, exclaimed, &lsquo;Comment! je ne le crois pas. Ce n&rsquo;est pas Monsieur Garrick, ce Grand Homme!&rsquo; Garrick added, with an appearance of grave recollection, &lsquo;If I were to begin life again, I think I should not play those low characters.&rsquo; Upon which I observed, &lsquo;Sir, you would be in the wrong; for your great excellence is your variety of playing, your representing so well, characters so very different.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Garrick, Sir, was not in earnest in what he said; for, to be sure, his peculiar excellence is his variety; and, perhaps, there is not any one character which has not been as well acted by somebody else, as he could do it.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Why then, Sir, did he talk so?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, to make you answer as you did.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know, Sir; he seemed to dip deep into his mind for the reflection.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;He had not far to dip, Sir: he said the same thing, probably, twenty times before.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Of a nobleman raised at a very early period to high office, he said, &lsquo;His parts, Sir, are pretty well for a Lord; but would not be distinguished in a man who had nothing else but his parts.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">A journey to Italy was still in his thoughts. He said, &lsquo;A man who has not been in Italy, is always conscious of an inferiority, from his not having seen what it is expected a man should see. The grand object of travelling is to see the shores of the Mediterranean. On those shores were the four great Empires of the world; the Assyrian, the Persian, the Grecian, and the Roman. &mdash; All our religion, almost all our law, almost all our arts, almost all that sets us above savages, has come to us from the shores of the Mediterranean.&rsquo; The General observed, that &lsquo;THE MEDITERRANEAN would be a noble subject for a poem.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">We talked of translation. I said, I could not define it, nor could I think of a similitude to illustrate it; but that it appeared to me the translation of poetry could be only imitation. JOHNSON. &lsquo;You may translate books of science exactly. You may also translate history, in so far as it is not embellished with oratory, which is poetical. Poetry, indeed, cannot be translated; and, therefore, it is the poets that preserve languages; for we would not be at the trouble to learn a language, if we could have all that is written in it just as well in a translation. But as the beauties of poetry cannot be preserved in any language except that in which it was originally written, we learn the language.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Goldsmith (he said,) referred every thing to vanity; his virtues, and his vices too, were from that motive. He was not a social man. He never exchanged mind with you.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">We spent the evening at Mr. Hoole&rsquo;s. Mr. Mickle, the excellent translator of The Lusiad, was there. I have preserved little of the conversation of this evening. Dr. Johnson said, &lsquo;Thomson had a true poetical genius, the power of viewing every thing in a poetical light. His fault is such a cloud of words sometimes, that the sense can hardly peep through. Shiels, who compiled Cibber&rsquo;s Lives of the Poets, was one day sitting with me. I took down Thomson, and read aloud a large portion of him, and then asked, &mdash; Is not this fine? Shiels having expressed the highest admiration. Well, Sir, (said I,) I have omitted every other line.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I related a dispute between Goldsmith and Mr. Robert Dodsley, one day when they and I were dining at Tom Davies&rsquo;s, in 1762. Goldsmith asserted, that there was no poetry produced in this age. Dodsley appealed to his own Collection, and maintained, that though you could not find a palace like Dryden&rsquo;s Ode on St. Cecilia&rsquo;s Day, you had villages composed of very pretty houses; and he mentioned particularly The Spleen. JOHNSON. &lsquo;I think Dodsley gave up the question. He and Goldsmith said the same thing; only he said it in a softer manner than Goldsmith did; for he acknowledged that there was no poetry, nothing that towered above the common mark. You may find wit and humour in verse, and yet no poetry. Hudibras has a profusion of these; yet it is not to be reckoned a poem. The Spleen, in Dodsley&rsquo;s Collection, on which you say he chiefly rested, is not poetry.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Does not Gray&rsquo;s poetry, Sir, tower above the common mark?&rsquo; JOHNSON. Yes, Sir; but we must attend to the difference between what men in general cannot do if they would, and what every man may do if he would. Sixteen-string Jack* towered above the common mark.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Then, Sir, what is poetry?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, it is much easier to say what it is not. We all KNOW what light is; but it is not easy to TELL what it is.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* A noted highwayman, who after having been several times</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tried and acquitted, was at last hanged.&nbsp; He was remarkable</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for foppery in his dress, and particularly for wearing a</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bunch of sixteen strings at the knees of his breeches.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash; BOSWELL.</p>
<p class="p24">On Friday, April 12, I dined with him at our friend Tom Davies&rsquo;s. He reminded Dr. Johnson of Mr. Murphy&rsquo;s having paid him the highest compliment that ever was paid to a layman, by asking his pardon for repeating some oaths in the course of telling a story.</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson and I supt this evening at the Crown and Anchor tavern, in company with Sir Joshua Reynolds, Mr. Langton, Mr. Nairne, now one of the Scotch Judges, with the title of Lord Dunsinan, and my very worthy friend, Sir William Forbes, of Pitsligo.</p>
<p class="p24">We discussed the question whether drinking improved conversation and benevolence. Sir Joshua maintained it did. JOHNSON. &lsquo;No, Sir: before dinner men meet with great inequality of understanding; and those who are conscious of their inferiority, have the modesty not to talk. When they have drunk wine, every man feels himself happy, and loses that modesty, and grows impudent and vociferous: but he is not improved; he is only not sensible of his defects.&rsquo; Sir Joshua said the Doctor was talking of the effects of excess in wine; but that a moderate glass enlivened the mind, by giving a proper circulation to the blood. &lsquo;I am (said he,) in very good spirits, when I get up in the morning. By dinner-time I am exhausted; wine puts me in the same state as when I got up; and I am sure that moderate drinking makes people talk better.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;No, Sir; wine gives not light, gay, ideal hilarity; but tumultuous, noisy, clamorous merriment. I have heard none of those drunken, &mdash; nay, drunken is a coarse word, &mdash; none of those VINOUS flights.&rsquo; SIR JOSHUA. &lsquo;Because you have sat by, quite sober, and felt an envy of the happiness of those who were drinking.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Perhaps, contempt. &mdash; And, Sir, it is not necessary to be drunk one&rsquo;s self, to relish the wit of drunkenness. Do we not judge of the drunken wit, of the dialogue between Iago and Cassio, the most excellent in its kind, when we are quite sober? Wit is wit, by whatever means it is produced; and, if good, will appear so at all times. I admit that the spirits are raised by drinking, as by the common participation of any pleasure: cock-fighting, or bear-baiting, will raise the spirits of a company, as drinking does, though surely they will not improve conversation. I also admit, that there are some sluggish men who are improved by drinking; as there are fruits which are not good till they are rotten. There are such men, but they are medlars. I indeed allow that there have been a very few men of talents who were improved by drinking; but I maintain that I am right as to the effects of drinking in general: and let it be considered, that there is no position, however false in its universality, which is not true of some particular man.&rsquo; Sir William Forbes said, &lsquo;Might not a man warmed with wine be like a bottle of beer, which is made brisker by being set before the fire?&rsquo;&mdash; &lsquo;Nay, (said Johnson, laughing,) I cannot answer that: that is too much for me.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I observed, that wine did some people harm, by inflaming, confusing, and irritating their minds; but that the experience of mankind had declared in favour of moderate drinking. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, I do not say it is wrong to produce self complacency by drinking; I only deny that it improves the mind. When I drank wine, I scorned to drink it when in company. I have drunk many a bottle by myself; in the first place, because I had need of it to raise my spirits; in the second place, because I would have nobody to witness its effects upon me.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He told us, &lsquo;almost all his Ramblers were written just as they were wanted for the press; that he sent a certain portion of the copy of an essay, and wrote the remainder, while the former part of it was printing. When it was wanted, and he had fairly sat down to it, he was sure it would be done.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He said, that for general improvement, a man should read whatever his immediate inclination prompts him to; though, to be sure, if a man has a science to learn, he must regularly and resolutely advance. He added, &lsquo;what we read with inclination makes a much stronger impression. If we read without inclination, half the mind is employed in fixing the attention; so there is but one half to be employed on what we read.&rsquo; He told us, he read Fielding&rsquo;s Amelia through without stopping. He said, &lsquo;if a man begins to read in the middle of a book, and feels an inclination to go on, let him not quit it, to go to the beginning. He may perhaps not feel again the inclination.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Soon after this day, he went to Bath with Mr. and Mrs. Thrale. I had never seen that beautiful city, and wished to take the opportunity of visiting it, while Johnson was there.</p>
<p class="p24">On the 26th of April, I went to Bath; and on my arrival at the Pelican inn, found lying for me an obliging invitation from Mr. and Mrs. Thrale, by whom I was agreeably entertained almost constantly during my stay. They were gone to the rooms; but there was a kind note from Dr. Johnson, that he should sit at home all the evening. I went to him directly, and before Mr. and Mrs. Thrale returned, we had by ourselves some hours of tea-drinking and talk.</p>
<p class="p24">I shall group together such of his sayings as I preserved during the few days that I was at Bath.</p>
<p class="p24">It having been mentioned, I know not with what truth, that a certain female political writer, whose doctrines he disliked, had of late become very fond of dress, sat hours together at her toilet, and even put on rouge: &mdash; Johnson. &lsquo;She is better employed at her toilet, than using her pen. It is better she should be reddening her own cheeks, than blackening other people&rsquo;s characters.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He would not allow me to praise a lady then at Bath; observing, &lsquo;She does not gain upon me, Sir; I think her empty-headed.&rsquo; He was, indeed, a stern critick upon characters and manners. Even Mrs. Thrale did not escape his friendly animadversion at times. When he and I were one day endeavouring to ascertain, article by article, how one of our friends could possibly spend as much money in his family as he told us he did, she interrupted us by a lively extravagant sally, on the expence of clothing his children, describing it in a very ludicrous and fanciful manner. Johnson looked a little angry, and said, &lsquo;Nay, Madam, when you are declaiming, declaim; and when you are calculating, calculate.&rsquo; At another time, when she said, perhaps affectedly, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t like to fly.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;With YOUR wings, Madam, you MUST fly: but have a care, there are CLIPPERS abroad.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Monday, April 29, he and I made an excursion to Bristol, where I was entertained with seeing him enquire upon the spot, into the authenticity of &lsquo;Rowley&rsquo;s Poetry,&rsquo; as I had seen him enquire upon the spot into the authenticity of &lsquo;Ossian&rsquo;s Poetry.&rsquo; George Catcot, the pewterer, who was as zealous for Rowley, as Dr. Hugh Blair was for Ossian, (I trust my Reverend friend will excuse the comparison,) attended us at our inn, and with a triumphant air of lively simplicity called out, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll make Dr. Johnson a convert.&rsquo; Dr. Johnson, at his desire, read aloud some of Chatterton&rsquo;s fabricated verses, while Catcot stood at the back of his chair, moving himself like a pendulum, and beating time with his feet, and now and then looking into Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s face, wondering that he was not yet convinced. We called on Mr. Barret, the surgeon, and saw some of the ORIGINALS as they were called, which were executed very artificially; but from a careful inspection of them, and a consideration of the circumstances with which they were attended, we were quite satisfied of the imposture, which, indeed, has been clearly demonstrated from internal evidence, by several able criticks.</p>
<p class="p24">Honest Catcot seemed to pay no attention whatever to any objections, but insisted, as an end of all controversy, that we should go with him to the tower of the church of St. Mary, Redcliff, and VIEW WITH OUR OWN EYES the ancient chest in which the manuscripts were found. To this, Dr. Johnson good-naturedly agreed; and though troubled with a shortness of breathing, laboured up a long flight of steps, till we came to the place where the wonderous chest stood. &lsquo;THERE, (said Cateot, with a bouncing confident credulity,) THERE is the very chest itself.&rsquo; After this OCULAR DEMONSTRATION, there was no more to be said. He brought to my recollection a Scotch Highlander, a man of learning too, and who had seen the world, attesting, and at the same time giving his reasons for the authenticity of Fingal:&mdash; &lsquo;I have heard all that poem when I was young.&rsquo;&mdash; &lsquo;Have you, Sir? Pray what have you heard?&rsquo;&mdash; &lsquo;I have heard Ossian, Oscar, and EVERY ONE OF THEM.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson said of Chatterton, &lsquo;This is the most extraordinary young man that has encountered my knowledge. It is wonderful how the whelp has written such things.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">We were by no means pleased with our inn at Bristol. &lsquo;Let us see now, (said I,) how we should describe it.&rsquo; Johnson was ready with his raillery. &lsquo;Describe it, Sir? &mdash; Why, it was so bad that Boswell wished to be in Scotland!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">After Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s return to London, I was several times with him at his house, where I occasionally slept, in the room that had been assigned to me. I dined with him at Dr. Taylor&rsquo;s, at General Oglethorpe&rsquo;s, and at General Paoli&rsquo;s. To avoid a tedious minuteness, I shall group together what I have preserved of his conversation during this period also, without specifying each scene where it passed, except one, which will be found so remarkable as certainly to deserve a very particular relation.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Garrick (he observed,) does not play the part of Archer in The Beaux Stratagem well. The gentleman should break out through the footman, which is not the case as he does it.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;That man is never happy for the present is so true, that all his relief from unhappiness is only forgetting himself for a little while. Life is a progress from want to want, not from enjoyment to enjoyment.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Lord Chesterfield&rsquo;s Letters to his Son, I think, might be made a very pretty book. Take out the immorality, and it should be put into the hands of every young gentleman. An elegant manner and easiness of behaviour are acquired gradually and imperceptibly. No man can say &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be genteel.&rdquo; There are ten genteel women for one genteel man, because they are more restrained. A man without some degree of restraint is insufferable; but we are all less restrained than women. Were a woman sitting in company to put out her legs before her as most men do, we should be tempted to kick them in.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">No man was a more attentive and nice observer of behaviour in those in whose company he happened to be, than Johnson; or, however strange it may seem to many, had a higher estimation of its refinements. Lord Eliot informs me, that one day when Johnson and he were at dinner at a gentleman&rsquo;s house in London, upon Lord Chesterfield&rsquo;s Letters being mentioned, Johnson surprized the company by this sentence: &lsquo;Every man of any education would rather be called a rascal, than accused of deficiency in THE GRACES.&rsquo; Mr. Gibbon, who was present, turned to a lady who knew Johnson well, and lived much with him, and in his quaint manner, tapping his box, addressed her thus: &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you think, Madam, (looking towards Johnson,) that among ALL your acquaintance, you could find ONE exception?&rsquo; The lady smiled, and seemed to acquiesce.</p>
<p class="p24">The uncommon vivacity of General Oglethorpe&rsquo;s mind, and variety of knowledge, having sometimes made his conversation seem too desultory, Johnson observed, &lsquo;Oglethorpe, Sir, never COMPLETES what he has to say.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He on the same account made a similar remark on Patrick Lord Elibank: &lsquo;Sir, there is nothing CONCLUSIVE in his talk.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">When I complained of having dined at a splendid table without hearing one sentence of conversation worthy of being remembered, he said, &lsquo;Sir, there seldom is any such conversation.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Why then meet at table?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, to eat and drink together, and to promote kindness; and, Sir, this is better done when there is no solid conversation; for when there is, people differ in opinion, and get into bad humour, or some of the company who are not capable of such conversation, are left out, and feel themselves uneasy. It was for this reason, Sir Robert Walpole said, he always talked bawdy at his table, because in that all could join.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Being irritated by hearing a gentleman* ask Mr. Levett a variety of questions concerning him, when he was sitting by, he broke out, &lsquo;Sir, you have but two topicks, yourself and me. I am sick of both.&rsquo; &lsquo;A man, (said he,) should not talk of himself, nor much of any particular person. He should take care not to be made a proverb; and, therefore, should avoid having any one topick of which people can say, &ldquo;We shall hear him upon it.&rdquo; There was a Dr. Oldfield, who was always talking of the Duke of Marlborough. He came into a coffee-house one day, and told that his Grace had spoken in the House of Lords for half an hour. &ldquo;Did he indeed speak for half an hour?&rdquo; (said Belehier, the surgeon,)&mdash; &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;&mdash; &ldquo;And what did he say of Dr. Oldfield?&rdquo;&mdash; &ldquo;Nothing&rdquo;&mdash; &ldquo;Why then, Sir, he was very ungrateful; for Dr. Oldfield could not have spoken for a quarter of an hour, without saying something of him.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Most likely Boswell himself. &mdash; HILL.</p>
<p class="p24">I am now to record a very curious incident in Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s Life, which fell under my own observation; of which pars magna fui, and which I am persuaded will, with the liberal-minded, be much to his credit.</p>
<p class="p24">My desire of being acquainted with celebrated men of every description, had made me, much about the same time, obtain an introduction to Dr. Samuel Johnson and to John Wilkes, Esq. Two men more different could perhaps not be selected out of all mankind. They had even attacked one another with some asperity in their writings; yet I lived in habits of friendship with both. I could fully relish the excellence of each; for I have ever delighted in that intellectual chymistry, which can separate good qualities from evil in the same person.</p>
<p class="p24">Sir John Pringle, &lsquo;mine own friend and my Father&rsquo;s friend,&rsquo; between whom and Dr. Johnson I in vain wished to establish an acquaintance, as I respected and lived in intimacy with both of them, observed to me once, very ingeniously, &lsquo;It is not in friendship as in mathematicks, where two things, each equal to a third, are equal between themselves. You agree with Johnson as a middle quality, and you agree with me as a middle quality; but Johnson and I should not agree.&rsquo; Sir John was not sufficiently flexible; so I desisted; knowing, indeed, that the repulsion was equally strong on the part of Johnson; who, I know not from what cause, unless his being a Scotchman, had formed a very erroneous opinion of Sir John. But I conceived an irresistible wish, if possible, to bring Dr. Johnson and Mr. Wilkes together. How to manage it, was a nice and difficult matter.</p>
<p class="p24">My worthy booksellers and friends, Messieurs Dilly in the Poultry, at whose hospitable and well-covered table I have seen a greater number of literary men, than at any other, except that of Sir Joshua Reynolds, had invited me to meet Mr. Wilkes and some more gentlemen on Wednesday, May 15. &lsquo;Pray (said I,) let us have Dr. Johnson.&rsquo;&mdash; &lsquo;What with Mr. Wilkes? not for the world, (said Mr. Edward Dilly:) Dr. Johnson would never forgive me.&rsquo;&mdash; &lsquo;Come, (said I,) if you&rsquo;ll let me negotiate for you, I will be answerable that all shall go well.&rsquo; DILLY. &lsquo;Nay, if you will take it upon you, I am sure I shall be very happy to see them both here.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Notwithstanding the high veneration which I entertained for Dr. Johnson, I was sensible that he was sometimes a little actuated by the spirit of contradiction, and by means of that I hoped I should gain my point. I was persuaded that if I had come upon him with a direct proposal, &lsquo;Sir, will you dine in company with Jack Wilkes?&rsquo; he would have flown into a passion, and would probably have answered, &lsquo;Dine with Jack Wilkes, Sir! I&rsquo;d as soon dine with Jack Ketch.&rsquo; I therefore, while we were sitting quietly by ourselves at his house in an evening, took occasion to open my plan thus:&mdash; &lsquo;Mr. Dilly, Sir, sends his respectful compliments to you, and would be happy if you would do him the honour to dine with him on Wednesday next along with me, as I must soon go to Scotland.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, I am obliged to Mr. Dilly. I will wait upon him&mdash; &lsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Provided, Sir, I suppose, that the company which he is to have, is agreeable to you.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;What do you mean, Sir? What do you take me for? Do you think I am so ignorant of the world as to imagine that I am to prescribe to a gentleman what company he is to have at his table?&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;I beg your pardon, Sir, for wishing to prevent you from meeting people whom you might not like. Perhaps he may have some of what he calls his patriotick friends with him.&rsquo; Johnson. &lsquo;Well, Sir, and what then? What care I for his PATRIOTICK FRIENDS? Poh!&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;I should not be surprized to find Jack Wilkes there.&rsquo; Johnson. &lsquo;And if Jack Wilkes SHOULD be there, what is that to ME, Sir? My dear friend, let us have no more of this. I am sorry to be angry with you; but really it is treating me strangely to talk to me as if I could not meet any company whatever, occasionally.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Pray forgive me, Sir: I meant well. But you shall meet whoever comes, for me.&rsquo; Thus I secured him, and told Dilly that he would find him very well pleased to be one of his guests on the day appointed.</p>
<p class="p24">Upon the much-expected Wednesday, I called on him about half an hour before dinner, as I often did when we were to dine out together, to see that he was ready in time, and to accompany him. I found him buffeting his books, as upon a former occasion, covered with dust, and making no preparation for going abroad. &lsquo;How is this, Sir? (said I.) Don&rsquo;t you recollect that you are to dine at Mr. Dilly&rsquo;s?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, I did not think of going to Dilly&rsquo;s: it went out of my head. I have ordered dinner at home with Mrs. Williams.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;But, my dear Sir, you know you were engaged to Mr. Dilly, and I told him so. He will expect you, and will be much disappointed if you don&rsquo;t come.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;You must talk to Mrs. Williams about this.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Here was a sad dilemma. I feared that what I was so confident I had secured would yet be frustrated. He had accustomed himself to shew Mrs. Williams such a degree of humane attention, as frequently imposed some restraint upon him; and I knew that if she should be obstinate, he would not stir. I hastened down stairs to the blind lady&rsquo;s room, and told her I was in great uneasiness, for Dr. Johnson had engaged to me to dine this day at Mr. Dilly&rsquo;s, but that he had told me he had forgotten his engagement, and had ordered dinner at home. &lsquo;Yes, Sir, (said she, pretty peevishly,) Dr. Johnson is to dine at home.&rsquo;&mdash; &lsquo;Madam, (said I,) his respect for you is such, that I know he will not leave you unless you absolutely desire it. But as you have so much of his company, I hope you will be good enough to forego it for a day; as Mr. Dilly is a very worthy man, has frequently had agreeable parties at his house for Dr. Johnson, and will be vexed if the Doctor neglects him to-day. And then, Madam, be pleased to consider my situation; I carried the message, and I assured Mr. Dilly that Dr. Johnson was to come, and no doubt he has made a dinner, and invited a company, and boasted of the honour he expected to have. I shall be quite disgraced if the Doctor is not there.&rsquo; She gradually softened to my solicitations, which were certainly as earnest as most entreaties to ladies upon any occasion, and was graciously pleased to empower me to tell Dr. Johnson, &lsquo;That all things considered, she thought he should certainly go.&rsquo; I flew back to him, still in dust, and careless of what should be the event, &lsquo;indifferent in his choice to go or stay;&rsquo; but as soon as I had announced to him Mrs. Williams&rsquo; consent, he roared, &lsquo;Frank, a clean shirt,&rsquo; and was very soon drest. When I had him fairly seated in a hackney-coach with me, I exulted as much as a fortune-hunter who has got an heiress into a post-chaise with him to set out for Gretna-Green.</p>
<p class="p24">When we entered Mr. Dilly&rsquo;s drawing room, he found himself in the midst of a company he did not know. I kept myself snug and silent, watching how he would conduct himself. I observed him whispering to Mr. Dilly, &lsquo;Who is that gentleman, Sir?&rsquo;&mdash; &lsquo;Mr. Arthur Lee.&rsquo; &mdash; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Too, too, too,&rsquo; (under his breath,) which was one of his habitual mutterings. Mr. Arthur Lee could not but be very obnoxious to Johnson, for he was not only a PATRIOT but an AMERICAN. He was afterwards minister from the United States at the court of Madrid. &lsquo;And who is the gentleman in lace?&rsquo;&mdash; &lsquo;Mr. Wilkes, Sir.&rsquo; This information confounded him still more; he had some difficulty to restrain himself, and taking up a book, sat down upon a window-seat and read, or at least kept his eye upon it intently for some time, till he composed himself. His feelings, I dare say, were aukward enough. But he no doubt recollected his having rated me for supposing that he could be at all disconcerted by any company, and he, therefore, resolutely set himself to behave quite as an easy man of the world, who could adapt himself at once to the disposition and manners of those whom he might chance to meet.</p>
<p class="p24">The cheering sound of &lsquo;Dinner is upon the table,&rsquo; dissolved his reverie, and we ALL sat down without any symptom of ill humour. There were present, beside Mr. Wilkes, and Mr. Arthur Lee, who was an old companion of mine when he studied physick at Edinburgh, Mr. (now Sir John) Miller, Dr. Lettsom, and Mr. Slater the druggist. Mr. Wilkes placed himself next to Dr. Johnson, and behaved to him with so much attention and politeness, that he gained upon him insensibly. No man eat more heartily than Johnson, or loved better what was nice and delicate. Mr. Wilkes was very assiduous in helping him to some fine veal. &lsquo;Pray give me leave, Sir: &mdash; It is better here &mdash; A little of the brown &mdash; Some fat, Sir &mdash; A little of the stuffing &mdash; Some gravy &mdash; Let me have the pleasure of giving you some butter &mdash; Allow me to recommend a squeeze of this orange; &mdash; or the lemon, perhaps, may have more zest.&rsquo;&mdash; &lsquo;Sir, Sir, I am obliged to you, Sir,&rsquo; cried Johnson, bowing, and turning his head to him with a look for some time of &lsquo;surly virtue,&rsquo; but, in a short while, of complacency.</p>
<p class="p24">Foote being mentioned, Johnson said, &lsquo;He is not a good mimick.&rsquo; One of the company added, &lsquo;A merry Andrew, a buffoon.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;But he has wit too, and is not deficient in ideas, or in fertility and variety of imagery, and not empty of reading; he has knowledge enough to fill up his part. One species of wit he has in an eminent degree, that of escape. You drive him into a corner with both hands; but he&rsquo;s gone, Sir, when you think you have got him &mdash; like an animal that jumps over your head. Then he has a great range for wit; he never lets truth stand between him and a jest, and he is sometimes mighty coarse. Garrick is under many restraints from which Foote is free.&rsquo; WILKES. &lsquo;Garrick&rsquo;s wit is more like Lord Chesterfield&rsquo;s.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;The first time I was in company with Foote was at Fitzherbert&rsquo;s. Having no good opinion of the fellow, I was resolved not to be pleased; and it is very difficult to please a man against his will. I went on eating my dinner pretty sullenly, affecting not to mind him. But the dog was so very comical, that I was obliged to lay down my knife and fork, throw myself back upon my chair, and fairly laugh it out. No, Sir, he was irresistible. He upon one occasion experienced, in an extraordinary degree, the efficacy of his powers of entertaining. Amongst the many and various modes which he tried of getting money, he became a partner with a small-beer brewer, and he was to have a share of the profits for procuring customers amongst his numerous acquaintance. Fitzherbert was one who took his small-beer; but it was so bad that the servants resolved not to drink it. They were at some loss how to notify their resolution, being afraid of offending their master, who they knew liked Foote much as a companion. At last they fixed upon a little black boy, who was rather a favourite, to be their deputy, and deliver their remonstrance; and having invested him with the whole authority of the kitchen, he was to inform Mr. Fitzherbert, in all their names, upon a certain day, that they would drink Foote&rsquo;s small-beer no longer. On that day Foote happened to dine at Fitzherbert&rsquo;s, and this boy served at table; he was so delighted with Foote&rsquo;s stories, and merriment, and grimace, that when he went down stairs, he told them, &ldquo;This is the finest man I have ever seen. I will not deliver your message. I will drink his small-beer.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Somebody observed that Garrick could not have done this. WILKES. &lsquo;Garrick would have made the small-beer still smaller. He is now leaving the stage; but he will play Scrub all his life.&rsquo; I knew that Johnson would let nobody attack Garrick but himself, as Garrick once said to me, and I had heard him praise his liberality; so to bring out his commendation of his celebrated pupil, I said, loudly, &lsquo;I have heard Garrick is liberal.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Yes, Sir, I know that Garrick has given away more money than any man in England that I am acquainted with, and that not from ostentatious views. Garrick was very poor when he began life; so when he came to have money, he probably was very unskilful in giving away, and saved when he should not. But Garrick began to be liberal as soon as he could; and I am of opinion, the reputation of avarice which he has had, has been very lucky for him, and prevented his having many enemies. You despise a man for avarice, but do not hate him. Garrick might have been much better attacked for living with more splendour than is suitable to a player: if they had had the wit to have assaulted him in that quarter, they might have galled him more. But they have kept clamouring about his avarice, which has rescued him from much obloquy and envy.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Talking of the great difficulty of obtaining authentick information for biography, Johnson told us, &lsquo;When I was a young fellow I wanted to write the Life of Dryden, and in order to get materials, I applied to the only two persons then alive who had seen him; these were old Swinney, and old Cibber. Swinney&rsquo;s information was no more than this, &ldquo;That at Will&rsquo;s coffee-house Dryden had a particular chair for himself, which was set by the fire in winter, and was then called his winter-chair; and that it was carried out for him to the balcony in summer, and was then called his summer-chair.&rdquo; Cibber could tell no more but &ldquo;That he remembered him a decent old man, arbiter of critical disputes at Will&rsquo;s.&rdquo; You are to consider that Cibber was then at a great distance from Dryden, had perhaps one leg only in the room, and durst not draw in the other.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Yet Cibber was a man of observation?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;I think not.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;You will allow his Apology to be well done.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Very well done, to be sure, Sir. That book is a striking proof of the justice of Pope&rsquo;s remark:</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Each might his several province well command,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would all but stoop to what they understand.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">BOSWELL. &lsquo;And his plays are good.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Yes; but that was his trade; l&rsquo;esprit du corps: he had been all his life among players and play-writers. I wondered that he had so little to say in conversation, for he had kept the best company, and learnt all that can be got by the ear. He abused Pindar to me, and then shewed me an Ode of his own, with an absurd couplet, making a linnet soar on an eagle&rsquo;s wing. I told him that when the ancients made a simile, they always made it like something real.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Mr. Wilkes remarked, that &lsquo;among all the bold flights of Shakspeare&rsquo;s imagination, the boldest was making Birnamwood march to Dunsinane; creating a wood where there never was a shrub; a wood in Scotland! ha! ha! ha!&rsquo; And he also observed, that &lsquo;the clannish slavery of the Highlands of Scotland was the single exception to Milton&rsquo;s remark of &ldquo;The Mountain Nymph, sweet Liberty,&rdquo; being worshipped in all hilly countries.&rsquo;&mdash; &lsquo;When I was at Inverary (said he,) on a visit to my old friend, Archibald, Duke of Argyle, his dependents congratulated me on being such a favourite of his Grace. I said, &ldquo;It is then, gentlemen, truely lucky for me; for if I had displeased the Duke, and he had wished it, there is not a Campbell among you but would have been ready to bring John Wilkes&rsquo;s head to him in a charger. It would have been only,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Off with his head! So much for Aylesbury.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I was then member for Aylesbury.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Mr. Arthur Lee mentioned some Scotch who had taken possession of a barren part of America, and wondered why they should choose it. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, all barrenness is comparative. The SCOTCH would not know it to be barren.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Come, come, he is flattering the English. You have now been in Scotland, Sir, and say if you did not see meat and drink enough there.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why yes, Sir; meat and drink enough to give the enhabitants sufficient strength to run away from home.&rsquo; All these quick and lively sallies were said sportively, quite in jest, and with a smile, which showed that he meant only wit. Upon this topick he and Mr. Wilkes could perfectly assimilate; here was a bond of union between them, and I was conscious that as both of them had visited Caledonia, both were fully satisfied of the strange narrow ignorance of those who imagine that it is a land of famine. But they amused themselves with persevering in the old jokes. When I claimed a superiority for Scotland over England in one respect, that no man can be arrested there for a debt merely because another swears it against him; but there must first be the judgement of a court of law ascertaining its justice; and that a seizure of the person, before judgement is obtained, can take place only, if his creditor should swear that he is about to fly from the country, or, as it is technically expressed, is in meditatione fugoe: WILKES. &lsquo;That, I should think, may be safely sworn of all the Scotch nation.&rsquo; JOHNSON. (to Mr. Wilkes,) &lsquo;You must know, Sir, I lately took my friend Boswell and shewed him genuine civilised life in an English provincial town. I turned him loose at Lichfield, my native city, that he might see for once real civility: for you know he lives among savages in Scotland, and among rakes in London.&rsquo; WILKES. &lsquo;Except when he is with grave, sober, decent people like you and me.&rsquo; JOHNSON. (smiling,) &lsquo;And we ashamed of him.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">They were quite frank and easy. Johnson told the story of his asking Mrs. Macaulay to allow her footman to sit down with them, to prove the ridiculousness of the argument for the equality of mankind; and he said to me afterwards, with a nod of satisfaction, &lsquo;You saw Mr. Wilkes acquiesced.&rsquo; Wilkes talked with all imaginable freedom of the ludicrous title given to the Attorney-General, Diabolus Regis; adding, &lsquo;I have reason to know something about that officer; for I was prosecuted for a libel.&rsquo; Johnson, who many people would have supposed must have been furiously angry at hearing this talked of so lightly, said not a word. He was now, INDEED, &lsquo;a good-humoured fellow.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">After dinner we had an accession of Mrs. Knowles, the Quaker lady, well known for her various talents, and of Mr. Alderman Lee. Amidst some patriotick groans, somebody (I think the Alderman) said, &lsquo;Poor old England is lost.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, it is not so much to be lamented that Old England is lost, as that the Scotch have found it.&rsquo; WILKES. &lsquo;Had Lord Bute governed Scotland only, I should not have taken the trouble to write his eulogy, and dedicate Mortimer to him.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Mr. Wilkes held a candle to shew a fine print of a beautiful female figure which hung in the room, and pointed out the elegant contour of the bosom with the finger of an arch connoisseur. He afterwards, in a conversation with me, waggishly insisted, that all the time Johnson shewed visible signs of a fervent admiration of the corresponding charms of the fair Quaker.</p>
<p class="p24">This record, though by no means so perfect as I could wish, will serve to give a notion of a very curious interview, which was not only pleasing at the time, but had the agreeable and benignant effect of reconciling any animosity, and sweetening any acidity, which in the various bustle of political contest, had been produced in the minds of two men, who though widely different, had so many things in common &mdash; classical learning, modern literature, wit, and humour, and ready repartee &mdash; that it would have been much to be regretted if they had been for ever at a distance from each other.</p>
<p class="p24">Mr. Burke gave me much credit for this successful NEGOCIATION; and pleasantly said, that &lsquo;there was nothing to equal it in the whole history of the Corps Diplomatique.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I attended Dr. Johnson home, and had the satisfaction to hear him tell Mrs. Williams how much he had been pleased with Mr. Wilkes&rsquo;s company, and what an agreeable day he had passed.</p>
<p class="p24">I talked a good deal to him of the celebrated Margaret Caroline Rudd, whom I had visited, induced by the fame of her talents, address, and irresistible power of fascination. To a lady who disapproved of my visiting her, he said on a former occasion, &lsquo;Nay, Madam, Boswell is in the right; I should have visited her myself, were it not that they have now a trick of putting every thing into the news-papers.&rsquo; This evening he exclaimed, &lsquo;I envy him his acquaintance with Mrs. Rudd.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On the evening of the next day I took leave of him, being to set out for Scotland. I thanked him with great warmth for all his kindness. &lsquo;Sir, (said he,) you are very welcome. Nobody repays it with more.</p>
<p class="p24">The following letters concerning an Epitaph which he wrote for the monument of Dr. Goldsmith, in Westminster-Abbey, afford at once a proof of his unaffected modesty, his carelessness as to his own writings, and of the great respect which he entertained for the taste and judgement of the excellent and eminent person to whom they are addressed:</p>
<p class="p24">TO SIR JOSHUA REYNOLDS.</p>
<p class="p24">DEAR SIR, &mdash; I have been kept away from you, I know not well how, and of these vexatious hindrances I know not when there will be an end. I therefore send you the poor dear Doctor&rsquo;s epitaph. Read it first yourself; and if you then think it right, shew it to the Club. I am, you know, willing to be corrected. If you think any thing much amiss, keep it to yourself, till we come together. I have sent two copies, but prefer the card. The dates must be settled by Dr. Percy. I am, Sir, your most humble servant,</p>

<p class="p24">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">It was, I think, after I had left London this year, that this Epitaph gave occasion to a Remonstrance to the MONARCH OF LITERATURE, for an account of which I am indebted to Sir William Forbes, of Pitsligo.</p>
<p class="p24">That my readers may have the subject more fully and clearly before them, I shall first insert the Epitaph.</p>

<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;April IV, MDCCLXXIV.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Sir William Forbes writes to me thus: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I enclose the Round Robin. This jeu d&rsquo;esprit took its rise one day at dinner at our friend Sir Joshua Reynolds&rsquo;s. All the company present, except myself, were friends and acquaintance of Dr. Goldsmith. The Epitaph, written for him by Dr. Johnson, became the subject of conversation, and various emendations were suggested, which it was agreed should be submitted to the Doctor&rsquo;s consideration. But the question was, who should have the courage to propose them to him? At last it was hinted, that there could be no way so good as that of a Round Robin, as the sailors call it, which they make use of when they enter into a conspiracy, so as not to let it be known who puts his name first or last to the paper. This proposition was instantly assented to; and Dr. Barnard, Dean of Derry, now Bishop of Killaloe, drew up an address to Dr. Johnson on the occasion, replete with wit and humour, but which it was feared the Doctor might think treated the subject with too much levity. Mr. Burke then proposed the address as it stands in the paper in writing, to which I had the honour to officiate as clerk.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Sir Joshua agreed to carry it to Dr. Johnson, who received it with much good humour,* and desired Sir Joshua to tell the gentlemen, that he would alter the Epitaph in any manner they pleased, as to the sense of it; but he would never consent to disgrace the walls of Westminster Abbey with an English inscription.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* He however, upon seeing Dr. Warton&rsquo;s name to the</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;suggestion, that the Epitaph should be in English, observed</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to Sir Joshua, &lsquo;I wonder that Joe Warton, a scholar by</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;profession, should be such a fool.&rsquo; He said too, &lsquo;I should</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have thought Mund Burke would have had more sense.&rsquo;&nbsp; Mr.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Langton, who was one of the company at Sir Joshua&rsquo;s, like a</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sturdy scholar, resolutely refused to sign the Round Robin.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Epitaph is engraved upon Dr. Goldsmith&rsquo;s monument</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;without any alteration.&nbsp; At another time, when somebody</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;endeavoured to argue in favour of its being in English,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Johnson said, &lsquo;The language of the country of which a</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;learned man was a native, is not the language fit for his</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;epitaph, which should be in ancient and permanent language.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consider, Sir; how you should feel, were you to find at</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rotterdam an epitaph upon Erasmus IN DUTCH!&rsquo; &mdash; BOSWELL.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I consider this Round Robin as a species of literary curiosity worth preserving, as it marks, in a certain degree, Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s character.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Sir William Forbes&rsquo;s observation is very just. The anecdote now related proves, in the strongest manner, the reverence and awe with which Johnson was regarded, by some of the most eminent men of his time, in various departments, and even by such of them as lived most with him; while it also confirms what I have again and again inculcated, that he was by no means of that ferocious and irascible character which has been ignorantly imagined.</p>
<p class="p24">This hasty composition is also to be remarked as one of a thousand instances which evince the extraordinary promptitude of Mr. Burke; who while he is equal to the greatest things, can adorn the least; can, with equal facility, embrace the vast and complicated speculations of politicks, or the ingenious topicks of literary investigation.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;DR. JOHNSON TO MRS. BOSWELL.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;MADAM, &mdash; You must not think me uncivil in omitting to answer the letter with which you favoured me some time ago. I imagined it to have been written without Mr. Boswell&rsquo;s knowledge, and therefore supposed the answer to require, what I could not find, a private conveyance.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The difference with Lord Auchinleck is now over; and since young Alexander has appeared, I hope no more difficulties will arise among you; for I sincerely wish you all happy. Do not teach the young ones to dislike me, as you dislike me yourself; but let me at least have Veronica&rsquo;s kindness, because she is my acquaintance.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;You will now have Mr. Boswell home; it is well that you have him; he has led a wild life. I have taken him to Lichfield, and he has followed Mr. Thrale to Bath. Pray take care of him, and tame him. The only thing in which I have the honour to agree with you is, in loving him; and while we are so much of a mind in a matter of so much importance, our other quarrels will, I hope, produce no great bitterness. I am, Madam, your most humble servant,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;May 16, 1776.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I select from his private register the following passage:</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;July 25, 1776. O God, who hast ordained that whatever is to be desired should be sought by labour, and who, by thy blessing, bringest honest labour to good effect, look with mercy upon my studies and endeavours. Grant me, O LORD, to design only what is lawful and right; and afford me calmness of mind, and steadiness of purpose, that I may so do thy will in this short life, as to obtain happiness in the world to come, for the sake of JESUS CHRIST our Lord. Amen.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">It appears from a note subjoined, that this was composed when he &lsquo;purposed to apply vigorously to study, particularly of the Greek and Italian tongues.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Such a purpose, so expressed, at the age of sixty-seven, is admirable and encouraging; and it must impress all the thinking part of my readers with a consolatory confidence in habitual devotion, when they see a man of such enlarged intellectual powers as Johnson, thus in the genuine earnestness of secrecy, imploring the aid of that Supreme Being, &lsquo;from whom cometh down every good and every perfect gift.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">1777: AETAT. 68.] &mdash; In 1777, it appears from his Prayers and Meditations, that Johnson suffered much from a state of mind &lsquo;unsettled and perplexed,&rsquo; and from that constitutional gloom, which, together with his extreme humility and anxiety with regard to his religious state, made him contemplate himself through too dark and unfavourable a medium. It may be said of him, that he &lsquo;saw GOD in clouds.&rsquo; Certain we may be of his injustice to himself in the following lamentable paragraph, which it is painful to think came from the contrite heart of this great man, to whose labours the world is so much indebted: &lsquo;When I survey my past life, I discover nothing but a barren waste of time with some disorders of body, and disturbances of the mind, very near to madness, which I hope He that made me will suffer to extenuate many faults, and excuse many deficiencies.&rsquo; But we find his devotions in this year eminently fervent; and we are comforted by observing intervals of quiet, composure, and gladness.</p>
<p class="p24">On Easter-day we find the following emphatick prayer:</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Almighty and most merciful Father, who seest all our miseries, and knowest all our necessities, look down upon me, and pity me. Defend me from the violent incursion [incursions] of evil thoughts, and enable me to form and keep such resolutions as may conduce to the discharge of the duties which thy providence shall appoint me; and so help me, by thy Holy Spirit, that my heart may surely there be fixed, where true joys are to be found, and that I may serve thee with pure affection and a cheerful mind. Have mercy upon me, O GOD, have mercy upon me; years and infirmities oppress me, terrour and anxiety beset me. Have mercy upon me, my Creator and my Judge. [In all dangers protect me.] In all perplexities relieve and free me; and so help me by thy Holy Spirit, that I may now so commemorate the death of thy Son our Saviour JESUS CHRIST, as that when this short and painful life shall have an end, I may, for his sake, be received to everlasting happiness. Amen.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;SIR ALEXANDER DICK TO DR. SAMUEL JOHNSON.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Prestonfield, Feb. 17, 1777.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;SIR, I had yesterday the honour of receiving your book of your Journey to the Western Islands of Scotland, which you was so good as to send me, by the hands of our mutual friend, Mr. Boswell, of Auchinleck; for which I return you my most hearty thanks; and after carefully reading it over again, shall deposit in my little collection of choice books, next our worthy friend&rsquo;s Journey to Corsica. As there are many things to admire in both performances, I have often wished that no Travels or Journeys should be published but those undertaken by persons of integrity and capacity to judge well, and describe faithfully, and in good language, the situation, condition, and manners of the countries past through. Indeed our country of Scotland, in spite of the union of the crowns, is still in most places so devoid of clothing, or cover from hedges and plantations, that it was well you gave your readers a sound Monitoire with respect to that circumstance. The truths you have told, and the purity of the language in which they are expressed, as your Journey is universally read, may, and already appear to have a very good effect. For a man of my acquaintance, who has the largest nursery for trees and hedges in this country, tells me, that of late the demand upon him for these articles is doubled, and sometimes tripled. I have, therefore, listed Dr. Samuel Johnson in some of my memorandums of the principal planters and favourers of the enclosures, under a name which I took the liberty to invent from the Greek, Papadendrion. Lord Auchinleck and some few more are of the list. I am told that one gentleman in the shire of Aberdeen, viz. Sir Archibald Grant, has planted above fifty millions of trees on a piece of very wild ground at Monimusk: I must enquire if he has fenced them well, before he enters my list; for, that is the soul of enclosing. I began myself to plant a little, our ground being too valuable for much, and that is now fifty years ago; and the trees, now in my seventy-fourth year, I look up to with reverence, and shew them to my eldest son now in his fifteenth year, and they are full the height of my country-house here, where I had the pleasure of receiving you, and hope again to have that satisfaction with our mutual friend, Mr. Boswell. I shall always continue, with the truest esteem, dear Doctor, your much obliged, and obedient humble servant,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;ALEXANDER DICK.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To JAMES BOSWELL, ESQ.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;DEAR SIR, &mdash; It is so long since I heard any thing from you, that I am not easy about it; write something to me next post. When you sent your last letter, every thing seemed to be mending; I hope nothing has lately grown worse. I suppose young Alexander continues to thrive, and Veronica is now very pretty company. I do not suppose the lady is yet reconciled to me, yet let her know that I love her very well, and value her very much. . . .</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Poor Beauclerk still continues very ill. Langton lives on as he used to do. His children are very pretty, and, I think, his lady loses her Scotch. Paoli I never see.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I have been so distressed by difficulty of breathing, that I lost, as was computed, six-and-thirty ounces of blood in a few days. I am better, but not well. . . .</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Mrs. Williams sends her compliments, and promises that when you come hither, she will accommodate you as well as ever she can in the old room. She wishes to know whether you sent her book to Sir Alexander Gordon.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;My dear Boswell, do not neglect to write to me; for your kindness is one of the pleasures of my life, which I should be sorry to lose. I am, Sir, your humble servant,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;February 18, 1777.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To DR. SAMUEL JOHNSON.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Glasgow, April 24, 1777.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;MY DEAR SIR, . . . My wife has made marmalade of oranges for you. I left her and my daughters and Alexander all well yesterday. I have taught Veronica to speak of you thus; &mdash; Dr. JohnSON, not JohnSTON. I remain, my dear Sir, your most affectionate, and obliged humble servant,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;JAMES BOSWELL.&rsquo; &lsquo;TO JAMES BOSWELL, ESQ.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;DEAR SIR, . . . Tell Mrs. Boswell that I shall taste her marmalade cautiously at first. Timeo Danaos et dona ferentes. Beware, says the Italian proverb, of a reconciled enemy. But when I find it does me no harm, I shall then receive it and be thankful for it, as a pledge of firm, and, I hope, of unalterable kindness. She is, after all, a dear, dear lady. . . .</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am, dear Sir, your most affectionate humble servant,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;May 3, 1777.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo; &lsquo;TO JAMES BOSWELL, ESQ.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Southill, Sept. 26, 1777.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;DEAR SIR, You will find by this letter, that I am still in the same calm retreat, from the noise and bustle of London, as when I wrote to you last. I am happy to find you had such an agreeable meeting with your old friend Dr. Johnson; I have no doubt your stock is much increased by the interview; few men, nay I may say, scarcely any man, has got that fund of knowledge and entertainment as Dr. Johnson in conversation. When he opens freely, every one is attentive to what he says, and cannot fail of improvement as well as pleasure.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The edition of The Poets, now printing, will do honour to the English press; and a concise account of the life of each authour, by Dr. Johnson, will be a very valuable addition, and stamp the reputation of this edition superiour to any thing that is gone before. The first cause that gave rise to this undertaking, I believe, was owing to the little trifling edition of The Poets, printing by the Martins, at Edinburgh, and to be sold by Bell, in London. Upon examining the volumes which were printed, the type was found so extremely small, that many persons could not read them; not only this inconvenience attended it, but the inaccuracy of the press was very conspicuous. These reasons, as well as the idea of an invasion of what we call our Literary Property, induced the London Booksellers to print an elegant and accurate edition of all the English Poets of reputation, from Chaucer to the present time.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Accordingly a select number of the most respectable booksellers met on the occasion; and, on consulting together, agreed, that all the proprietors of copy-right in the various Poets should be summoned together; and when their opinions were given, to proceed immediately on the business. Accordingly a meeting was held, consisting of about forty of the most respectable booksellers of London, when it was agreed that an elegant and uniform edition of The English Poets should be immediately printed, with a concise account of the life of each authour, by Dr. Samuel Johnson; and that three persons should be deputed to wait upon Dr. Johnson, to solicit him to undertake the Lives, viz., T. Davies, Strahan, and Cadell. The Doctor very politely undertook it, and seemed exceedingly pleased with the proposal. As to the terms, it was left entirely to the Doctor to name his own: he mentioned two hundred guineas:* it was immediately agreed to; and a farther compliment, I believe, will be made him. A committee was likewise appointed to engage the best engravers, viz., Bartolozzi, Sherwin, Hall, etc. Likewise another committee for giving directions about the paper, printing, etc., so that the whole will be conducted with spirit, and in the best manner, with respect to authourship, editorship, engravings, etc., etc. My brother will give you a list of the Poets we mean to give, many of which are within the time of the Act of Queen Anne, which Martin and Bell cannot give, as they have no property in them; the proprietors are almost all the booksellers in London, of consequence. I am, dear Sir, ever your&rsquo;s,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;EDWARD DILLY.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Johnson&rsquo;s moderation in demanding so small a sum is</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;extraordinary.&nbsp; Had he asked one thousand, or even fifteen</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hundred guineas, the booksellers, who knew the value of his</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;name, would doubtless have readily given it.&nbsp; They have</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;probably got five thousand guineas by this work in the</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;course of twenty-five years. &mdash; MALONE.</p>
<p class="p24">A circumstance which could not fail to be very pleasing to Johnson occurred this year. The Tragedy of Sir Thomas Overbury, written by his early companion in London, Richard Savage, was brought out with alterations at Drury-lane theatre. The Prologue to it was written by Mr. Richard Brinsley Sheridan; in which, after describing very pathetically the wretchedness of</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Ill-fated Savage, at whose birth was giv&rsquo;n</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No parent but the Muse, no friend but Heav&rsquo;n:&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">he introduced an elegant compliment to Johnson on his Dictionary, that wonderful performance which cannot be too often or too highly praised; of which Mr. Harris, in his Philological Inquiries, justly and liberally observes: &lsquo;Such is its merit, that our language does not possess a more copious, learned, and valuable work.&rsquo; The concluding lines of this Prologue were these: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;So pleads the tale that gives to future times</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The son&rsquo;s misfortunes and the parent&rsquo;s crimes;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There shall his fame (if own&rsquo;d to-night) survive,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fix&rsquo;d by THE HAND THAT BIDS OUR LANGUAGE LIVE.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Mr. Sheridan here at once did honour to his taste and to his liberality of sentiment, by shewing that he was not prejudiced from the unlucky difference which had taken place between his worthy father and Dr. Johnson. I have already mentioned, that Johnson was very desirous of reconciliation with old Mr. Sheridan. It will, therefore, not seem at all surprizing that he was zealous in acknowledging the brilliant merit of his son. While it had as yet been displayed only in the drama, Johnson proposed him as a member of THE LITERARY CLUB, observing, that &lsquo;He who has written the two best comedies of his age, is surely a considerable man.&rsquo; And he had, accordingly, the honour to be elected; for an honour it undoubtedly must be allowed to be, when it is considered of whom that society consists, and that a single black ball excludes a candidate.</p>
<p class="p24">On the 23rd of June, I again wrote to Dr. Johnson, enclosing a ship-master&rsquo;s receipt for a jar of orange-marmalade, and a large packet of Lord Hailes&rsquo;s Annals of Scotland.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;DR. JOHNSON TO MRS. BOSWELL.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;MADAM, &mdash; Though I am well enough pleased with the taste of sweetmeats, very little of the pleasure which I received at the arrival of your jar of marmalade arose from eating it. I received it as a token of friendship, as a proof of reconciliation, things much sweeter than sweetmeats, and upon this consideration I return you, dear Madam, my sincerest thanks. By having your kindness I think I have a double security for the continuance of Mr. Boswell&rsquo;s, which it is not to be expected that any man can long keep, when the influence of a lady so highly and so justly valued operates against him. Mr. Boswell will tell you that I was always faithful to your interest, and always endeavoured to exalt you in his estimation. You must now do the same for me. We must all help one another, and you must now consider me, as, dear Madam, your most obliged, and most humble servant,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;July 22, 1777.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To JAMES BOSWELL, ESQ.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;DEAR SIR, &mdash; I am this day come to Ashbourne, and have only to tell you, that Dr. Taylor says you shall be welcome to him, and you know how welcome you will be to me. Make haste to let me know when you may be expected.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Make my compliments to Mrs. Boswell, and tell her, I hope we shall be at variance no more. I am, dear Sir, your most humble servant,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;August 30, 1777.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Sunday evening, Sept. 14, I arrived at Ashbourne, and drove directly up to Dr. Taylor&rsquo;s door. Dr. Johnson and he appeared before I had got out of the post-chaise, and welcomed me cordially.</p>
<p class="p24">I told them that I had travelled all the preceding night, and gone to bed at Leek in Staffordshire; and that when I rose to go to church in the afternoon, I was informed there had been an earthquake, of which, it seems, the shock had been felt in some degree at Ashbourne. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir it will be much exaggerated in popular talk: for, in the first place, the common people do not accurately adapt their thoughts to the objects; nor, secondly, do they accurately adapt their words to their thoughts: they do not mean to lie; but, taking no pains to be exact, they give you very false accounts. A great part of their language is proverbial. If anything rocks at all, they say it rocks like a cradle; and in this way they go on.</p>
<p class="p24">The subject of grief for the loss of relations and friends being introduced, I observed that it was strange to consider how soon it in general wears away. Dr. Taylor mentioned a gentleman of the neighbourhood as the only instance he had ever known of a person who had endeavoured to RETAIN grief. He told Dr. Taylor, that after his Lady&rsquo;s death, which affected him deeply, he RESOLVED that the grief, which he cherished with a kind of sacred fondness, should be lasting; but that he found he could not keep it long. JOHNSON. &lsquo;All grief for what cannot in the course of nature be helped, soon wears away; in some sooner, indeed, in some later; but it never continues very long, unless where there is madness, such as will make a man have pride so fixed in his mind, as to imagine himself a King; or any other passion in an unreasonable way: for all unnecessary grief is unwise, and therefore will not be long retained by a sound mind. If, indeed, the cause of our grief is occasioned by our own misconduct, if grief is mingled with remorse of conscience, it should be lasting.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;But, Sir, we do not approve of a man who very soon forgets the loss of a wife or a friend.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, we disapprove of him, not because he soon forgets his grief, for the sooner it is forgotten the better, but because we suppose, that if he forgets his wife or his friend soon, he has not had much affection for them.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I was somewhat disappointed in finding that the edition of The English Poets, for which he was to write Prefaces and Lives, was not an undertaking directed by him: but that he was to furnish a Preface and Life to any poet the booksellers pleased. I asked him if he would do this to any dunce&rsquo;s works, if they should ask him. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Yes, Sir, and SAY he was a dunce.&rsquo; My friend seemed now not much to relish talking of this edition.</p>
<p class="p24">After breakfast,* Johnson carried me to see the garden belonging to the school of Ashbourne, which is very prettily formed upon a bank, rising gradually behind the house. The Reverend Mr. Langley, the head-master, accompanied us.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Next morning. &mdash; ED.</p>
<p class="p24">We had with us at dinner several of Dr. Taylor&rsquo;s neighbours, good civil gentlemen, who seemed to understand Dr. Johnson very well, and not to consider him in the light that a certain person did, who being struck, or rather stunned by his voice and manner, when he was afterwards asked what he thought of him, answered. &lsquo;He&rsquo;s a tremendous companion.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson told me, that &lsquo;Taylor was a very sensible acute man, and had a strong mind; that he had great activity in some respects, and yet such a sort of indolence, that if you should put a pebble upon his chimney-piece, you would find it there, in the same state, a year afterwards.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">And here is the proper place to give an account of Johnson&rsquo;s humane and zealous interference in behalf of the Reverend Dr. William Dodd, formerly Prebendary of Brecon, and chaplain in ordinary to his Majesty; celebrated as a very popular preacher, an encourager of charitable institutions, and authour of a variety of works, chiefly theological. Having unhappily contracted expensive habits of living, partly occasioned by licentiousness of manners, he in an evil hour, when pressed by want of money, and dreading an exposure of his circumstances, forged a bond of which he attempted to avail himself to support his credit, flattering himself with hopes that he might be able to repay its amount without being detected. The person, whose name he thus rashly and criminally presumed to falsify, was the Earl of Chesterfield, to whom he had been tutor, and who, he perhaps, in the warmth of his feelings, flattered himself would have generously paid the money in case of an alarm being taken, rather than suffer him to fall a victim to the dreadful consequences of violating the law against forgery, the most dangerous crime in a commercial country; but the unfortunate divine had the mortification to find that he was mistaken. His noble pupil appeared against him, and he was capitally convicted.</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson told me that Dr. Dodd was very little acquainted with him, having been but once in his company, many years previous to this period (which was precisely the state of my own acquaintance with Dodd); but in his distress he bethought himself of Johnson&rsquo;s persuasive power of writing, if haply it might avail to obtain for him the Royal Mercy. He did not apply to him directly, but, extraordinary as it may seem, through the late Countess of Harrington, who wrote a letter to Johnson, asking him to employ his pen in favour of Dodd. Mr. Allen, the printer, who was Johnson&rsquo;s landlord and next neighbour in Bolt-court, and for whom he had much kindness, was one of Dodd&rsquo;s friends, of whom to the credit of humanity be it recorded, that he had many who did not desert him, even after his infringement of the law had reduced him to the state of a man under sentence of death. Mr. Allen told me that he carried Lady Harrington&rsquo;s letter to Johnson, that Johnson read it walking up and down his chamber, and seemed much agitated, after which he said, &lsquo;I will do what I can;&rsquo; &mdash; and certainly he did make extraordinary exertions.</p>
<p class="p24">He this evening, as he had obligingly promised in one of his letters, put into my hands the whole series of his writings upon this melancholy occasion.</p>
<p class="p24">Dr. Johnson wrote in the first place, Dr. Dodd&rsquo;s Speech to the Recorder of London, at the Old-Bailey, when sentence of death was about to be pronounced upon him.</p>
<p class="p24">He wrote also The Convict&rsquo;s Address to his unhappy Brethren, a sermon delivered by Dr. Dodd, in the chapel of Newgate.</p>
<p class="p24">The other pieces mentioned by Johnson in the above-mentioned collection, are two letters, one to the Lord Chancellor Bathurst, (not Lord North, as is erroneously supposed,) and one to Lord Mansfield; &mdash; A Petition from Dr. Dodd to the King; &mdash; A Petition from Mrs. Dodd to the Queen; &mdash; Observations of some length inserted in the news-papers, on occasion of Earl Percy&rsquo;s having presented to his Majesty a petition for mercy to Dodd, signed by twenty thousand people, but all in vain. He told me that he had also written a petition from the city of London; &lsquo;but (said he, with a significant smile) they MENDED it.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">The last of these articles which Johnson wrote is Dr. Dodd&rsquo;s last solemn Declaration, which he left with the sheriff at the place of execution.</p>
<p class="p24">I found a letter to Dr. Johnson from Dr. Dodd, May 23, 1777, in which The Convict&rsquo;s Address seems clearly to be meant.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am so penetrated, my ever dear Sir, with a sense of your extreme benevolence towards me, that I cannot find words equal to the sentiments of my heart. . . .&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Sunday, June 22, he writes, begging Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s assistance in framing a supplicatory letter to his Majesty.</p>
<p class="p24">This letter was brought to Dr. Johnson when in church. He stooped down and read it, and wrote, when he went home, the following letter for Dr. Dodd to the King:</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;SIR, &mdash; May it not offend your Majesty, that the most miserable of men applies himself to your clemency, as his last hope and his last refuge; that your mercy is most earnestly and humbly implored by a clergyman, whom your Laws and Judges have condemned to the horrour and ignominy of a publick execution. . . .&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Subjoined to it was written as follows: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;TO DR. DODD.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;SIR, &mdash; I most seriously enjoin you not to let it be at all known that I have written this letter, and to return the copy to Mr. Allen in a cover to me. I hope I need not tell you, that I wish it success. &mdash; But do not indulge hope. &mdash; Tell nobody.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">It happened luckily that Mr. Allen was pitched on to assist in this melancholy office, for he was a great friend of Mr. Akerman, the keeper of Newgate. Dr. Johnson never went to see Dr. Dodd. He said to me, &lsquo;it would have done HIM more harm, than good to Dodd, who once expressed a desire to see him, but not earnestly.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">All applications for the Royal Mercy having failed, Dr. Dodd prepared himself for death; and, with a warmth of gratitude, wrote to Dr. Johnson as follows: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;June 25, Midnight.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Accept, thou GREAT and GOOD heart, my earnest and fervent thanks and prayers for all thy benevolent and kind efforts in my behalf &mdash; Oh! Dr. Johnson! as I sought your knowledge at an early hour in life, would to heaven I had cultivated the love and acquaintance of so excellent a man! &mdash; I pray GOD most sincerely to bless you with the highest transports &mdash; the infelt satisfaction of HUMANE and benevolent exertions! &mdash; And admitted, as I trust I shall be, to the realms of bliss before you, I shall hail YOUR arrival there with transports, and rejoice to acknowledge that you was my Comforter, my Advocate and my FRIEND! GOD BE EVER WITH YOU!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Dr. Johnson lastly wrote to Dr. Dodd this solemn and soothing letter: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;TO THE REVEREND DR. DODD.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;DEAR SIR, &mdash; That which is appointed to all men is now coming upon you. Outward circumstances, the eyes and the thoughts of men, are below the notice of an immortal being about to stand the trial for eternity, before the Supreme Judge of heaven and earth. Be comforted: your crime, morally or religiously considered, has no very deep dye of turpitude. It corrupted no man&rsquo;s principles; it attacked no man&rsquo;s life. It involved only a temporary and reparable injury. Of this, and of all other sins, you are earnestly to repent; and may GOD, who knoweth our frailty, and desireth not our death, accept your repentance, for the sake of his SON JESUS CHRIST our Lord.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;In requital of those well-intended offices which you are pleased so emphatically to acknowledge, let me beg that you make in your devotions one petition for my eternal welfare. I am, dear Sir, your affectionate servant,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;June 26, 1777.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Under the copy of this letter I found written, in Johnson&rsquo;s own hand, &lsquo;Next day, June 27, he was executed.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Tuesday, September 16, Dr. Johnson having mentioned to me the extraordinary size and price of some cattle reared by Dr. Taylor, I rode out with our host, surveyed his farm, and was shown one cow which he had sold for a hundred and twenty guineas, and another for which he had been offered a hundred and thirty. Taylor thus described to me his old schoolfellow and friend, Johnson: &lsquo;He is a man of a very clear head, great power of words, and a very gay imagination; but there is no disputing with him. He will not hear you, and having a louder voice than you, must roar you down.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">In the evening, the Reverend Mr. Seward, of Lichfield, who was passing through Ashbourne in his way home, drank tea with us. Johnson described him thus:&mdash; &lsquo;Sir, his ambition is to be a fine talker; so he goes to Buxton, and such places, where he may find companies to listen to him. And, Sir, he is a valetudinarian, one of those who are always mending themselves. I do not know a more disagreeable character than a valetudinarian, who thinks he may do any thing that is for his ease, and indulges himself in the grossest freedoms: Sir, he brings himself to the state of a hog in a stye.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Dr. Taylor&rsquo;s nose happening to bleed, he said, it was because he had omitted to have himself blooded four days after a quarter of a year&rsquo;s interval. Dr. Johnson, who was a great dabbler in physick, disapproved much of periodical bleeding. &lsquo;For (said he,) you accustom yourself to an evacuation which Nature cannot perform of herself, and therefore she cannot help you, should you, from forgetfulness or any other cause, omit it; so you may be suddenly suffocated. You may accustom yourself to other periodical evacuations, because should you omit them, Nature can supply the omission; but Nature cannot open a vein to blood you.&rsquo;&mdash; &lsquo;I do not like to take an emetick, (said Taylor,) for fear of breaking some small vessels.&rsquo;&mdash; &lsquo;Poh! (said Johnson,) if you have so many things that will break, you had better break your neck at once, and there&rsquo;s an end on&rsquo;t. You will break no small vessels:&rsquo; (blowing with high derision.)</p>
<p class="p24">The horrour of death which I had always observed in Dr. Johnson, appeared strong to-night. I ventured to tell him, that I had been, for moments in my life, not afraid of death; therefore I could suppose another man in that state of mind for a considerable space of time. He said, &lsquo;he never had a moment in which death was not terrible to him.&rsquo; He added, that it had been observed, that scarce any man dies in publick, but with apparent resolution; from that desire of praise which never quits us. I said, Dr. Dodd seemed to be willing to die, and full of hopes of happiness. &lsquo;Sir, (said he,) Dr. Dodd would have given both his hands and both his legs to have lived. The better a man is, the more afraid he is of death, having a clearer view of infinite purity.&rsquo; He owned, that our being in an unhappy uncertainty as to our salvation, was mysterious; and said, &lsquo;Ah! we must wait till we are in another state of being, to have many things explained to us.&rsquo; Even the powerful mind of Johnson seemed foiled by futurity.</p>
<p class="p24">On Wednesday, September 17, Dr. Butter, physician at Derby, drank tea with us; and it was settled that Dr. Johnson and I should go on Friday and dine with him. Johnson said, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m glad of this.&rsquo; He seemed weary of the uniformity of life at Dr. Taylor&rsquo;s.</p>
<p class="p24">Talking of biography, I said, in writing a life, a man&rsquo;s peculiarities should be mentioned, because they mark his character. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, there is no doubt as to peculiarities: the question is, whether a man&rsquo;s vices should be mentioned; for instance, whether it should be mentioned that Addison and Parnell drank too freely: for people will probably more easily indulge in drinking from knowing this; so that more ill may be done by the example, than good by telling the whole truth.&rsquo; Here was an instance of his varying from himself in talk; for when Lord Hailes and he sat one morning calmly conversing in my house at Edinburgh, I well remember that Dr. Johnson maintained, that &lsquo;If a man is to write A Panegyrick, he may keep vices out of sight; but if he professes to write A Life, he must represent it really as it was:&rsquo; and when I objected to the danger of telling that Parnell drank to excess, he said, that &lsquo;it would produce an instructive caution to avoid drinking, when it was seen, that even the learning and genius of Parnell could be debased by it.&rsquo; And in the Hebrides he maintained, as appears from my Journal, that a man&rsquo;s intimate friend should mention his faults, if he writes his life.</p>
<p class="p24">Thursday, September 18. Last night Dr. Johnson had proposed that the crystal lustre, or chandelier, in Dr. Taylor&rsquo;s large room, should be lighted up some time or other. Taylor said, it should be lighted up next night. &lsquo;That will do very well, (said I,) for it is Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s birth-day.&rsquo; When we were in the Isle of Sky, Johnson had desired me not to mention his birth-day. He did not seem pleased at this time that I mentioned it, and said (somewhat sternly,) &lsquo;he would not have the lustre lighted the next day.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Some ladies, who had been present yesterday when I mentioned his birth-day, came to dinner to-day, and plagued him unintentionally, by wishing him joy. I know not why he disliked having his birth-day mentioned, unless it were that it reminded him of his approaching nearer to death, of which he had a constant dread.</p>
<p class="p24">I mentioned to him a friend of mine who was formerly gloomy from low spirits, and much distressed by the fear of death, but was now uniformly placid, and contemplated his dissolution without any perturbation. &lsquo;Sir, (said Johnson,) this is only a disordered imagination taking a different turn.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He observed, that a gentleman of eminence in literature had got into a bad style of poetry of late. &lsquo;He puts (said he,) a very common thing in a strange dress till he does not know it himself, and thinks other people do not know it.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;That is owing to his being so much versant in old English poetry.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;What is that to the purpose, Sir? If I say a man is drunk, and you tell me it is owing to his taking much drink, the matter is not mended. No, Sir, &mdash;&mdash;&nbsp; &mdash; has taken to an odd mode. For example, he&rsquo;d write thus:</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Hermit hoar, in solemn cell,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wearing out life&rsquo;s evening gray.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Gray evening is common enough; but evening gray he&rsquo;d think fine. &mdash; Stay; &mdash; we&rsquo;ll make out the stanza:</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Hermit hoar, in solemn cell,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wearing out life&rsquo;s evening gray;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smite thy bosom, sage, and tell,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is bliss? and which the way?&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">BOSWELL. &lsquo;But why smite his bosom, Sir?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, to shew he was in earnest,&rsquo; (smiling.) &mdash; He at an after period added the following stanza:</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Thus I spoke; and speaking sigh&rsquo;d;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash; Scarce repress&rsquo;d the starting tear; &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the smiling sage reply&rsquo;d &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash; Come, my lad, and drink some beer.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I cannot help thinking the first stanza very good solemn poetry, as also the three first lines of the second. Its last line is an excellent burlesque surprise on gloomy sentimental enquirers. And, perhaps, the advice is as good as can be given to a low-spirited dissatisfied being:&mdash; &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t trouble your head with sickly thinking: take a cup, and be merry.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Friday, September 19, after breakfast Dr. Johnson and I set out in Dr. Taylor&rsquo;s chaise to go to Derby. The day was fine, and we resolved to go by Keddlestone, the seat of Lord Scarsdale, that I might see his Lordship&rsquo;s fine house. I was struck with the magnificence of the building; and the extensive park, with the finest verdure, covered with deer, and cattle, and sheep, delighted me. The number of old oaks, of an immense size, filled me with a sort of respectful admiration: for one of them sixty pounds was offered. The excellent smooth gravel roads; the large piece of water formed by his Lordship from some small brooks, with a handsome barge upon it; the venerable Gothick church, now the family chapel, just by the house; in short, the grand group of objects agitated and distended my mind in a most agreeable manner. &lsquo;One should think (said I,) that the proprietor of all this MUST be happy.&rsquo;&mdash; &lsquo;Nay, Sir, (said Johnson,) all this excludes but one evil &mdash; poverty.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Our names were sent up, and a well-drest elderly housekeeper, a most distinct articulator, shewed us the house; which I need not describe, as there is an account of it published in Adam&rsquo;s Works in Architecture. Dr. Johnson thought better of it to-day than when he saw it before; for he had lately attacked it violently, saying, &lsquo;It would do excellently for a town-hall. The large room with the pillars (said he,) would do for the Judges to sit in at the assizes; the circular room for a jury-chamber; and the room above for prisoners.&rsquo; Still he thought the large room ill lighted, and of no use but for dancing in; and the bed-chambers but indifferent rooms; and that the immense sum which it cost was injudiciously laid out. Dr. Taylor had put him in mind of his APPEARING pleased with the house. &lsquo;But (said he,) that was when Lord Scarsdale was present. Politeness obliges us to appear pleased with a man&rsquo;s works when he is present. No man will be so ill bred as to question you. You may therefore pay compliments without saying what is not true. I should say to Lord Scarsdale of his large room, &ldquo;My Lord, this is the most COSTLY room that I ever saw;&rdquo; which is true.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Dr. Manningham, physician in London, who was visiting at Lord Scarsdale&rsquo;s, accompanyed us through many of the rooms, and soon afterwards my Lord himself, to whom Dr. Johnson was known, appeared, and did the honours of the house. We talked of Mr. Langton. Johnson, with a warm vehemence of affectionate regard, exclaimed, &lsquo;The earth does not bear a worthier man than Bennet Langton.&rsquo; We saw a good many fine pictures, which I think are described in one of Young&rsquo;s Tours. There is a printed catalogue of them which the housekeeper put into my hand; I should like to view them at leisure. I was much struck with Daniel interpreting Nebuchadnezzar&rsquo;s dream by Rembrandt. We were shown a pretty large library. In his Lordship&rsquo;s dressing-room lay Johnson&rsquo;s small Dictionary: he shewed it to me, with some eagerness, saying, &lsquo;Look&rsquo;ye! Quae terra nostri non plena laboris.&rsquo; He observed, also, Goldsmith&rsquo;s Animated Nature; and said, &lsquo;Here&rsquo;s our friend! The poor Doctor would have been happy to hear of this.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">In our way, Johnson strongly expressed his love of driving fast in a post-chaise. &lsquo;If (said he,) I had no duties, and no reference to futurity, I would spend my life in driving briskly in a post-chaise with a pretty woman; but she should be one who could understand me, and would add something to the conversation.&rsquo; I observed, that we were this day to stop just where the Highland army did in 1745. JOHNSON. &lsquo;It was a noble attempt.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;I wish we could have an authentick history of it.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;If you were not an idle dog you might write it, by collecting from every body what they can tell, and putting down your authorities.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;But I could not have the advantage of it in my life-time.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;You might have the satisfaction of its fame, by printing it in Holland; and as to profit, consider how long it was before writing came to be considered in a pecuniary view. Baretti says, he is the first man that ever received copy-money in Italy.&rsquo; I said that I would endeavour to do what Dr. Johnson suggested and I thought that I might write so as to venture to publish my History of the Civil War in Great-Britain in 1745 and 1746, without being obliged to go to a foreign press.</p>
<p class="p24">When we arrived at Derby, Dr. Butter accompanied us to see the manufactory of china there. I admired the ingenuity and delicate art with which a man fashioned clay into a cup, a saucer, or a tea-pot, while a boy turned round a wheel to give the mass rotundity. I thought this as excellent in its species of power, as making good verses in ITS species. Yet I had no respect for this potter. Neither, indeed, has a man of any extent of thinking for a mere verse-maker, in whose numbers, however perfect, there is no poetry, no mind. The china was beautiful, but Dr. Johnson justly observed it was too dear; for that he could have vessels of silver, of the same size, as cheap as what were here made of porcelain.</p>
<p class="p24">I felt a pleasure in walking about Derby such as I always have in walking about any town to which I am not accustomed. There is an immediate sensation of novelty; and one speculates on the way in which life is passed in it, which, although there is a sameness every where upon the whole, is yet minutely diversified. The minute diversities in every thing are wonderful. Talking of shaving the other night at Dr. Taylor&rsquo;s, Dr. Johnson said, &lsquo;Sir, of a thousand shavers, two do not shave so much alike as not to be distinguished.&rsquo; I thought this not possible, till he specified so many of the varieties in shaving; &mdash; holding the razor more or less perpendicular; &mdash; drawing long or short strokes; &mdash; beginning at the upper part of the face, or the under; &mdash; at the right side or the left side. Indeed, when one considers what variety of sounds can be uttered by the windpipe, in the compass of a very small aperture, we may be convinced how many degrees of difference there may be in the application of a razor.</p>
<p class="p24">We dined with Dr. Butter, whose lady is daughter of my cousin Sir John Douglas, whose grandson is now presumptive heir of the noble family of Queensberry. Johnson and he had a good deal of medical conversation. Johnson said, he had somewhere or other given an account of Dr. Nichols&rsquo;s discourse De Animia Medica. He told us &lsquo;that whatever a man&rsquo;s distemper was, Dr. Nichols would not attend him as a physician, if his mind was not at ease; for he believed that no medicines would have any influence. He once attended a man in trade, upon whom he found none of the medicines he prescribed had any effect: he asked the man&rsquo;s wife privately whether his affairs were not in a bad way? She said no. He continued his attendance some time, still without success. At length the man&rsquo;s wife told him, she had discovered that her husband&rsquo;s affairs WERE in a bad way. When Goldsmith was dying, Dr. Turton said to him, &ldquo;Your pulse is in greater disorder than it should be, from the degree of fever which you have: is your mind at ease?&rdquo; Goldsmith answered it was not.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Dr. Johnson told us at tea, that when some of Dr. Dodd&rsquo;s pious friends were trying to console him by saying that he was going to leave &lsquo;a wretched world,&rsquo; he had honesty enough not to join in the cant:&mdash; &lsquo;No, no, (said he,) it has been a very agreeable world to me.&rsquo; Johnson added, &lsquo;I respect Dodd for thus speaking the truth; for, to be sure, he had for several years enjoyed a life of great voluptuousness.</p>
<p class="p24">He told us, that Dodd&rsquo;s city friends stood by him so, that a thousand pounds were ready to be given to the gaoler, if he would let him escape. He added, that he knew a friend of Dodd&rsquo;s, who walked about Newgate for some time on the evening before the day of his execution, with five hundred pounds in his pocket, ready to be paid to any of the turnkeys who could get him out: but it was too late; for he was watched with much circumspection. He said, Dodd&rsquo;s friends had an image of him made of wax, which was to have been left in his place; and he believed it was carried into the prison.</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson disapproved of Dr. Dodd&rsquo;s leaving the world persuaded that The Convict&rsquo;s Address to his unhappy Brethren was of his own writing. &lsquo;But, Sir, (said I,) you contributed to the deception; for when Mr. Seward expressed a doubt to you that it was not Dodd&rsquo;s own, because it had a great deal more force of mind in it than any thing known to be his, you answered,&mdash; &ldquo;Why should you think so? Depend upon it, Sir, when a man knows he is to be hanged in a fortnight, it concentrates his mind wonderfully.&rdquo;&rsquo; JOHNSON. Sir, as Dodd got it from me to pass as his own, while that could do him any good, there was an IMPLIED PROMISE that I should not own it. To own it, therefore, would have been telling a lie, with the addition of breach of promise, which was worse than simply telling a lie to make it be believed it was Dodd&rsquo;s. Besides, Sir, I did not DIRECTLY tell a lie: I left the matter uncertain. Perhaps I thought that Seward would not believe it the less to be mine for what I said; but I would not put it in his power to say I had owned it.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He said, &lsquo;Goldsmith was a plant that flowered late. There appeared nothing remarkable about him when he was young; though when he had got high in fame, one of his friends began to recollect something of his being distinguished at College. Goldsmith in the same manner recollected more of that friend&rsquo;s early years, as he grew a greater man.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I mentioned that Lord Monboddo told me, he awaked every morning at four, and then for his health got up and walked in his room naked, with the window open, which he called taking an air bath; after which he went to bed again, and slept two hours more. Johnson, who was always ready to beat down any thing that seemed to be exhibited with disproportionate importance, thus observed: &lsquo;I suppose, Sir, there is no more in it than this, he awakes at four, and cannot sleep till he chills himself, and makes the warmth of the bed a grateful sensation.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I talked of the difficulty of rising in the morning. Dr. Johnson told me, &lsquo;that the learned Mrs. Carter, at that period when she was eager in study, did not awake as early as she wished, and she therefore had a contrivance, that, at a certain hour, her chamber-light should burn a string to which a heavy weight was suspended, which then fell with a strong sudden noise: this roused her from sleep, and then she had no difficulty in getting up.&rsquo; But I said THAT was my difficulty; and wished there could be some medicine invented which would make one rise without pain, which I never did, unless after lying in bed a very long time.</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson advised me to-night not to REFINE in the education of my children. &lsquo;Life (said he,) will not bear refinement: you must do as other people do.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">As we drove back to Ashbourne, Dr. Johnson recommended to me, as he had often done, to drink water only: &lsquo;For (said he,) you are then sure not to get drunk; whereas if you drink wine you are never sure.&rsquo; I said, drinking wine was a pleasure which I was unwilling to give up, &lsquo;Why, Sir, (said he,) there is no doubt that not to drink wine is a great deduction from life; but it may be necessary.&rsquo; He however owned, that in his opinion a free use of wine did not shorten life; and said, he would not give less for the life of a certain Scotch Lord (whom he named) celebrated for hard drinking, than for that of a sober man. &lsquo;But stay, (said he, with his usual intelligence, and accuracy of enquiry,) does it take much wine to make him drunk?&rsquo; I answered, &lsquo;a great deal either of wine or strong punch.&rsquo;&mdash; &lsquo;Then (said he,) that is the worse.&rsquo; I presume to illustrate my friend&rsquo;s observation thus: &lsquo;A fortress which soon surrenders has its walls less shattered than when a long and obstinate resistance is made.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I ventured to mention a person who was as violent a Scotsman as he was an Englishman; and literally had the same contempt for an Englishman compared with a Scotsman, that he had for a Scotsman compared with an Englishman; and that he would say of Dr. Johnson, &lsquo;Damned rascal! to talk as he does of the Scotch.&rsquo; This seemed, for a moment, &lsquo;to give him pause.&rsquo; It, perhaps, presented his extreme prejudice against the Scotch in a point of view somewhat new to him, by the effect of CONTRAST.</p>
<p class="p24">By the time when we returned to Ashbourne, Dr. Taylor was gone to bed. Johnson and I sat up a long time by ourselves.</p>
<p class="p24">On Saturday, September 20, after breakfast, when Taylor was gone out to his farm, Dr. Johnson and I had a serious conversation by ourselves on melancholy and madness.</p>
<p class="p24">We entered seriously upon a question of much importance to me, which Johnson was pleased to consider with friendly attention. I had long complained to him that I felt myself discontented in Scotland, as too narrow a sphere, and that I wished to make my chief residence in London, the great scene of ambition, instruction, and amusement: a scene, which was to me, comparatively speaking, a heaven upon earth. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, I never knew any one who had such a GUST for London as you have: and I cannot blame you for your wish to live there: yet, Sir, were I in your father&rsquo;s place, I should not consent to your settling there; for I have the old feudal notions, and I should be afraid that Auchinleck would be deserted, as you would soon find it more desirable to have a country-seat in a better climate.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I suggested a doubt, that if I were to reside in London, the exquisite zest with which I relished it in occasional visits might go off, and I might grow tired of it. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, you find no man, at all intellectual, who is willing to leave London. No, Sir, when a man is tired of London, he is tired of life; for there is in London all that life can afford.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He said, &lsquo;A country gentleman should bring his lady to visit London as soon as he can, that they may have agreeable topicks for conversation when they are by themselves.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">We talked of employment being absolutely necessary to preserve the mind from wearying and growing fretful, especially in those who have a tendency to melancholy; and I mentioned to him a saying which somebody had related of an American savage, who, when an European was expatiating on all the advantages of money, put this question: &lsquo;Will it purchase OCCUPATION?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Depend upon it, Sir, this saying is too refined for a savage. And, Sir, money WILL purchase occupation; it will purchase all the conveniences of life; it will purchase variety of company; it will purchase all sorts of entertainment.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I talked to him of Forster&rsquo;s Voyage to the South Seas, which pleased me; but I found he did not like it. &lsquo;Sir, (said he,) there is a great affectation of fine writing in it.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;But he carries you along with him.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;No, Sir; he does not carry ME along with him: he leaves me behind him: or rather, indeed, he sets me before him; for he makes me turn over many leaves at a time.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Sunday, September 21, we went to the church of Ashbourne, which is one of the largest and most luminous that I have seen in any town of the same size. I felt great satisfaction in considering that I was supported in my fondness for solemn publick worship by the general concurrence and munificence of mankind.</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson and Taylor were so different from each other, that I wondered at their preserving an intimacy. Their having been at school and college together, might, in some degree, account for this; but Sir Joshua Reynolds has furnished me with a stronger reason; for Johnson mentioned to him, that he had been told by Taylor he was to be his heir. I shall not take upon me to animadvert upon this; but certain it is, that Johnson paid great attention to Taylor. He now, however, said to me, &lsquo;Sir, I love him; but I do not love him more; my regard for him does not increase. As it is said in the Apocrypha, &ldquo;his talk is of bullocks:&rdquo; I do not suppose he is very fond of my company. His habits are by no means sufficiently clerical: this he knows that I see; and no man likes to live under the eye of perpetual disapprobation.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I have no doubt that a good many sermons were composed for Taylor by Johnson. At this time I found, upon his table, a part of one which he had newly begun to write: and Concio pro Tayloro appears in one of his diaries. When to these circumstances we add the internal evidence from the power of thinking and style, in the collection which the Reverend Mr. Hayes has published, with the SIGNIFICANT title of &lsquo;Sermons LEFT FOR PUBLICATION by the Reverend John Taylor, LL.D.,&rsquo; our conviction will be complete.</p>
<p class="p24">I, however, would not have it thought, that Dr. Taylor, though he could not write like Johnson, (as, indeed, who could?) did not sometimes compose sermons as good as those which we generally have from very respectable divines. He shewed me one with notes on the margin in Johnson&rsquo;s handwriting; and I was present when he read another to Johnson, that he might have his opinion of it, and Johnson said it was &lsquo;very well.&rsquo; These, we may be sure, were not Johnson&rsquo;s; for he was above little arts, or tricks of deception.</p>
<p class="p24">I mentioned to Johnson a respectable person of a very strong mind, who had little of that tenderness which is common to human nature; as an instance of which, when I suggested to him that he should invite his son, who had been settled ten years in foreign parts, to come home and pay him a visit, his answer was, &lsquo;No, no, let him mind his business. JOHNSON. &lsquo;I do not agree with him, Sir, in this. Getting money is not all a man&rsquo;s business: to cultivate kindness is a valuable part of the business of life.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">In the evening, Johnson, being in very good spirits, entertained us with several characteristical portraits. I regret that any of them escaped my retention and diligence. I found, from experience, that to collect my friend&rsquo;s conversation so as to exhibit it with any degree of its original flavour, it was necessary to write it down without delay. To record his sayings, after some distance of time, was like preserving or pickling long-kept and faded fruits, or other vegetables, which, when in that state, have little or nothing of their taste when fresh.</p>
<p class="p24">I shall present my readers with a series of what I gathered this evening from the Johnsonian garden.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Did we not hear so much said of Jack Wilkes, we should think more highly of his conversation. Jack has great variety of talk, Jack is a scholar, and Jack has the manners of a gentleman. But after hearing his name sounded from pole to pole, as the phoenix of convivial felicity, we are disappointed in his company. He has always been AT ME: but I would do Jack a kindness, rather than not. The contest is now over.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Colley Cibber once consulted me as to one of his birthday Odes, a long time before it was wanted. I objected very freely to several passages. Cibber lost patience, and would not read his Ode to an end. When we had done with criticism, we walked over to Richardson&rsquo;s, the authour of Clarissa and I wondered to find Richardson displeased that I &ldquo;did not treat Cibber with more RESPECT.&rdquo; Now, Sir, to talk of RESPECT for a PLAYER!&rsquo; (smiling disdainfully.) BOSWELL. &lsquo;There, Sir, you are always heretical: you never will allow merit to a player.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Merit, Sir! what merit? Do you respect a rope-dancer, or a ballad-singer?&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;No, Sir: but we respect a great player, as a man who can conceive lofty sentiments, and can express them gracefully.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;What, Sir, a fellow who claps a hump on his back, and a lump on his leg, and cries &ldquo;I am Richard the Third&rdquo;? Nay, Sir, a ballad-singer is a higher man, for he does two things; he repeats and he sings: there is both recitation and musick in his performance: the player only recites.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;My dear Sir! you may turn anything into ridicule. I allow, that a player of farce is not entitled to respect; he does a little thing: but he who can represent exalted characters, and touch the noblest passions, has very respectable powers; and mankind have agreed in admiring great talents for the stage. We must consider, too, that a great player does what very few are capable to do: his art is a very rare faculty. WHO can repeat Hamlet&rsquo;s soliloquy, &ldquo;To be, or not to be,&rdquo; as Garrick does it?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Any body may. Jemmy, there (a boy about eight years old, who was in the room,) will do it as well in a week.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;No, no, Sir: and as a proof of the merit of great acting, and of the value which mankind set upon it, Garrick has got a hundred thousand pounds.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Is getting a hundred thousand pounds a proof of excellence? That has been done by a scoundrel commissary.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">This was most fallacious reasoning. I was SURE, for once, that I had the best side of the argument. I boldly maintained the just distinction between a tragedian and a mere theatrical droll; between those who rouse our terrour and pity, and those who only make us laugh. &lsquo;If (said I,) Betterton and Foote were to walk into this room, you would respect Betterton much more than Foote.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;If Betterton were to walk into this room with Foote, Foote would soon drive him out of it. Foote, Sir, quatenus Foote, has powers superiour to them all.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Monday, September 22, when at breakfast, I unguardedly said to Dr. Johnson, &lsquo;I wish I saw you and Mrs. Macaulay together.&rsquo; He grew very angry; and, after a pause, while a cloud gathered on his brow, he burst out, &lsquo;No, Sir; you would not see us quarrel, to make you sport. Don&rsquo;t you know that it is very uncivil to PIT two people against one another?&rsquo; Then, checking himself, and wishing to be more gentle, he added, &lsquo;I do not say you should be hanged or drowned for this; but it IS very uncivil.&rsquo; Dr. Taylor thought him in the wrong, and spoke to him privately of it; but I afterwards acknowledged to Johnson that I was to blame, for I candidly owned, that I meant to express a desire to see a contest between Mrs. Macaulay and him; but then I knew how the contest would end; so that I was to see him triumph. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, you cannot be sure how a contest will end; and no man has a right to engage two people in a dispute by which their passions may be inflamed, and they may part with bitter resentment against each other. I would sooner keep company with a man from whom I must guard my pockets, than with a man who contrives to bring me into a dispute with somebody that he may hear it. This is the great fault of &mdash;&mdash;&nbsp; &mdash; ,(naming one of our friends,) endeavouring to introduce a subject upon which he knows two people in the company differ.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;But he told me, Sir, he does it for instruction.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Whatever the motive be, Sir, the man who does so, does very wrong. He has no more right to instruct himself at such risk, than he has to make two people fight a duel, that he may learn how to defend himself.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He found great fault with a gentleman of our acquaintance for keeping a bad table. &lsquo;Sir, (said he,) when a man is invited to dinner, he is disappointed if he does not get something good. I advised Mrs. Thrale, who has no card-parties at her house, to give sweet-meats, and such good things, in an evening, as are not commonly given, and she would find company enough come to her; for every body loves to have things which please the palate put in their way, without trouble or preparation.&rsquo; Such was his attention to the minutiae of life and manners.</p>
<p class="p24">Mr. Burke&rsquo;s Letter to the Sheriffs of Bristol, on the affairs of America, being mentioned, Johnson censured the composition much, and he ridiculed the definition of a free government, viz. &lsquo;For any practical purpose, it is what the people think so.&rsquo;&mdash; &lsquo;I will let the King of France govern me on those conditions, (said he,) for it is to be governed just as I please.&rsquo; And when Dr. Taylor talked of a girl being sent to a parish workhouse, and asked how much she could be obliged to work, &lsquo;Why, (said Johnson,) as much as is reasonable: and what is that? as much as SHE THINKS reasonable.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Dr. Johnson obligingly proposed to carry me to see Islam, a romantick scene, now belonging to a family of the name of Port, but formerly the seat of the Congreves. I suppose it is well described in some of the Tours. Johnson described it distinctly and vividly, at which I could not but express to him my wonder; because, though my eyes, as he observed, were better than his, I could not by any means equal him in representing visible objects. I said, the difference between us in this respect was as that between a man who has a bad instrument, but plays well on it, and a man who has a good instrument, on which he can play very imperfectly.</p>
<p class="p24">I recollect a very fine amphitheatre, surrounded with hills covered with woods, and walks neatly formed along the side of a rocky steep, on the quarter next the house with recesses under projections of rock, overshadowed with trees; in one of which recesses, we were told, Congreve wrote his Old Bachelor. We viewed a remarkable natural curiosity at Islam; two rivers bursting near each other from the rock, not from immediate springs, but after having run for many miles under ground. Plott, in his History of Staffordshire, gives an account of this curiosity; but Johnson would not believe it, though we had the attestation of the gardener, who said, he had put in corks, where the river Manyfold sinks into the ground, and had catched them in a net, placed before one of the openings where the water bursts out. Indeed, such subterraneous courses of water are found in various parts of our globe.</p>
<p class="p24">Talking of Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s unwillingness to believe extraordinary things I ventured to say, &lsquo;Sir, you come near Hume&rsquo;s argument against miracles, &ldquo;That it is more probable witnesses should lie, or be mistaken, than that they should happen.&rdquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, Hume, taking the proposition simply, is right. But the Christian revelation is not proved by the miracles alone, but as connected with prophecies, and with the doctrines in confirmation of which the miracles were wrought.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">In the evening, a gentleman-farmer, who was on a visit at Dr. Taylor&rsquo;s, attempted to dispute with Johnson in favour of Mungo Campbell, who shot Alexander, Earl of Eglintoune, upon his having fallen, when retreating from his Lordship, who he believed was about to seize his gun, as he had threatened to do. He said, he should have done just as Campbell did. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Whoever would do as Campbell did, deserves to be hanged; not that I could, as a juryman, have found him legally guilty of murder; but I am glad they found means to convict him.&rsquo; The gentleman-farmer said, &lsquo;A poor man has as much honour as a rich man; and Campbell had THAT to defend.&rsquo; Johnson exclaimed, &lsquo;A poor man has no honour.&rsquo; The English yeoman, not dismayed, proceeded: &lsquo;Lord Eglintoune was a damned fool to run on upon Campbell, after being warned that Campbell would shoot him if he did.&rsquo; Johnson, who could not bear any thing like swearing, angrily replied, &lsquo;He was NOT a DAMNED fool: he only thought too well of Campbell. He did not believe Campbell would be such a DAMNED scoundrel, as to do so DAMNED a thing.&rsquo; His emphasis on DAMNED, accompanied with frowning looks, reproved his opponent&rsquo;s want of decorum in HIS presence.</p>
<p class="p24">During this interview at Ashbourne, Johnson seemed to be more uniformly social, cheerful, and alert, than I had almost ever seen him. He was prompt on great occasions and on small. Taylor, who praised every thing of his own to excess; in short, &lsquo;whose geese were all swans,&rsquo; as the proverb says, expatiated on the excellence of his bull-dog, which, he told us, was &lsquo;perfectly well shaped.&rsquo; Johnson, after examining the animal attentively, thus repressed the vain-glory of our host:&mdash; &lsquo;No, Sir, he is NOT well shaped; for there is not the quick transition from the thickness of the fore-part, to the TENUITY &mdash; the thin part &mdash; behind, &mdash; which a bull-dog ought to have.&rsquo; This TENUITY was the only HARD WORD that I heard him use during this interview, and it will be observed, he instantly put another expression in its place. Taylor said, a small bull-dog was as good as a large one. JOHNSON. &lsquo;No, Sir; for, in proportion to his size, he has strength: and your argument would prove, that a good bull-dog may be as small as a mouse.&rsquo; It was amazing how he entered with perspicuity and keenness upon every thing that occurred in conversation. Most men, whom I know, would no more think of discussing a question about a bull-dog, than of attacking a bull.</p>
<p class="p24">I cannot allow any fragment whatever that floats in my memory concerning the great subject of this work to be lost. Though a small particular may appear trifling to some, it will be relished by others; while every little spark adds something to the general blaze: and to please the true, candid, warm admirers of Johnson, and in any degree increase the splendour of his reputation, I bid defiance to the shafts of ridicule, or even of malignity. Showers of them have been discharged at my Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides; yet it still sails unhurt along the stream of time, and, as an attendant upon Johnson,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Pursues the triumph, and partakes the gale.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">One morning after breakfast, when the sun shone bright, we walked out together, and &lsquo;pored&rsquo; for some time with placid indolence upon an artificial water-fall, which Dr. Taylor had made by building a strong dyke of stone across the river behind the garden. It was now somewhat obstructed by branches of trees and other rubbish, which had come down the river, and settled close to it. Johnson, partly from a desire to see it play more freely, and partly from that inclination to activity which will animate, at times, the most inert and sluggish mortal, took a long pole which was lying on a bank, and pushed down several parcels of this wreck with painful assiduity, while I stood quietly by, wondering to behold the sage thus curiously employed, and smiling with an humorous satisfaction each time when he carried his point. He worked till he was quite out of breath; and having found a large dead cat so heavy that he could not move it after several efforts, &lsquo;Come,&rsquo; said he, (throwing down the pole,) &lsquo;YOU shall take it now;&rsquo; which I accordingly did, and being a fresh man, soon made the cat tumble over the cascade. This may be laughed at as too trifling to record; but it is a small characteristick trait in the Flemish picture which I give of my friend, and in which, therefore I mark the most minute particulars. And let it be remembered, that Aesop at play is one of the instructive apologues of antiquity.</p>
<p class="p24">Talking of Rochester&rsquo;s Poems, he said, he had given them to Mr. Steevens to castrate for the edition of the poets, to which he was to write Prefaces. Dr. Taylor (the only time I ever heard him say any thing witty) observed, that if Rochester had been castrated himself, his exceptionable poems would not have been written.&rsquo; I asked if Burnet had not given a good Life of Rochester. JOHNSON. &lsquo;We have a good Death: there is not much Life.&rsquo; I asked whether Prior&rsquo;s Poems were to be printed entire: Johnson said they were. I mentioned Lord Hailes&rsquo;s censure of Prior, in his Preface to a collection of Sacred Poems, by various hands, published by him at Edinburgh a great many years ago, where he mentions, &lsquo;those impure tales which will be the eternal opprobrium of their ingenious authour.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, Lord Hailes has forgot. There is nothing in Prior that will excite to lewdness. If Lord Hailes thinks there is, he must be more combustible than other people.&rsquo; I instanced the tale of Paulo Purganti and his Wife. JOHNSON. Sir, there is nothing there, but that his wife wanted to be kissed when poor Paulo was out of pocket. No, Sir, Prior is a lady&rsquo;s book. No lady is ashamed to have it standing in her library.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">The hypochondriack disorder being mentioned, Dr. Johnson did not think it so common as I supposed. &lsquo;Dr. Taylor (said he,) is the same one day as another. Burke and Reynolds are the same; Beauclerk, except when in pain, is the same. I am not so myself; but this I do not mention commonly.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Dr. Johnson advised me to-day, to have as many books about me as I could; that I might read upon any subject upon which I had a desire for instruction at the time. &lsquo;What you read THEN (said he,) you will remember; but if you have not a book immediately ready, and the subject moulds in your mind, it is a chance if you again have a desire to study it.&rsquo; He added, &lsquo;If a man never has an eager desire for instruction, he should prescribe a task for himself. But it is better when a man reads from immediate inclination.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He repeated a good many lines of Horace&rsquo;s Odes, while we were in the chaise. I remember particularly the Ode Eheu fugaces.</p>
<p class="p24">He told me that Bacon was a favourite authour with him; but he had never read his works till he was compiling the English Dictionary, in which, he said, I might see Bacon very often quoted. Mr. Seward recollects his having mentioned, that a Dictionary of the English Language might be compiled from Bacon&rsquo;s writings alone, and that he had once an intention of giving an edition of Bacon, at least of his English works, and writing the Life of that great man. Had he executed this intention, there can be no doubt that he would have done it in a most masterly manner.</p>
<p class="p24">Wishing to be satisfied what degree of truth there was in a story which a friend of Johnson&rsquo;s and mine had told me to his disadvantage, I mentioned it to him in direct terms; and it was to this effect: that a gentleman who had lived in great intimacy with him, shewn him much kindness, and even relieved him from a spunging-house, having afterwards fallen into bad circumstances, was one day, when Johnson was at dinner with him, seized for debt, and carried to prison; that Johnson sat still undisturbed, and went on eating and drinking; upon which the gentleman&rsquo;s sister, who was present, could not suppress her indignation: &lsquo;What, Sir, (said she,) are you so unfeeling, as not even to offer to go to my brother in his distress; you who have been so much obliged to him?&rsquo; And that Johnson answered, &lsquo;Madam, I owe him no obligation; what he did for me he would have done for a dog.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson assured me, that the story was absolutely false: but like a man conscious of being in the right, and desirous of completely vindicating himself from such a charge, he did not arrogantly rest on a mere denial, and on his general character, but proceeded thus:&mdash; &lsquo;Sir, I was very intimate with that gentleman, and was once relieved by him from an arrest; but I never was present when he was arrested, never knew that he was arrested, and I believe he never was in difficulties after the time when he relieved me. I loved him much; yet, in talking of his general character, I may have said, though I do not remember that I ever did say so, that as his generosity proceeded from no principle, but was a part of his profusion, he would do for a dog what he would do for a friend: but I never applied this remark to any particular instance, and certainly not to his kindness to me. If a profuse man, who does not value his money, and gives a large sum to a whore, gives half as much, or an equally large sum to relieve a friend, it cannot be esteemed as virtue. This was all that I could say of that gentleman; and, if said at all, it must have been said after his death. Sir, I would have gone to the world&rsquo;s end to relieve him. The remark about the dog, if made by me, was such a sally as might escape one when painting a man highly.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Tuesday, September 23, Johnson was remarkably cordial to me. It being necessary for me to return to Scotland soon, I had fixed on the next day for my setting out, and I felt a tender concern at the thought of parting with him. He had, at this time, frankly communicated to me many particulars, which are inserted in this work in their proper places; and once, when I happened to mention that the expence of my jaunt would come to much more than I had computed, he said, &lsquo;Why, Sir, if the expence were to be an inconvenience, you would have reason to regret it: but, if you have had the money to spend, I know not that you could have purchased as much pleasure with it in any other way.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I perceived that he pronounced the word heard, as if spelt with a double e, heerd, instead of sounding it herd, as is most usually done. He said, his reason was, that if it was pronounced herd, there would be a single exception from the English pronunciation of the syllable ear, and he thought it better not to have that exception.</p>
<p class="p24">In the evening our gentleman-farmer, and two others, entertained themselves and the company with a great number of tunes on the fiddle. Johnson desired to have &lsquo;Let ambition fire thy mind,&rsquo; played over again, and appeared to give a patient attention to it; though he owned to me that he was very insensible to the power of musick. I told him, that it affected me to such a degree, as often to agitate my nerves painfully, producing in my mind alternate sensations of pathetick dejection, so that I was ready to shed tears; and of daring resolution, so that I was inclined to rush into the thickest part of the battle. &lsquo;Sir, (said he,) I should never hear it, if it made me such a fool.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">This evening, while some of the tunes of ordinary composition were played with no great skill, my frame was agitated, and I was conscious of a generous attachment to Dr. Johnson, as my preceptor and friend, mixed with an affectionate regret that he was an old man, whom I should probably lose in a short time. I thought I could defend him at the point of my sword. My reverence and affection for him were in full glow. I said to him, &lsquo;My dear Sir, we must meet every year, if you don&rsquo;t quarrel with me.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Nay, Sir, you are more likely to quarrel with me, than I with you. My regard for you is greater almost than I have words to express; but I do not choose to be always repeating it; write it down in the first leaf of your pocket-book, and never doubt of it again.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I talked to him of misery being &lsquo;the doom of man&rsquo; in this life, as displayed in his Vanity of Human Wishes. Yet I observed that things were done upon the supposition of happiness; grand houses were built, fine gardens were made, splendid places of publick amusement were contrived, and crowded with company. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Alas, Sir, these are all only struggles for happiness. When I first entered Ranelagh, it gave an expansion and gay sensation to my mind, such as I never experienced any where else. But, as Xerxes wept when he viewed his immense army, and considered that not one of that great multitude would be alive a hundred years afterwards, so it went to my heart to consider that there was not one in all that brilliant circle, that was not afraid to go home and think; but that the thoughts of each individual there, would be distressing when alone.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I suggested, that being in love, and flattered with hopes of success; or having some favourite scheme in view for the next day, might prevent that wretchedness of which we had been talking. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, it may sometimes be so as you suppose; but my conclusion is in general but too true.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">While Johnson and I stood in calm conference by ourselves in Dr. Taylor&rsquo;s garden, at a pretty late hour in a serene autumn night, looking up to the heavens, I directed the discourse to the subject of a future state. My friend was in a placid and most benignant frame. &lsquo;Sir, (said he,) I do not imagine that all things will be made clear to us immediately after death, but that the ways of Providence will be explained to us very gradually.&rsquo; He talked to me upon this aweful and delicate question in a gentle tone, and as if afraid to be decisive.</p>
<p class="p24">After supper I accompanied him to his apartment, and at my request he dictated to me an argument in favour of the negro who was then claiming his liberty, in an action in the Court of Session in Scotland. He had always been very zealous against slavery in every form, in which I, with all deference, thought that he discovered &lsquo;a zeal without knowledge.&rsquo; Upon one occasion, when in company with some very grave men at Oxford, his toast was, &lsquo;Here&rsquo;s to the next insurrection of the negroes in the West Indies.&rsquo; His violent prejudice against our West Indian and American settlers appeared whenever there was an opportunity. Towards the conclusion of his Taxation no Tyranny, he says, &lsquo;how is it that we hear the loudest YELPS for liberty among the drivers of negroes?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">When I said now to Johnson, that I was afraid I kept him too late up. &lsquo;No, Sir, (said he,) I don&rsquo;t care though I sit all night with you.&rsquo; This was an animated speech from a man in his sixty-ninth year.</p>
<p class="p24">Had I been as attentive not to displease him as I ought to have been, I know not but this vigil might have been fulfilled; but I unluckily entered upon the controversy concerning the right of Great-Britain to tax America, and attempted to argue in favour of our fellow-subjects on the other side of the Atlantick. I insisted that America might be very well governed, and made to yield sufficient revenue by the means of INFLUENCE, as exemplified in Ireland, while the people might be pleased with the imagination of their participating of the British constitution, by having a body of representatives, without whose consent money could not be exacted from them. Johnson could not bear my thus opposing his avowed opinion, which he had exerted himself with an extreme degree of heat to enforce; and the violent agitation into which he was thrown, while answering, or rather reprimanding me, alarmed me so, that I heartily repented of my having unthinkingly introduced the subject. I myself, however, grew warm, and the change was great, from the calm state of philosophical discussion in which we had a little before been pleasingly employed.</p>
<p class="p24">We were fatigued by the contest, which was produced by my want of caution; and he was not then in the humour to slide into easy and cheerful talk. It therefore so happened, that we were after an hour or two very willing to separate and go to bed.</p>
<p class="p24">On Wednesday, September 24, I went into Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s room before he got up, and finding that the storm of the preceding night was quite laid, I sat down upon his bed-side, and he talked with as much readiness and good-humour as ever. He recommended to me to plant a considerable part of a large moorish farm which I had purchased, and he made several calculations of the expence and profit: for he delighted in exercising his mind on the science of numbers. He pressed upon me the importance of planting at the first in a very sufficient manner, quoting the saying &lsquo;In bello non licet bis errare:&rsquo; and adding, &lsquo;this is equally true in planting.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I spoke with gratitude of Dr. Taylor&rsquo;s hospitality; and, as evidence that it was not on account of his good table alone that Johnson visited him often, I mentioned a little anecdote which had escaped my friend&rsquo;s recollection, and at hearing which repeated, he smiled. One evening, when I was sitting with him, Frank delivered this message: &lsquo;Sir, Dr. Taylor sends his compliments to you, and begs you will dine with him to-morrow. He has got a hare.&rsquo;&mdash; &lsquo;My compliments (said Johnson,) and I&rsquo;ll dine with him &mdash; hare or rabbit.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">After breakfast I departed, and pursued my journey northwards. I took my post-chaise from the Green Man, a very good inn at Ashbourne, the mistress of which, a mighty civil gentlewoman, courtseying very low, presented me with an engraving of the sign of her house; to which she had subjoined, in her own hand-writing, an address in such singular simplicity of style, that I have preserved it pasted upon one of the boards of my original Journal at this time, and shall here insert it for the amusement of my readers: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;M. KILLINGLEY&rsquo;s duty waits upon Mr. Boswell, is exceedingly obliged to him for this favour; whenever he comes this way, hopes for a continuance of the same. Would Mr. Boswell name the house to his extensive acquaintance, it would be a singular favour conferr&rsquo;d on one who has it not in her power to make any other return but her most grateful thanks, and sincerest prayers for his happiness in time, and in a blessed eternity. &mdash; Tuesday morn.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I cannot omit a curious circumstance which occurred at Edensor-inn, close by Chatsworth, to survey the magnificence of which I had gone a considerable way out of my road to Scotland. The inn was then kept by a very jolly landlord, whose name, I think, was Malton. He happened to mention that &lsquo;the celebrated Dr. Johnson had been in his house.&rsquo; I inquired WHO this Dr. Johnson was, that I might hear mine host&rsquo;s notion of him. &lsquo;Sir, (said he,) Johnson, the great writer; ODDITY, as they call him. He&rsquo;s the greatest writer in England; he writes for the ministry; he has a correspondence abroad, and lets them know what&rsquo;s going on.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">My friend, who had a thorough dependance upon the authenticity of my relation without any EMBELLISHMENT, as FALSEHOOD or FICTION is too gently called, laughed a good deal at this representation of himself.</p>
<p class="p24">On Wednesday, March 18,* I arrived in London, and was informed by good Mr. Francis that his master was better, and was gone to Mr. Thrale&rsquo;s at Streatham, to which place I wrote to him, begging to know when he would be in town. He was not expected for some time; but next day having called on Dr. Taylor, in Dean&rsquo;s-yard, Westminster, I found him there, and was told he had come to town for a few hours. He met me with his usual kindness, but instantly returned to the writing of something on which he was employed when I came in, and on which he seemed much intent. Finding him thus engaged, I made my visit very short.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* 1778.</p>
<p class="p24">On Friday, March 20, I found him at his own house, sitting with Mrs. Williams, and was informed that the room formerly allotted to me was now appropriated to a charitable purpose; Mrs. Desmoulins, and I think her daughter, and a Miss Carmichael, being all lodged in it. Such was his humanity, and such his generosity, that Mrs. Desmoulins herself told me, he allowed her half-a-guinea a week. Let it be remembered, that this was above a twelfth part of his pension.</p>
<p class="p24">His liberality, indeed, was at all periods of his life very remarkable. Mr. Howard, of Lichfield, at whose father&rsquo;s house Johnson had in his early years been kindly received, told me, that when he was a boy at the Charter-House, his father wrote to him to go and pay a visit to Mr. Samuel Johnson, which he accordingly did, and found him in an upper room, of poor appearance. Johnson received him with much courteousness, and talked a great deal to him, as to a school-boy, of the course of his education, and other particulars. When he afterwards came to know and understand the high character of this great man, he recollected his condescension with wonder. He added, that when he was going away, Mr. Johnson presented him with half-a-guinea; and this, said Mr. Howard, was at a time when he probably had not another.</p>
<p class="p24">We retired from Mrs. Williams to another room. Tom Davies soon after joined us. He had now unfortunately failed in his circumstances, and was much indebted to Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s kindness for obtaining for him many alleviations of his distress. After he went away, Johnson blamed his folly in quitting the stage, by which he and his wife got five hundred pounds a year. I said, I believed it was owing to Churchill&rsquo;s attack upon him,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;He mouths a sentence, as curs mouth a bone.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">JOHNSON. &lsquo;I believe so too, Sir. But what a man is he, who is to be driven from the stage by a line? Another line would have driven him from his shop.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He returned next day to Streatham, to Mr. Thrale&rsquo;s; where, as Mr. Strahan once complained to me, &lsquo;he was in a great measure absorbed from the society of his old friends.&rsquo; I was kept in London by business, and wrote to him on the 27th, that a separation from him for a week, when we were so near, was equal to a separation for a year, when we were at four hundred miles distance. I went to Streatham on Monday, March 30. Before he appeared, Mrs. Thrale made a very characteristical remark:&mdash; &lsquo;I do not know for certain what will please Dr. Johnson: but I know for certain that it will displease him to praise any thing, even what he likes, extravagantly.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">At dinner he laughed at querulous declamations against the age, on account of luxury, &mdash; increase of London, &mdash; scarcity of provisions, &mdash; and other such topicks. &lsquo;Houses (said he,) will be built till rents fall: and corn is more plentiful now than ever it was.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I had before dinner repeated a ridiculous story told me by an old man who had been a passenger with me in the stage-coach to-day. Mrs. Thrale, having taken occasion to allude to it in talking to me, called it &lsquo;The story told you by the old WOMAN.&rsquo;&mdash; &lsquo;Now, Madam, (said I,) give me leave to catch you in the fact; it was not an old WOMAN, but an old MAN, whom I mentioned as having told me this.&rsquo; I presumed to take an opportunity, in presence of Johnson, of shewing this lively lady how ready she was, unintentionally, to deviate from exact authenticity of narration.</p>
<p class="p24">Next morning, while we were at breakfast, Johnson gave a very earnest recommendation of what he himself practised with the utmost conscientiousness: I mean a strict attention to truth, even in the most minute particulars. &lsquo;Accustom your children (said he,) constantly to this; if a thing happened at one window, and they, when relating it, say that it happened at another, do not let it pass, but instantly check them; you do not know where deviation from truth will end.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;It may come to the door: and when once an account is at all varied in one circumstance, it may by degrees be varied so as to be totally different from what really happened.&rsquo; Our lively hostess, whose fancy was impatient of the rein, fidgeted at this, and ventured to say, &lsquo;Nay, this is too much. If Mr. Johnson should forbid me to drink tea, I would comply, as I should feel the restraint only twice a day; but little variations in narrative must happen a thousand times a day, if one is not perpetually watching.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Well, Madam, and you OUGHT to be perpetually watching. It is more from carelessness about truth than from intentional lying, that there is so much falsehood in the world.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He was indeed so much impressed with the prevalence of falsehood, voluntary or unintentional, that I never knew any person who upon hearing an extraordinary circumstance told, discovered more of the incredulus odi. He would say, with a significant look and decisive tone, &lsquo;It is not so. Do not tell this again.&rsquo; He inculcated upon all his friends the importance of perpetual vigilance against the slightest degrees of falsehood; the effect of which, as Sir Joshua Reynolds observed to me, has been, that all who were of his SCHOOL are distinguished for a love of truth and accuracy, which they would not have possessed in the same degree, if they had not been acquainted with Johnson.</p>
<p class="p24">Talking of ghosts, he said, &lsquo;It is wonderful that five thousand years have now elapsed since the creation of the world, and still it is undecided whether or not there has ever been an instance of the spirit of any person appearing after death. All argument is against it; but all belief is for it.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He said, &lsquo;John Wesley&rsquo;s conversation is good, but he is never at leisure. He is always obliged to go at a certain hour. This is very disagreeable to a man who loves to fold his legs and have out his talk, as I do.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Friday, April 3, I dined with him in London, in a company* where were present several eminent men, whom I shall not name, but distinguish their parts in the conversation by different letters.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* The Club.&nbsp; Hill identifies E. as Burke and J. as Sir</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joshua Reynolds. &mdash; ED.</p>
<p class="p24">E. &lsquo;We hear prodigious complaints at present of emigration. I am convinced that emigration makes a country more populous.&rsquo; J. &lsquo;That sounds very much like a paradox.&rsquo; E. &lsquo;Exportation of men, like exportation of all other commodities, makes more be produced.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;But there would be more people were there not emigration, provided there were food for more.&rsquo; E. &lsquo;No; leave a few breeders, and you&rsquo;ll have more people than if there were no emigration.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Nay, Sir, it is plain there will be more people, if there are more breeders. Thirty cows in good pasture will produce more calves than ten cows, provided they have good bulls.&rsquo; E. &lsquo;There are bulls enough in Ireland.&rsquo; JOHNSON. (smiling,) &lsquo;So, Sir, I should think from your argument.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">E. &lsquo;I believe, in any body of men in England, I should have been in the Minority; I have always been in the Minority.&rsquo; P. &lsquo;The House of Commons resembles a private company. How seldom is any man convinced by another&rsquo;s argument; passion and pride rise against it.&rsquo; R. &lsquo;What would be the consequence, if a Minister, sure of a majority in the House of Commons, should resolve that there should be no speaking at all upon his side.&rsquo; E. &lsquo;He must soon go out. That has been tried; but it was found it would not do.&rsquo; . . . .</p>
<p class="p24">JOHNSON. &lsquo;I have been reading Thicknesse&rsquo;s Travels, which I think are entertaining.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;What, Sir, a good book?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Yes, Sir, to read once; I do not say you are to make a study of it, and digest it; and I believe it to be a true book in his intention.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">E. &lsquo;From the experience which I have had, &mdash; and I have had a great deal, &mdash; I have learnt to think BETTER of mankind.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;From my experience I have found them worse in commercial dealings, more disposed to cheat, than I had any notion of; but more disposed to do one another good than I had conceived.&rsquo; J. &lsquo;Less just and more beneficent.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;And really it is wonderful, considering how much attention is necessary for men to take care of themselves, and ward off immediate evils which press upon them, it is wonderful how much they do for others. As it is said of the greatest liar, that he tells more truth than falsehood; so it may be said of the worst man, that he does more good than evil.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Perhaps from experience men may be found HAPPIER than we suppose.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;No, Sir; the more we enquire, we shall find men the less happy.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">E. &lsquo;I understand the hogshead of claret, which this society was favoured with by our friend the Dean, is nearly out; I think he should be written to, to send another of the same kind. Let the request be made with a happy ambiguity of expression, so that we may have the chance of his sending IT also as a present.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;I am willing to offer my services as secretary on this occasion.&rsquo; P. &lsquo;As many as are for Dr. Johnson being secretary hold up your hands. &mdash; Carried unanimously.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;He will be our Dictator.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;No, the company is to dictate to me. I am only to write for wine; and I am quite disinterested, as I drink none; I shall not be suspected of having forged the application. I am no more than humble SCRIBE.&rsquo; E. &lsquo;Then you shall PREscribe.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Very well. The first play of words to-day.&rsquo; J. &lsquo;No, no; the BULLS in Ireland.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Were I your Dictator you should have no wine. It would be my business cavere ne quid detrimenti Respublica caperet, and wine is dangerous. Rome was ruined by luxury,&rsquo; (smiling.) E. &lsquo;If you allow no wine as Dictator, you shall not have me for your master of horse.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Saturday, April 4, I drank tea with Johnson at Dr. Taylor&rsquo;s, where he had dined.</p>
<p class="p24">He was very silent this evening; and read in a variety of books: suddenly throwing down one, and taking up another.</p>
<p class="p24">He talked of going to Streatham that night. TAYLOR. &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll be robbed if you do: or you must shoot a highwayman. Now I would rather be robbed than do that; I would not shoot a highwayman.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;But I would rather shoot him in the instant when he is attempting to rob me, than afterwards swear against him at the Old-Bailey, to take away his life, after he has robbed me. I am surer I am right in the one case than in the other. I may be mistaken as to the man, when I swear: I cannot be mistaken, if I shoot him in the act. Besides, we feel less reluctance to take away a man&rsquo;s life, when we are heated by the injury, than to do it at a distance of time by an oath, after we have cooled.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;So, Sir, you would rather act from the motive of private passion, than that of publick advantage.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Nay, Sir, when I shoot the highwayman I act from both.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Very well, very well &mdash; There is no catching him.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;At the same time one does not know what to say. For perhaps one may, a year after, hang himself from uneasiness for having shot a man. Few minds are fit to be trusted with so great a thing.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Then, Sir, you would not shoot him?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;But I might be vexed afterwards for that too.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Thrale&rsquo;s carriage not having come for him, as he expected, I accompanied him some part of the way home to his own house. I told him, that I had talked of him to Mr. Dunning a few days before, and had said, that in his company we did not so much interchange conversation, as listen to him; and that Dunning observed, upon this, &lsquo;One is always willing to listen to Dr. Johnson:&rsquo; to which I answered, &lsquo;That is a great deal from you, Sir.&rsquo;&mdash; &lsquo;Yes, Sir, (said Johnson,) a great deal indeed. Here is a man willing to listen, to whom the world is listening all the rest of the year.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;I think, Sir, it is right to tell one man of such a handsome thing, which has been said of him by another. It tends to increase benevolence.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Undoubtedly it is right, Sir.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Tuesday, April 7, I breakfasted with him at his house. He said, &lsquo;nobody was content.&rsquo; I mentioned to him a respectable person in Scotland whom he knew; and I asserted, that I really believed he was always content. JOHNSON. &lsquo;No, Sir, he is not content with the present; he has always some new scheme, some new plantation, something which is future. You know he was not content as a widower; for he married again.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;But he is not restless.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, he is only locally at rest. A chymist is locally at rest; but his mind is hard at work. This gentleman has done with external exertions. It is too late for him to engage in distant projects.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;He seems to amuse himself quite well; to have his attention fixed, and his tranquillity preserved by very small matters. I have tried this; but it would not do with me.&rsquo; JOHNSON. (laughing,) &lsquo;No, Sir; it must be born with a man to be contented to take up with little things. Women have a great advantage that they may take up with little things, without disgracing themselves: a man cannot, except with fiddling. Had I learnt to fiddle, I should have done nothing else.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Pray, Sir, did you ever play on any musical instrument?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;No, Sir. I once bought me a flagelet; but I never made out a tune.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;A flagelet, Sir! &mdash; so small an instrument? I should have liked to hear you play on the violoncello. THAT should have been YOUR instrument.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, I might as well have played on the violoncello as another; but I should have done nothing else. No, Sir; a man would never undertake great things, could he be amused with small. I once tried knotting. Dempster&rsquo;s sister undertook to teach me; but I could not learn it.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;So, Sir; it will be related in pompous narrative, &ldquo;Once for his amusement he tried knotting; nor did this Hercules disdain the distaff.&rdquo;&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Knitting of stockings is a good amusement. As a freeman of Aberdeen I should be a knitter of stockings.&rsquo; He asked me to go down with him and dine at Mr. Thrale&rsquo;s at Streatham, to which I agreed. I had lent him An Account of Scotland, in 1702, written by a man of various enquiry, an English chaplain to a regiment stationed there. JOHNSON. &lsquo;It is sad stuff, Sir, miserably written, as books in general then were. There is now an elegance of style universally diffused. No man now writes so ill as Martin&rsquo;s Account of the Hebrides is written. A man could not write so ill, if he should try. Set a merchant&rsquo;s clerk now to write, and he&rsquo;ll do better.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He talked to me with serious concern of a certain female friend&rsquo;s &lsquo;laxity of narration, and inattention to truth.&rsquo;&mdash; &lsquo;I am as much vexed (said he,) at the ease with which she hears it mentioned to her, as at the thing itself. I told her, &ldquo;Madam, you are contented to hear every day said to you, what the highest of mankind have died for, rather than bear.&rdquo; &mdash; You know, Sir, the highest of mankind have died rather than bear to be told they had uttered a falsehood. Do talk to her of it: I am weary.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">BOSWELL. &lsquo;Was not Dr. John Campbell a very inaccurate man in his narrative, Sir? He once told me, that he drank thirteen bottles of port at a sitting.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, I do not know that Campbell ever lied with pen and ink; but you could not entirely depend on any thing he told you in conversation: if there was fact mixed with it. However, I loved Campbell: he was a solid orthodox man: he had a reverence for religion. Though defective in practice, he was religious in principle; and he did nothing grossly wrong that I have heard.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Talking of drinking wine, he said, &lsquo;I did not leave off wine, because I could not bear it; I have drunk three bottles of port without being the worse for it. University College has witnessed this.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Why, then, Sir, did you leave it off?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, because it is so much better for a man to be sure that he is never to be intoxicated, never to lose the power over himself. I shall not begin to drink wine again, till I grow old, and want it.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;I think, Sir, you once said to me, that not to drink wine was a great deduction from life.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;It is a diminution of pleasure, to be sure; but I do not say a diminution of happiness. There is more happiness in being rational.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;But if we could have pleasure always, should not we be happy? The greatest part of men would compound for pleasure.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Supposing we could have pleasure always, an intellectual man would not compound for it. The greatest part of men would compound, because the greatest part of men are gross.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I mentioned to him that I had become very weary in a company where I heard not a single intellectual sentence, except that &lsquo;a man who had been settled ten years in Minorca was become a much inferiour man to what he was in London, because a man&rsquo;s mind grows narrow in a narrow place.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;A man&rsquo;s mind grows narrow in a narrow place, whose mind is enlarged only because he has lived in a large place: but what is got by books and thinking is preserved in a narrow place as well as in a large place. A man cannot know modes of life as well in Minorca as in London; but he may study mathematicks as well in Minorca.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know, Sir: if you had remained ten years in the Isle of Col, you would not have been the man that you now are.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Yes, Sir, if I had been there from fifteen to twenty-five; but not if from twenty-five to thirty-five.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;I own, Sir, the spirits which I have in London make me do every thing with more readiness and vigour. I can talk twice as much in London as any where else.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Of Goldsmith he said, &lsquo;He was not an agreeable companion, for he talked always for fame. A man who does so never can be pleasing. The man who talks to unburthen his mind is the man to delight you. An eminent friend of ours is not so agreeable as the variety of his knowledge would otherwise make him, because he talks partly from ostentation.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Soon after our arrival at Thrale&rsquo;s, I heard one of the maids calling eagerly on another, to go to Dr. Johnson. I wondered what this could mean. I afterwards learnt, that it was to give her a Bible, which he had brought from London as a present to her.</p>
<p class="p24">He was for a considerable time occupied in reading Memoires de Fontenelle, leaning and swinging upon the low gate into the court, without his hat.</p>
<p class="p24">At dinner, Mrs. Thrale expressed a wish to go and see Scotland. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Seeing Scotland, Madam, is only seeing a worse England. It is seeing the flower gradually fade away to the naked stalk. Seeing the Hebrides, indeed, is seeing quite a different scene.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Thursday, April 9, I dined with him at Sir Joshua Reynolds&rsquo;s, with the Bishop of St. Asaph, (Dr. Shipley,) Mr. Allan Ramsay, Mr. Gibbon, Mr. Cambridge, and Mr. Langton.</p>
<p class="p24">Goldsmith being mentioned, Johnson observed, that it was long before his merit came to be acknowledged. That he once complained to him, in ludicrous terms of distress, &lsquo;Whenever I write any thing, the publick MAKE A POINT to know nothing about it:&rsquo; but that his Traveller brought him into high reputation. LANGTON. &lsquo;There is not one bad line in that poem; not one of Dryden&rsquo;s careless verses. SIR JOSHUA. &lsquo;I was glad to hear Charles Fox say, it was one of the finest poems in the English language.&rsquo; LANGTON. &lsquo;Why was you glad? You surely had no doubt of this before.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;No; the merit of The Traveller is so well established, that Mr. Fox&rsquo;s praise cannot augment it, nor his censure diminish it.&rsquo; SIR JOSHUA. &lsquo;But his friends may suspect they had too great a partiality for him.&rsquo; JOHNSON. Nay, Sir, the partiality of his friends was always against him. It was with difficulty we could give him a hearing. Goldsmith had no settled notions upon any subject; so he talked always at random. It seemed to be his intention to blurt out whatever was in his mind, and see what would become of it. He was angry too, when catched in an absurdity; but it did not prevent him from falling into another the next minute. I remember Chamier, after talking with him for some time, said, &ldquo;Well, I do believe he wrote this poem himself: and, let me tell you, that is believing a great deal.&rdquo; Chamier once asked him, what he meant by slow, the last word in the first line of The Traveller,</p>
<p class="p24">&ldquo;Remote, unfriended, melancholy, slow.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Did he mean tardiness of locomotion? Goldsmith, who would say something without consideration, answered, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; I was sitting by, and said, &ldquo;No, Sir; you do not mean tardiness of locomotion; you mean, that sluggishness of mind which comes upon a man in solitude.&rdquo; Chamier believed then that I had written the line as much as if he had seen me write it. Goldsmith, however, was a man, who, whatever he wrote, did it better than any other man could do. He deserved a place in Westminster-Abbey, and every year he lived, would have deserved it better. He had, indeed, been at no pains to fill his mind with knowledge. He transplanted it from one place to another; and it did not settle in his mind; so he could not tell what was in his own books.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">We talked of living in the country. JOHNSON. &lsquo;No wise man will go to live in the country, unless he has something to do which can be better done in the country. For instance: if he is to shut himself up for a year to study a science, it is better to look out to the fields, than to an opposite wall. Then, if a man walks out in the country, there is nobody to keep him from walking in again: but if a man walks out in London, he is not sure when he shall walk in again. A great city is, to be sure, the school for studying life; and &ldquo;The proper study of mankind is man,&rdquo; as Pope observes.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;I fancy London is the best place for society; though I have heard that the very first society of Paris is still beyond any thing that we have here.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, I question if in Paris such a company as is sitting round this table could be got together in less than half a year. They talk in France of the felicity of men and women living together: the truth is, that there the men are not higher than the women, they know no more than the women do, and they are not held down in their conversation by the presence of women.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">We talked of old age. Johnson (now in his seventieth year,) said, &lsquo;It is a man&rsquo;s own fault, it is from want of use, if his mind grows torpid in old age.&rsquo; The Bishop asked, if an old man does not lose faster than he gets. JOHNSON. &lsquo;I think not, my Lord, if he exerts himself.&rsquo; One of the company rashly observed, that he thought it was happy for an old man that insensibility comes upon him. JOHNSON. (with a noble elevation and disdain,) &lsquo;No, Sir, I should never be happy by being less rational.&rsquo; BISHOP OF ST. ASAPH. &lsquo;Your wish then, Sir, is [Greek text omitted].&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Yes, my Lord.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">This season there was a whimsical fashion in the newspapers of applying Shakspeare&rsquo;s words to describe living persons well known in the world; which was done under the title of Modern Characters from Shakspeare; many of which were admirably adapted. The fancy took so much, that they were afterwards collected into a pamphlet. Somebody said to Johnson, across the table, that he had not been in those characters. &lsquo;Yes (said he,) I have. I should have been sorry to be left out.&rsquo; He then repeated what had been applied to him,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I must borrow GARAGANTUA&rsquo;S mouth.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Miss Reynolds not perceiving at once the meaning of this, he was obliged to explain it to her, which had something of an aukward and ludicrous effect. &lsquo;Why, Madam, it has a reference to me, as using big words, which require the mouth of a giant to pronounce them. Garagantua is the name of a giant in Rabelais.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;But, Sir, there is another amongst them for you:</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;He would not flatter Neptune for his trident,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or Jove for his power to thunder.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">JOHNSON. &lsquo;There is nothing marked in that. No, Sir, Garagantua is the best.&rsquo; Notwithstanding this ease and good humour, when I, a little while afterwards, repeated his sarcasm on Kenrick, which was received with applause, he asked, &lsquo;WHO said that?&rsquo; and on my suddenly answering, Garagantua, he looked serious, which was a sufficient indication that he did not wish it to be kept up.</p>
<p class="p24">When we went to the drawing-room there was a rich assemblage. Besides the company who had been at dinner, there were Mr. Garrick, Mr. Harris of Salisbury, Dr. Percy, Dr. Burney, Honourable Mrs. Cholmondeley, Miss Hannah More, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
<p class="p24">After wandering about in a kind of pleasing distraction for some time, I got into a corner, with Johnson, Garrick, and Harris. GARRICK. (to Harris,) &lsquo;Pray, Sir, have you read Potter&rsquo;s Aeschylus?&rsquo; HARRIS. &lsquo;Yes; and think it pretty.&rsquo; GARRICK. (to Johnson,) &lsquo;And what think you, Sir, of it?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;I thought what I read of it VERBIAGE: but upon Mr. Harris&rsquo;s recommendation, I will read a play. (To Mr. Harris,) Don&rsquo;t prescribe two.&rsquo; Mr. Harris suggested one, I do not remember which. JOHNSON. &lsquo;We must try its effect as an English poem; that is the way to judge of the merit of a translation. Translations are, in general, for people who cannot read the original.&rsquo; I mentioned the vulgar saying, that Pope&rsquo;s Homer was not a good representation of the original. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, it is the greatest work of the kind that has ever been produced.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;The truth is, it is impossible perfectly to translate poetry. In a different language it may be the same tune, but it has not the same tone. Homer plays it on a bassoon; Pope on a flagelet.&rsquo; HARRIS. &lsquo;I think Heroick poetry is best in blank verse; yet it appears that rhyme is essential to English poetry, from our deficiency in metrical quantities. In my opinion, the chief excellence of our language is numerous prose.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir William Temple was the first writer who gave cadence to English prose. Before his time they were careless of arrangement, and did not mind whether a sentence ended with an important word or an insignificant word, or with what part of speech it was concluded.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">GARRICK. &lsquo;Of all the translations that ever were attempted, I think Elphinston&rsquo;s Martial the most extraordinary. He consulted me upon it, who am a little of an epigrammatist myself, you know. I told him freely, &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t seem to have that turn.&rdquo; I asked him if he was serious; and finding he was, I advised him against publishing. Why, his translation is more difficult to understand than the original. I thought him a man of some talents; but he seems crazy in this.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, you have done what I had not courage to do. But he did not ask my advice, and I did not force it upon him, to make him angry with me.&rsquo; GARRICK. &lsquo;But as a friend, Sir &mdash; .&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, such a friend as I am with him &mdash; no.&rsquo; GARRICK. &lsquo;But if you see a friend going to tumble over a precipice?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;That is an extravagant case, Sir. You are sure a friend will thank you for hindering him from tumbling over a precipice; but, in the other case, I should hurt his vanity, and do him no good. He would not take my advice. His brother-in-law, Strahan, sent him a subscription of fifty pounds, and said he would send him fifty more, if he would not publish.&rsquo; GARRICK. &lsquo;What! eh! is Strahan a good judge of an Epigram? Is not he rather an OBTUSE man, eh?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, he may not be a judge of an Epigram: but you see he is a judge of what is not an Epigram.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;It is easy for you, Mr. Garrick, to talk to an authour as you talked to Elphinston; you, who have been so long the manager of a theatre, rejecting the plays of poor authours. You are an old Judge, who have often pronounced sentence of death. You are a practiced surgeon, who have often amputated limbs; and though this may have been for the good of your patients, they cannot like you. Those who have undergone a dreadful operation, are not very fond of seeing the operator again.&rsquo; GARRICK. &lsquo;Yes, I know enough of that. There was a reverend gentleman, (Mr. Hawkins,) who wrote a tragedy, the SIEGE of something, which I refused.&rsquo; HARRIS. &lsquo;So, the siege was raised.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Ay, he came to me and complained; and told me, that Garrick said his play was wrong in the CONCOCTION. Now, what is the concoction of a play?&rsquo; (Here Garrick started, and twisted himself, and seemed sorely vexed; for Johnson told me, he believed the story was true.) GARRICK. &lsquo;I &mdash; I &mdash; I &mdash; said FIRST concoction.&rsquo; JOHNSON. (smiling,) &lsquo;Well, he left out FIRST. And Rich, he said, refused him IN FALSE ENGLISH: he could shew it under his hand.&rsquo; GARRICK. &lsquo;He wrote to me in violent wrath, for having refused his play: &ldquo;Sir, this is growing a very serious and terrible affair. I am resolved to publish my play. I will appeal to the world; and how will your judgement appear?&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;Sir, notwithstanding all the seriousness, and all the terrours, I have no objection to your publishing your play; and as you live at a great distance, (Devonshire, I believe,) if you will send it to me, I will convey it to the press.&rdquo; I never heard more of it, ha! ha! ha!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Friday, April 10, I found Johnson at home in the morning. We resumed the conversation of yesterday. He put me in mind of some of it which had escaped my memory, and enabled me to record it more perfectly than I otherwise could have done. He was much pleased with my paying so great attention to his recommendation in 1763, the period when our acquaintance began, that I should keep a journal; and I could perceive he was secretly pleased to find so much of the fruit of his mind preserved; and as he had been used to imagine and say that he always laboured when he said a good thing &mdash; it delighted him, on a review, to find that his conversation teemed with point and imagery.</p>
<p class="p24">I said to him, &lsquo;You were yesterday, Sir, in remarkably good humour: but there was nothing to offend you, nothing to produce irritation or violence. There was no bold offender. There was not one capital conviction. It was a maiden assize. You had on your white gloves.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He found fault with our friend Langton for having been too silent. &lsquo;Sir, (said I,) you will recollect, that he very properly took up Sir Joshua for being glad that Charles Fox had praised Goldsmith&rsquo;s Traveller, and you joined him.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Yes, Sir, I knocked Fox on the head, without ceremony. Reynolds is too much under Fox and Burke at present. He is under the Fox star and the Irish constellation. He is always under some planet.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;There is no Fox star.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;But there is a dog star.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;They say, indeed, a fox and a dog are the same animal.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">We dined together with Mr. Scott (now Sir William Scott his Majesty&rsquo;s Advocate General,) at his chambers in the Temple, nobody else there. The company being small, Johnson was not in such spirits as he had been the preceding day, and for a considerable time little was said.</p>
<p class="p24">Talking of fame, for which there is so great a desire, I observed how little there is of it in reality, compared with the other objects of human attention. &lsquo;Let every man recollect, and he will be sensible how small a part of his time is employed in talking or thinking of Shakspeare, Voltaire, or any of the most celebrated men that have ever lived, or are now supposed to occupy the attention and admiration of the world. Let this be extracted and compressed; into what a narrow space will it go!&rsquo; I then slily introduced Mr. Garrick&rsquo;s fame, and his assuming the airs of a great man. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, it is wonderful how LITTLE Garrick assumes. No, Sir, Garrick fortunam reverenter habet. Consider, Sir: celebrated men, such as you have mentioned, have had their applause at a distance; but Garrick had it dashed in his face, sounded in his ears, and went home every night with the plaudits of a thousand in his CRANIUM. Then, Sir, Garrick did not FIND, but MADE his way to the tables, the levees, and almost the bed-chambers of the great. Then, Sir, Garrick had under him a numerous body of people; who, from fear of his power, and hopes of his favour, and admiration of his talents, were constantly submissive to him. And here is a man who has advanced the dignity of his profession. Garrick has made a player a higher character.&rsquo; SCOTT. &lsquo;And he is a very sprightly writer too.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Yes, Sir; and all this supported by great wealth of his own acquisition. If all this had happened to me, I should have had a couple of fellows with long poles walking before me, to knock down every body that stood in the way. Consider, if all this had happened to Cibber or Quin, they&rsquo;d have jumped over the moon &mdash; Yet Garrick speaks to US.&rsquo; (smiling.) BOSWELL. &lsquo;And Garrick is a very good man, a charitable man.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, a liberal man. He has given away more money than any man in England. There may be a little vanity mixed; but he has shewn, that money is not his first object.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Yet Foote used to say of him, that he walked out with an intention to do a generous action; but, turning the corner of a street, he met with the ghost of a half-penny, which frightened him.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, that is very true, too; for I never knew a man of whom it could be said with less certainty to-day, what he will do to-morrow, than Garrick; it depends so much on his humour at the time.&rsquo; SCOTT. &lsquo;I am glad to hear of his liberality. He has been represented as very saving.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;With his domestick saving we have nothing to do. I remember drinking tea with him long ago, when Peg Woffington made it, and he grumbled at her for making it too strong.* He had then begun to feel money in his purse, and did not know when he should have enough of it.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* When Johnson told this little anecdote to Sir Joshua</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reynolds, he mentioned a circumstance which he omitted</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to-day:&mdash; &lsquo;Why, (said Garrick,) it is as red as blood.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash; BOSWELL</p>
<p class="p24">We talked of war. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Every man thinks meanly of himself for not having been a soldier, or not having been at sea.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Lord Mansfield does not.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, if Lord Mansfield were in a company of General Officers and Admirals who have been in service, he would shrink; he&rsquo;d wish to creep under the table.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;No; he&rsquo;d think he could TRY them all.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Yes, if he could catch them: but they&rsquo;d try him much sooner. No, Sir; were Socrates and Charles the Twelfth of Sweden both present in any company, and Socrates to say, &ldquo;Follow me, and hear a lecture on philosophy;&rdquo; and Charles, laying his hand on his sword, to say, &ldquo;Follow me, and dethrone the Czar;&rdquo; a man would be ashamed to follow Socrates. Sir, the impression is universal; yet it is strange.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He talked of Mr. Charles Fox, of whose abilities he thought highly, but observed, that he did not talk much at our CLUB. I have heard Mr. Gibbon remark, &lsquo;that Mr. Fox could not be afraid of Dr. Johnson; yet he certainly was very shy of saying any thing in Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s presence.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He expressed great indignation at the imposture of the Cock-lane Ghost, and related, with much satisfaction, how he had assisted in detecting the cheat, and had published an account of it in the news-papers. Upon this subject I incautiously offended him, by pressing him with too many questions, and he shewed his displeasure. I apologised, saying that &lsquo;I asked questions in order to be instructed and entertained; I repaired eagerly to the fountain; but that the moment he gave me a hint, the moment he put a lock upon the well, I desisted.&rsquo;&mdash; &lsquo;But, Sir, (said he), that is forcing one to do a disagreeable thing:&rsquo; and he continued to rate me. &lsquo;Nay, Sir, (said I,) when you have put a lock upon the well, so that I can no longer drink, do not make the fountain of your wit play upon me and wet me.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He sometimes could not bear being teazed with questions. I was once present when a gentleman asked so many as, &lsquo;What did you do, Sir?&rsquo; &lsquo;What did you say, Sir?&rsquo; that he at last grew enraged, and said, &lsquo;I will not be put to the QUESTION. Don&rsquo;t you consider, Sir, that these are not the manners of a gentleman? I will not be baited with WHAT, and WHY; what is this? what is that? why is a cow&rsquo;s tail long? why is a fox&rsquo;s tail bushy?&rsquo; The gentleman, who was a good deal out of countenance, said, &lsquo;Why, Sir, you are so good, that I venture to trouble you.&rsquo; Johnson. &lsquo;Sir, my being so GOOD is no reason why you should be so ILL.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He talked with an uncommon animation of travelling into distant countries; that the mind was enlarged by it, and that an acquisition of dignity of character was derived from it. He expressed a particular enthusiasm with respect to visiting the wall of China. I catched it for the moment, and said I really believed I should go and see the wall of China had I not children, of whom it was my duty to take care. &lsquo;Sir, (said he,) by doing so, you would do what would be of importance in raising your children to eminence. There would be a lustre reflected upon them from your spirit and curiosity. They would be at all times regarded as the children of a man who had gone to view the wall of China. I am serious, Sir.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">When we had left Mr. Scott&rsquo;s, he said &lsquo;Will you go home with me?&rsquo; &lsquo;Sir, (said I,) it is late; but I&rsquo;ll go with you for three minutes.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Or four.&rsquo; We went to Mrs. Williams&rsquo;s room, where we found Mr. Allen the printer, who was the landlord of his house in Bolt-court, a worthy, obliging man, and his very old acquaintance; and what was exceedingly amusing, though he was of a very diminutive size, he used, even in Johnson&rsquo;s presence, to imitate the stately periods and slow and solemn utterance of the great man. &mdash; I this evening boasted, that although I did not write what is called stenography, or short-hand, in appropriated characters devised for the purpose, I had a method of my own of writing half words, and leaving out some altogether so as yet to keep the substance and language of any discourse which I had heard so much in view, that I could give it very completely soon after I had taken it down.</p>
<p class="p24">On Sunday, April 12, I found him at home before dinner. He and I, and Mrs. Williams, went to dine with the Reverend Dr. Percy.</p>
<p class="p24">And here I shall record a scene of too much heat between Dr. Johnson and Dr. Percy, which I should have suppressed, were it not that it gave occasion to display the truely tender and benevolent heart of Johnson, who, as soon as he found a friend was at all hurt by any thing which he had &lsquo;said in his wrath,&rsquo; was not only prompt and desirous to be reconciled, but exerted himself to make ample reparation.</p>
<p class="p24">Books of Travels having been mentioned, Johnson praised Pennant very highly, as he did at Dunvegan, in the Isle of Sky. Dr. Percy, knowing himself to be the heir male of the ancient Percies, and having the warmest and most dutiful attachment to the noble House of Northumberland, could not sit quietly and hear a man praised, who had spoken disrespectfully of Alnwick-Castle and the Duke&rsquo;s pleasure grounds, especially as he thought meanly of his travels. He therefore opposed Johnson eagerly. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Pennant in what he has said of Alnwick, has done what he intended; he has made you very angry.&rsquo; PERCY. &lsquo;He has said the garden is TRIM, which is representing it like a citizen&rsquo;s parterre, when the truth is, there is a very large extent of fine turf and gravel walks.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;According to your own account, Sir, Pennant is right. It IS trim. Here is grass cut close, and gravel rolled smooth. Is not that trim? The extent is nothing against that; a mile may be as trim as a square yard. Your extent puts me in mind of the citizen&rsquo;s enlarged dinner, two pieces of roast-beef, and two puddings. There is no variety, no mind exerted in laying out the ground, no trees.&rsquo; PERCY. &lsquo;He pretends to give the natural history of Northumberland, and yet takes no notice of the immense number of trees planted there of late.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;That, Sir, has nothing to do with the NATURAL history; that is CIVIL history. A man who gives the natural history of the oak, is not to tell how many oaks have been planted in this place or that. A man who gives the natural history of the cow, is not to tell how many cows are milked at Islington. The animal is the same, whether milked in the Park or at Islington.&rsquo; PERCY. &lsquo;Pennant does not describe well; a carrier who goes along the side of Loch-lomond would describe it better.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;I think he describes very well.&rsquo; PERCY. &lsquo;I travelled after him.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;And I travelled after him.&rsquo; PERCY. &lsquo;But, my good friend, you are short-sighted, and do not see so well as I do.&rsquo; I wondered at Dr. Percy&rsquo;s venturing thus. Dr. Johnson said nothing at the time; but inflammable particles were collecting for a cloud to burst. In a little while Dr. Percy said something more in disparagement of Pennant. JOHNSON. (pointedly,) &lsquo;This is the resentment of a narrow mind, because he did not find every thing in Northumberland.&rsquo; PERCY. (feeling the stroke,) &lsquo;Sir, you may be as rude as you please.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Hold, Sir! Don&rsquo;t talk of rudeness; remember, Sir, you told me (puffing hard with passion struggling for a vent,) I was shortsighted. We have done with civility. We are to be as rude as we please.&rsquo; PERCY. &lsquo;Upon my honour, Sir, I did not mean to be uncivil.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;I cannot say so, Sir; for I DID mean to be uncivil, thinking YOU had been uncivil.&rsquo; Dr. Percy rose, ran up to him, and taking him by the hand, assured him affectionately that his meaning had been misunderstood; upon which a reconciliation instantly took place. JOHNSON. &lsquo;My dear Sir, I am willing you shall HANG Pennant.&rsquo; PERCY. (resuming the former subject,) &lsquo;Pennant complains that the helmet is not hung out to invite to the hall of hospitality. Now I never heard that it was a custom to hang out a HELMET.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Hang him up, hang him up.&rsquo; BOSWELL. (humouring the joke,) &lsquo;Hang out his skull instead of a helmet, and you may drink ale out of it in your hall of Odin, as he is your enemy; that will be truly ancient. THERE will be Northern Antiquities.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;He&rsquo;s a WHIG, Sir; a SAD DOG. (smiling at his own violent expressions, merely for political difference of opinion.) But he&rsquo;s the best traveller I ever read; he observes more things than any one else does.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Monday, April 13, I dined with Johnson at Mr. Langton&rsquo;s, where were Dr. Porteus, then Bishop of Chester, now of London, and Dr. Stinton. He was at first in a very silent mood. Before dinner he said nothing but &lsquo;Pretty baby,&rsquo; to one of the children. Langton said very well to me afterwards, that he could repeat Johnson&rsquo;s conversation before dinner, as Johnson had said that he could repeat a complete chapter of The Natural History of Iceland, from the Danish of Horrebow, the whole of which was exactly thus: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;CHAP. LXXII. Concerning snakes.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;There are no snakes to be met with throughout the whole island.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Mr. Topham Beauclerk came in the evening, and he and Dr. Johnson and I staid to supper. It was mentioned that Dr. Dodd had once wished to be a member of THE LITERARY CLUB. JOHNSON. &lsquo;I should be sorry if any of our Club were hanged. I will not say but some of them deserve it.&rsquo; BEAUCLERK. (supposing this to be aimed at persons for whom he had at that time a wonderful fancy, which, however, did not last long,) was irritated, and eagerly said, &lsquo;You, Sir, have a friend, (naming him) who deserves to be hanged; for he speaks behind their backs against those with whom he lives on the best terms, and attacks them in the newspapers. HE certainly ought to be KICKED.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, we all do this in some degree, &ldquo;Veniam petimus damusque vicissim.&rdquo; To be sure it may be done so much, that a man may deserve to be kicked.&rsquo; BEAUCLERK. &lsquo;He is very malignant.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;No, Sir; he is not malignant. He is mischievous, if you will. He would do no man an essential injury; he may, indeed, love to make sport of people by vexing their vanity. I, however, once knew an old gentleman who was absolutely malignant. He really wished evil to others, and rejoiced at it.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;The gentleman, Mr. Beauclerk, against whom you are so violent, is, I know, a man of good principles.&rsquo; BEAUCLERK. &lsquo;Then he does not wear them out in practice.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Dr. Johnson, who, as I have observed before, delighted in discrimination of character, and having a masterly knowledge of human nature, was willing to take men as they are, imperfect and with a mixture of good and bad qualities, I suppose though he had said enough in defence of his friend, of whose merits, notwithstanding his exceptional points, he had a just value; and added no more on the subject.</p>
<p class="p24">On Wednesday, April 15, I dined with Dr. Johnson at Mr. Dilly&rsquo;s, and was in high spirits, for I had been a good part of the morning with Mr. Orme, the able and eloquent historian of Hindostan, who expressed a great admiration of Johnson. &lsquo;I do not care (said he,) on what subject Johnson talks; but I love better to hear him talk than any body. He either gives you new thoughts, or a new colouring. It is a shame to the nation that he has not been more liberally rewarded. Had I been George the Third, and thought as he did about America, I would have given Johnson three hundred a year for his Taxation no Tyranny alone.&rsquo; I repeated this, and Johnson was much pleased with such praise from such a man as Orme.</p>
<p class="p24">At Mr. Dilly&rsquo;s to-day were Mrs. Knowles, the ingenious Quaker lady, Miss Seward, the poetess of Lichfield, the Reverend Dr. Mayo, and the Rev. Mr. Beresford, Tutor to the Duke of Bedford. Before dinner Dr. Johnson seized upon Mr. Charles Sheridan&rsquo;s Account of the late Revolution in Sweden, and seemed to read it ravenously, as if he devoured it, which was to all appearance his method of studying. &lsquo;He knows how to read better than any one (said Mrs. Knowles;) he gets at the substance of a book directly; he tears out the heart of it.&rsquo; He kept it wrapt up in the tablecloth in his lap during the time of dinner, from an avidity to have one entertainment in readiness when he should have finished another; resembling (if I may use so coarse a simile) a dog who holds a bone in his paws in reserve, while he eats something else which has been thrown to him.</p>
<p class="p24">The subject of cookery having been very naturally introduced at a table where Johnson, who boasted of the niceness of his palate, owned that &lsquo;he always found a good dinner,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;I could write a better book of cookery than has ever yet been written; it should be a book upon philosophical principles. Pharmacy is now made much more simple. Cookery may be made so too. A prescription which is now compounded of five ingredients, had formerly fifty in it. So in cookery, if the nature of the ingredients be well known, much fewer will do. Then as you cannot make bad meat good, I would tell what is the best butcher&rsquo;s meat, the best beef, the best pieces; how to choose young fowls; the proper seasons of different vegetables; and then how to roast and boil, and compound.&rsquo; DILLY. &lsquo;Mrs. Glasse&rsquo;s Cookery, which is the best, was written by Dr. Hill. Half the TRADE know this.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Well, Sir. This shews how much better the subject of cookery may be treated by a philosopher. I doubt if the book be written by Dr. Hill; for, in Mrs. Glasse&rsquo;s Cookery, which I have looked into, salt-petre and sal-prunella are spoken of as different substances whereas sal-prunella is only salt-petre burnt on charcoal; and Hill could not be ignorant of this. However, as the greatest part of such a book is made by transcription, this mistake may have been carelessly adopted. But you shall see what a Book of Cookery I shall make! I shall agree with Mr. Dilly for the copy-right.&rsquo; Miss SEWARD. &lsquo;That would be Hercules with the distaff indeed.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;No, Madam. Women can spin very well; but they cannot make a good book of Cookery.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Mrs. Knowles affected to complain that men had much more liberty allowed them than women. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Madam, women have all the liberty they should wish to have. We have all the labour and the danger, and the women all the advantage. We go to sea, we build houses, we do everything, in short, to pay our court to the women.&rsquo; MRS. KNOWLES. &lsquo;The Doctor reasons very wittily, but not convincingly. Now, take the instance of building; the mason&rsquo;s wife, if she is ever seen in liquor, is ruined; the mason may get himself drunk as often as he pleases, with little loss of character; nay, may let his wife and children starve.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Madam, you must consider, if the mason does get himself drunk, and let his wife and children starve, the parish will oblige him to find security for their maintenance. We have different modes of restraining evil. Stocks for the men, a ducking-stool for women, and a pound for beasts. If we require more perfection from women than from ourselves, it is doing them honour. And women have not the same temptations that we have: they may always live in virtuous company; men must mix in the world indiscriminately. If a woman has no inclination to do what is wrong being secured from it is no restraint to her. I am at liberty to walk into the Thames; but if I were to try it, my friends would restrain me in Bedlam, and I should be obliged to them.&rsquo; MRS. KNOWLES. &lsquo;Still, Doctor, I cannot help thinking it a hardship that more indulgence is allowed to men than to women. It gives a superiority to men, to which I do not see how they are entitled.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;It is plain, Madam, one or other must have the superiority. As Shakspeare says, &ldquo;If two men ride on a horse, one must ride behind.&rdquo;&rsquo; DILLY. &lsquo;I suppose, Sir, Mrs. Knowles would have them to ride in panniers, one on each side.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Then, Sir, the horse would throw them both.&rsquo; MRS. KNOWLES. &lsquo;Well, I hope that in another world the sexes will be equal.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;That is being too ambitious, Madam. WE might as well desire to be equal with the angels. We shall all, I hope, be happy in a future state, but we must not expect to be all happy in the same degree. It is enough if we be happy according to our several capacities. A worthy carman will get to heaven as well as Sir Isaac Newton. Yet, though equally good, they will not have the same degrees of happiness.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Probably not.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Dr. Mayo having asked Johnson&rsquo;s opinion of Soame Jenyns&rsquo;s View of the Internal Evidence of the Christian Religion; &mdash; JOHNSON. &lsquo;I think it a pretty book; not very theological indeed; and there seems to be an affectation of ease and carelessness, as if it were not suitable to his character to be very serious about the matter.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;He may have intended this to introduce his book the better among genteel people, who might be unwilling to read too grave a treatise. There is a general levity in the age. We have physicians now with bag-wigs; may we not have airy divines, at least somewhat less solemn in their appearance than they used to be?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Jenyns might mean as you say.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;YOU should like his book, Mrs. Knowles, as it maintains, as you FRIENDS do, that courage is not a Christian virtue.&rsquo; MRS. KNOWLES. &lsquo;Yes, indeed, I like him there; but I cannot agree with him, that friendship is not a Christian virtue.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Madam, strictly speaking, he is right. All friendship is preferring the interest of a friend, to the neglect, or, perhaps, against the interest of others; so that an old Greek said, &ldquo;He that has FRIENDS has NO FRIEND.&rdquo; Now Christianity recommends universal benevolence, to consider all men as our brethren, which is contrary to the virtue of friendship, as described by the ancient philosophers. Surely, Madam, your sect must approve of this; for, you call all men FRIENDS.&rsquo; MRS. KNOWLES. &lsquo;We are commanded to do good to all men, &ldquo;but especially to them who are of the household of Faith.&rdquo;&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Well, Madam. The household of Faith is wide enough.&rsquo; MRS. KNOWLES. &lsquo;But, Doctor, our Saviour had twelve Apostles, yet there was ONE whom he LOVED. John was called &ldquo;the disciple whom JESUS loved.&rdquo;&rsquo; JOHNSON. (with eyes sparkling benignantly,) &lsquo;Very well, indeed, Madam. You have said very well.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;A fine application. Pray, Sir, had you ever thought of it?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;I had not, Sir.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">From this pleasing subject, he, I know not how or why, made a sudden transition to one upon which he was a violent aggressor; for he said, &lsquo;I am willing to love all mankind, EXCEPT AN AMERICAN:&rsquo; and his inflammable corruption bursting into horrid fire, he &lsquo;breathed out threatenings and slaughter;&rsquo; calling them, Rascals &mdash; Robbers &mdash; Pirates;&rsquo; and exclaiming, he&rsquo;d &lsquo;burn and destroy them.&rsquo; Miss Seward, looking to him with mild but steady astonishment, said, &lsquo;Sir, this is an instance that we are always most violent against those whom we have injured.&rsquo; He was irritated still more by this delicate and keen reproach; and roared out another tremendous volley, which one might fancy could be heard across the Atlantick. During this tempest I sat in great uneasiness, lamenting his heat of temper; till, by degrees, I diverted his attention to other topicks.</p>
<p class="p24">Talking of Miss &mdash;&mdash;&nbsp; &mdash; , a literary lady, he said, &lsquo;I was obliged to speak to Miss Reynolds, to let her know that I desired she would not flatter me so much.&rsquo; Somebody now observed, &lsquo;She flatters Garrick.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;She is in the right to flatter Garrick. She is in the right for two reasons; first, because she has the world with her, who have been praising Garrick these thirty years; and secondly, because she is rewarded for it by Garrick. Why should she flatter ME? I can do nothing for her. Let her carry her praise to a better market. (Then turning to Mrs. Knowles.) You, Madam, have been flattering me all the evening; I wish you would give Boswell a little now. If you knew his merit as well as I do, you would say a great deal; he is the best travelling companion in the world.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Somebody mentioned the Reverend Mr. Mason&rsquo;s prosecution of Mr. Murray, the bookseller, for having inserted in a collection of Gray&rsquo;s Poems, only fifty lines, of which Mr. Mason had still the exclusive property, under the statute of Queen Anne; and that Mr. Mason had persevered, notwithstanding his being requested to name his own terms of compensation. Johnson signified his displeasure at Mr. Mason&rsquo;s conduct very strongly; but added, by way of shewing that he was not surprized at it, &lsquo;Mason&rsquo;s a Whig.&rsquo; MRS. KNOWLES. (not hearing distinctly,) &lsquo;What! a Prig, Sir?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Worse, Madam; a Whig! But he is both.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Of John Wesley, he said, &lsquo;He can talk well on any subject.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Pray, Sir, what has he made of his story of a ghost?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, he believes it; but not on sufficient authority. He did not take time enough to examine the girl. It was at Newcastle, where the ghost was said to have appeared to a young woman several times, mentioning something about the right to an old house, advising application to be made to an attorney, which was done; and, at the same time, saying the attorneys would do nothing, which proved to be the fact. &ldquo;This (says John,) is a proof that a ghost knows our thoughts.&rdquo; Now (laughing,) it is not necessary to know our thoughts, to tell that an attorney will sometimes do nothing. Charles Wesley, who is a more stationary man, does not believe the story. I am sorry that John did not take more pains to inquire into the evidence for it.&rsquo; MISS SEWARD, (with an incredulous smile,) &lsquo;What, Sir! about a ghost?&rsquo; JOHNSON. (with solemn vehemence,) &lsquo;Yes, Madam: this is a question which, after five thousand years, is yet undecided; a question, whether in theology or philosophy, one of the most important that can come before the human understanding.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Mrs. Knowles mentioned, as a proselyte to Quakerism, Miss &mdash;&mdash;&nbsp; &mdash; , a young lady well known to Dr. Johnson, for whom he had shewn much affection; while she ever had, and still retained, a great respect for him. Mrs. Knowles at the same time took an opportunity of letting him know &lsquo;that the amiable young creature was sorry at finding that he was offended at her leaving the Church of England and embracing a simpler faith;&rsquo; and, in the gentlest and most persuasive manner, solicited his kind indulgence for what was sincerely a matter of conscience. JOHNSON. (frowning very angrily,) &lsquo;Madam, she is an odious wench. She could not have any proper conviction that it was her duty to change her religion, which is the most important of all subjects, and should be studied with all care, and with all the helps we can get. She knew no more of the Church which she left, and that which she embraced, than she did of the difference between the Copernican and Ptolemaick systems.&rsquo; MRS. KNOWLES. &lsquo;She had the New Testament before her.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Madam, she could not understand the New Testament, the most difficult book in the world, for which the study of a life is required.&rsquo; MRS. KNOWLES. &lsquo;It is clear as to essentials.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;But not as to controversial points. The heathens were easily converted, because they had nothing to give up; but we ought not, without very strong conviction indeed, to desert the religion in which we have been educated. That is the religion given you, the religion in which it may be said Providence has placed you. If you live conscientiously in that religion, you may be safe. But errour is dangerous indeed, if you err when you choose a religion for yourself.&rsquo; MRS. KNOWLES. &lsquo;Must we then go by implicit faith?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Madam, the greatest part of our knowledge is implicit faith; and as to religion, have we heard all that a disciple of Confucius, all that a Mahometan, can say for himself?&rsquo; He then rose again into passion, and attacked the young proselyte in the severest terms of reproach, so that both the ladies seemed to be much shocked.</p>
<p class="p24">We remained together till it was pretty late. Notwithstanding occasional explosions of violence, we were all delighted upon the whole with Johnson. I compared him at this time to a warm West-Indian climate, where you have a bright sun, quick vegetation, luxuriant foliage, luscious fruits; but where the same heat sometimes produces thunder, lightning, earthquakes, in a terrible degree.</p>
<p class="p24">April 17, being Good Friday, I waited on Johnson, as usual. I observed at breakfast that although it was a part of his abstemious discipline on this most solemn fast, to take no milk in his tea, yet when Mrs. Desmoulins inadvertently poured it in, he did not reject it. I talked of the strange indecision of mind, and imbecility in the common occurrences of life, which we may observe in some people. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, I am in the habit of getting others to do things for me.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;What, Sir! have you that weakness?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Yes, Sir. But I always think afterwards I should have done better for myself.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I expressed some inclination to publish an account of my Travels upon the continent of Europe, for which I had a variety of materials collected. JOHNSON. &lsquo;I do not say, Sir, you may not publish your travels; but I give you my opinion, that you would lessen yourself by it. What can you tell of countries so well known as those upon the continent of Europe, which you have visited?&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;But I can give an entertaining narrative, with many incidents, anecdotes, jeux d&rsquo;esprit, and remarks, so as to make very pleasant reading.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, most modern travellers in Europe who have published their travels, have been laughed at: I would not have you added to the number. The world is now not contented to be merely entertained by a traveller&rsquo;s narrative; they want to learn something. Now some of my friends asked me, why I did not give some account of my travels in France. The reason is plain; intelligent readers had seen more of France than I had. YOU might have liked my travels in France, and THE CLUB might have liked them; but, upon the whole, there would have been more ridicule than good produced by them.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;I cannot agree with you, Sir. People would like to read what you say of any thing. Suppose a face has been painted by fifty painters before; still we love to see it done by Sir Joshua.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;True, Sir, but Sir Joshua cannot paint a face when he has not time to look on it.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Sir, a sketch of any sort by him is valuable. And, Sir, to talk to you in your own style (raising my voice, and shaking my head,) you SHOULD have given us your travels in France. I am SURE I am right, and THERE&rsquo;S AN END ON&rsquo;T.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I said to him that it was certainly true, as my friend Dempster had observed in his letter to me upon the subject, that a great part of what was in his Journey to the Western Islands of Scotland had been in his mind before he left London. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why yes, Sir, the topicks were; and books of travels will be good in proportion to what a man has previously in his mind; his knowing what to observe; his power of contrasting one mode of life with another. As the Spanish proverb says, &ldquo;He, who would bring home the wealth of the Indies, must carry the wealth of the Indies with him.&rdquo; So it is in travelling; a man must carry knowledge with him, if he would bring home knowledge.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;The proverb, I suppose, Sir, means, he must carry a large stock with him to trade with.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Yes, Sir.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">It was a delightful day: as we walked to St. Clement&rsquo;s church, I again remarked that Fleet-street was the most cheerful scene in the world. &lsquo;Fleet-street (said I,) is in my mind more delightful than Tempe.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Ay, Sir; but let it be compared with Mull.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">There was a very numerous congregation to-day at St. Clement&rsquo;s church, which Dr. Johnson said he observed with pleasure.</p>
<p class="p24">And now I am to give a pretty full account of one of the most curious incidents in Johnson&rsquo;s life, of which he himself has made the following minute on this day: &lsquo;In my return from church, I was accosted by Edwards, an old fellow-collegian, who had not seen me since 1729. He knew me, and asked if I remembered one Edwards; I did not at first recollect the name, but gradually as we walked along, recovered it, and told him a conversation that had passed at an ale-house between us. My purpose is to continue our acquaintance.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">It was in Butcher-row that this meeting happened. Mr. Edwards, who was a decent-looking elderly man in grey clothes, and a wig of many curls, accosted Johnson with familiar confidence, knowing who he was, while Johnson returned his salutation with a courteous formality, as to a stranger. But as soon as Edwards had brought to his recollection their having been at Pembroke-College together nine-and-forty years ago, he seemed much pleased, asked where he lived, and said he should be glad to see him in Bolt-court. EDWARDS. &lsquo;Ah, Sir! we are old men now.&rsquo; JOHNSON. (who never liked to think of being old,) &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t let us discourage one another.&rsquo; EDWARDS. &lsquo;Why, Doctor, you look stout and hearty, I am happy to see you so; for the news-papers told us you were very ill.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Ay, Sir, they are always telling lies of US OLD FELLOWS.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Wishing to be present at more of so singular a conversation as that between two fellow-collegians, who had lived forty years in London without ever having chanced to meet, I whispered to Mr. Edwards that Dr. Johnson was going home, and that he had better accompany him now. So Edwards walked along with us, I eagerly assisting to keep up the conversation. Mr. Edwards informed Dr. Johnson that he had practised long as a solicitor in Chancery, but that he now lived in the country upon a little farm, about sixty acres, just by Stevenage in Hertfordshire, and that he came to London (to Barnard&rsquo;s Inn, No. 6), generally twice a week. Johnson appearing to me in a reverie, Mr. Edwards addressed himself to me, and expatiated on the pleasure of living in the country. BOSWELL. &lsquo;I have no notion of this, Sir. What you have to entertain you, is, I think, exhausted in half an hour.&rsquo; EDWARDS. &lsquo;What? don&rsquo;t you love to have hope realized? I see my grass, and my corn, and my trees growing. Now, for instance, I am curious to see if this frost has not nipped my fruit-trees.&rsquo; JOHNSON. (who we did not imagine was attending,) &lsquo;You find, Sir, you have fears as well as hopes.&rsquo; &mdash; So well did he see the whole, when another saw but the half of a subject.</p>
<p class="p24">When we got to Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s house, and were seated in his library, the dialogue went on admirably. EDWARDS. &lsquo;Sir, I remember you would not let us say PRODIGIOUS at College. For even then, Sir, (turning to me,) he was delicate in language, and we all feared him.&rsquo;* JOHNSON. (to Edwards,) &lsquo;From your having practised the law long, Sir, I presume you must be rich.&rsquo; EDWARDS. &lsquo;No, Sir; I got a good deal of money; but I had a number of poor relations to whom I gave a great part of it.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, you have been rich in the most valuable sense of the word.&rsquo; EDWARDS. &lsquo;But I shall not die rich.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Nay, sure, Sir, it is better to LIVE rich than to DIE rich.&rsquo; EDWARDS. &lsquo;I wish I had continued at College.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why do you wish that, Sir?&rsquo; EDWARDS. &lsquo;Because I think I should have had a much easier life than mine has been. I should have been a parson, and had a good living, like Bloxam and several others, and lived comfortably.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, the life of a parson, of a conscientious clergyman, is not easy. I have always considered a clergyman as the father of a larger family than he is able to maintain. I would rather have Chancery suits upon my hands than the cure of souls. No, Sir, I do not envy a clergyman&rsquo;s life as an easy life, nor do I envy the clergyman who makes it an easy life.&rsquo; Here taking himself up all of a sudden, he exclaimed, &lsquo;O! Mr. Edwards! I&rsquo;ll convince you that I recollect you. Do you remember our drinking together at an alehouse near Pembroke gate? At that time, you told me of the Eton boy, who, when verses on our SAVIOUR&rsquo;S turning water into wine were prescribed as an exercise, brought up a single line, which was highly admired, &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&ldquo;Vidit et erubuit lympha pudica DEUM,&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">and I told you of another fine line in Camden&rsquo;s Remains, an eulogy upon one of our Kings, who was succeeded by his son, a prince of equal merit: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&ldquo;Mira cano, Sol occubuit, nox nulla secuta est.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Johnson said to me afterwards, &lsquo;Sir, they respected me for</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my literature: and yet it was not great but by comparison.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is amazing how little literature there is in the</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;world.&rsquo; &mdash; BOSWELL</p>
<p class="p24">EDWARDS. &lsquo;You are a philosopher, Dr. Johnson. I have tried too in my time to be a philosopher; but, I don&rsquo;t know how, cheerfulness was always breaking in.&rsquo; &mdash; Mr. Burke, Sir Joshua Reynolds, Mr. Courtenay, Mr. Malone, and, indeed, all the eminent men to whom I have mentioned this, have thought it an exquisite trait of character. The truth is, that philosophy, like religion, is too generally supposed to be hard and severe, at least so grave as to exclude all gaiety.</p>
<p class="p24">EDWARDS. &lsquo;I have been twice married, Doctor. You, I suppose, have never known what it was to have a wife.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, I have known what it was to have a wife, and (in a solemn, tender, faultering tone) I have known what it was to LOSE A WIFE. &mdash; It had almost broke my heart.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">EDWARDS. &lsquo;How do you live, Sir? For my part, I must have my regular meals, and a glass of good wine. I find I require it.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;I now drink no wine, Sir. Early in life I drank wine: for many years I drank none. I then for some years drank a great deal.&rsquo; EDWARDS. &lsquo;Some hogs-heads, I warrant you.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;I then had a severe illness, and left it off, and I have never begun it again. I never felt any difference upon myself from eating one thing rather than another, nor from one kind of weather rather than another. There are people, I believe, who feel a difference; but I am not one of them. And as to regular meals, I have fasted from the Sunday&rsquo;s dinner to the Tuesday&rsquo;s dinner, without any inconvenience. I believe it is best to eat just as one is hungry: but a man who is in business, or a man who has a family, must have stated meals. I am a straggler. I may leave this town and go to Grand Cairo, without being missed here or observed there.&rsquo; EDWARDS. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you eat supper, Sir?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;No, Sir.&rsquo; EDWARDS. &lsquo;For my part, now, I consider supper as a turnpike through which one must pass, in order to get to bed.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">JOHNSON. &lsquo;You are a lawyer, Mr. Edwards. Lawyers know life practically. A bookish man should always have them to converse with. They have what he wants.&rsquo; EDWARDS. &lsquo;I am grown old: I am sixty-five.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;I shall be sixty-eight next birth-day. Come, Sir, drink water, and put in for a hundred.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">This interview confirmed my opinion of Johnson&rsquo;s most humane and benevolent heart. His cordial and placid behaviour to an old fellow-collegian, a man so different from himself; and his telling him that he would go down to his farm and visit him, showed a kindness of disposition very rare at an advanced age. He observed, &lsquo;how wonderful it was that they had both been in London forty years, without having ever once met, and both walkers in the street too!&rsquo; Mr. Edwards, when going away, again recurred to his consciousness of senility, and looking full in Johnson&rsquo;s face, said to him, &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll find in Dr. Young,</p>
<p class="p24">&ldquo;O my coevals! remnants of yourselves.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson did not relish this at all; but shook his head with impatience. Edwards walked off, seemingly highly pleased with the honour of having been thus noticed by Dr. Johnson. When he was gone, I said to Johnson, I thought him but a weak man. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, yes, Sir. Here is a man who has passed through life without experience: yet I would rather have him with me than a more sensible man who will not talk readily. This man is always willing to say what he has to say.&rsquo; Yet Dr. Johnson had himself by no means that willingness which he praised so much, and I think so justly; for who has not felt the painful effect of the dreary void, when there is a total silence in a company, for any length of time; or, which is as bad, or perhaps worse, when the conversation is with difficulty kept up by a perpetual effort?</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson once observed to me, &lsquo;Tom Tyers described me the best: &ldquo;Sir, (said he,) you are like a ghost: you never speak till you are spoken to.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">The gentleman whom he thus familiarly mentioned was Mr. Thomas Tyers, son of Mr. Jonathan Tyers, the founder of that excellent place of publick amusement, Vauxhall Gardens, which must ever be an estate to its proprietor, as it is peculiarly adapted to the taste of the English nation; there being a mixture of curious show, &mdash; gay exhibition, musick, vocal and instrumental, not too refined for the general ear; &mdash; for all which only a shilling is paid; and, though last, not least, good eating and drinking for those who choose to purchase that regale. Mr. Thomas Tyers was bred to the law; but having a handsome fortune, vivacity of temper, and eccentricity of mind, he could not confine himself to the regularity of practice. He therefore ran about the world with a pleasant carelessness, amusing everybody by his desultory conversation. He abounded in anecdote, but was not sufficiently attentive to accuracy. I therefore cannot venture to avail myself much of a biographical sketch of Johnson which he published, being one among the various persons ambitious of appending their names to that of my illustrious friend. That sketch is, however, an entertaining little collection of fragments. Those which he published of Pope and Addison are of higher merit; but his fame must chiefly rest upon his Political Conferences, in which he introduces several eminent persons delivering their sentiments in the way of dialogue, and discovers a considerable share of learning, various knowledge, and discernment of character. This much may I be allowed to say of a man who was exceedingly obliging to me, and who lived with Dr. Johnson in as easy a manner as almost any of his very numerous acquaintance.</p>
<p class="p24">Mr. Edwards had said to me aside, that Dr. Johnson should have been of a profession. I repeated the remark to Johnson that I might have his own thoughts on the subject. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, it WOULD have been better that I had been of a profession. I ought to have been a lawyer.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;I do not think, Sir, it would have been better, for we should not have had the English Dictionary.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;But you would have had Reports.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Ay; but there would not have been another, who could have written the Dictionary. There have been many very good Judges. Suppose you had been Lord Chancellor; you would have delivered opinions with more extent of mind, and in a more ornamented manner, than perhaps any Chancellor ever did, or ever will do. But, I believe, causes have been as judiciously decided as you could have done.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Yes, Sir. Property has been as well settled.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson, however, had a noble ambition floating in his mind, and had, undoubtedly, often speculated on the possibility of his supereminent powers being rewarded in this great and liberal country by the highest honours of the state. Sir William Scott informs me, that upon the death of the late Lord Lichfield, who was Chancellor of the University of Oxford, he said to Johnson, &lsquo;What a pity it is, Sir, that you did not follow the profession of the law. You might have been Lord Chancellor of Great Britain, and attained to the dignity of the peerage; and now that the title of Lichfleld, your native city, is extinct, you might have had it.&rsquo; Johnson, upon this, seemed much agitated; and, in an angry tone, exclaimed, &lsquo;Why will you vex me by suggesting this, when it is too late?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">But he did not repine at the prosperity of others. The late Dr. Thomas Leland, told Mr. Courtenay, that when Mr. Edmund Burke shewed Johnson his fine house and lands near Beaconsfield, Johnson coolly said, &lsquo;Non equidem invideo; miror magis.&rsquo;*</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* I am not entirely without suspicion that Johnson may have</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;felt a little momentary envy; for no man loved the good</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;things of this life better than he did and he could not but</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be conscious that he deserved a much larger share of them,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;than he ever had. &mdash; BOSWELL.</p>
<p class="p24">Yet no man had a higher notion of the dignity of literature than Johnson, or was more determined in maintaining the respect which he justly considered as due to it. Of this, besides the general tenor of his conduct in society, some characteristical instances may be mentioned.</p>
<p class="p24">He told Sir Joshua Reynolds, that once when he dined in a numerous company of booksellers, where the room being small, the head of the table, at which he sat, was almost close to the fire, he persevered in suffering a great deal of inconvenience from the heat, rather than quit his place, and let one of them sit above him.</p>
<p class="p24">Goldsmith, in his diverting simplicity, complained one day, in a mixed company, of Lord Camden. &lsquo;I met him (said he,) at Lord Clare&rsquo;s house in the country, and he took no more notice of me than if I had been an ordinary man. The company having laughed heartily, Johnson stood forth in defence of his friend. &lsquo;Nay, Gentlemen, (said he,) Dr. Goldsmith is in the right. A nobleman ought to have made up to such a man as Goldsmith; and I think it is much against Lord Camden that he neglected him.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Nor could he patiently endure to hear that such respect as he thought due only to higher intellectual qualities, should be bestowed on men of slighter, though perhaps more amusing talents. I told him, that one morning, when I went to breakfast with Garrick, who was very vain of his intimacy with Lord Camden, he accosted me thus:&mdash; &lsquo;Pray now, did you &mdash; did you meet a little lawyer turning the corner, eh?&rsquo;&mdash; &lsquo;No, Sir, (said I). Pray what do you mean by the question?&rsquo;&mdash; &lsquo;Why, (replied Garrick, with an affected indifference, yet as if standing on tip-toe,) Lord Camden has this moment left me. We have had a long walk together.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Well, Sir, Garrick talked very properly. Lord Camden WAS A LITTLE LAWYER to be associating so familiarly with a player.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Sir Joshua Reynolds observed, with great truth, that Johnson considered Garrick to be as it were his PROPERTY. He would allow no man either to blame or to praise Garrick in his presence, without contradicting him.</p>
<p class="p24">Having fallen into a very serious frame of mind, in which mutual expressions of kindness passed between us, such as would be thought too vain in me to repeat, I talked with regret of the sad inevitable certainty that one of us must survive the other. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Yes, Sir, that is an affecting consideration. I remember Swift, in one of his letters to Pope, says, &ldquo;I intend to come over, that we may meet once more; and when we must part, it is what happens to all human beings.&rdquo;&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;The hope that we shall see our departed friends again must support the mind.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why yes, Sir.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;There is a strange unwillingness to part with life, independent of serious fears as to futurity. A reverend friend of ours (naming him) tells me, that he feels an uneasiness at the thoughts of leaving his house, his study, his books.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;This is foolish in *****. A man need not be uneasy on these grounds; for, as he will retain his consciousness, he may say with the philosopher, Omnia mea mecum porto.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;True, Sir: we may carry our books in our heads; but still there is something painful in the thought of leaving for ever what has given us pleasure. I remember, many years ago, when my imagination was warm, and I happened to be in a melancholy mood, it distressed me to think of going into a state of being in which Shakspeare&rsquo;s poetry did not exist. A lady whom I then much admired, a very amiable woman, humoured my fancy, and relieved me by saying, &ldquo;The first thing you will meet in the other world, will be an elegant copy of Shakspeare&rsquo;s works presented to you.&rdquo;&rsquo; Dr. Johnson smiled benignantly at this, and did not appear to disapprove of the notion.</p>
<p class="p24">We went to St. Clement&rsquo;s church again in the afternoon, and then returned and drank tea and coffee in Mrs. Williams&rsquo;s room; Mrs. Desmoulins doing the honours of the tea-table. I observed that he would not even look at a proof-sheet of his Life of Waller on Good-Friday.</p>
<p class="p24">On Saturday, April 14, I drank tea with him. He praised the late Mr. Duncombe, of Canterbury, as a pleasing man. &lsquo;He used to come to me: I did not seek much after HIM. Indeed I never sought much after any body.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Lord Orrery, I suppose.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;No, Sir; I never went to him but when he sent for me.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Richardson?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Yes, Sir. But I sought after George Psalmanazar the most. I used to go and sit with him at an alehouse in the city.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I am happy to mention another instance which I discovered of his SEEKING AFTER a man of merit. Soon after the Honourable Daines Barrington had published his excellent Observations on the Statutes, Johnson waited on that worthy and learned gentleman; and, having told him his name, courteously said, &lsquo;I have read your book, Sir, with great pleasure, and wish to be better known to you.&rsquo; Thus began an acquaintance, which was continued with mutual regard as long as Johnson lived.</p>
<p class="p24">Talking of a recent seditious delinquent, he said, &lsquo;They should set him in the pillory, that he may be punished in a way that would disgrace him.&rsquo; I observed, that the pillory does not always disgrace. And I mentioned an instance of a gentleman who I thought was not dishonoured by it. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Ay, but he was, Sir. He could not mouth and strut as he used to do, after having been there. People are not willing to ask a man to their tables who has stood in the pillory.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson attacked the Americans with intemperate vehemence of abuse. I said something in their favour; and added, that I was always sorry when he talked on that subject. This, it seems, exasperated him; though he said nothing at the time. The cloud was charged with sulphureous vapour, which was afterwards to burst in thunder. &mdash; We talked of a gentleman who was running out his fortune in London; and I said, &lsquo;We must get him out of it. All his friends must quarrel with him, and that will soon drive him away.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Nay, Sir; we&rsquo;ll send YOU to him. If your company does not drive a man out of his house, nothing will.&rsquo; This was a horrible shock, for which there was no visible cause. I afterwards asked him why he had said so harsh a thing. JOHNSON. Because, Sir, you made me angry about the Americans.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;But why did you not take your revenge directly?&rsquo; JOHNSON. (smiling,) &lsquo;Because, Sir, I had nothing ready. A man cannot strike till he has his weapons.&rsquo; This was a candid and pleasant confession.</p>
<p class="p24">He shewed me to-night his drawing-room, very genteelly fitted up; and said, &lsquo;Mrs. Thrale sneered when I talked of my having asked you and your lady to live at my house. I was obliged to tell her, that you would be in as respectable a situation in my house as in hers. Sir, the insolence of wealth will creep out.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;She has a little both of the insolence of wealth, and the conceit of parts.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;The insolence of wealth is a wretched thing; but the conceit of parts has some foundation. To be sure it should not be. But who is without it?&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Yourself, Sir.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, I play no tricks: I lay no traps.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;No, Sir. You are six feet high, and you only do not stoop.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">We talked of the numbers of people that sometimes have composed the household of great families. I mentioned that there were a hundred in the family of the present Earl of Eglintoune&rsquo;s father. Dr. Johnson seeming to doubt it, I began to enumerate. &lsquo;Let us see: my Lord and my Lady two.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Nay, Sir, if you are to count by twos, you may be long enough.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Well, but now I add two sons and seven daughters, and a servant for each, that will make twenty; so we have the fifth part already.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Very true. You get at twenty pretty readily; but you will not so easily get further on. We grow to five feet pretty readily; but it is not so easy to grow to seven.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Monday, April 20, I found him at home in the morning. We talked of a gentleman who we apprehended was gradually involving his circumstances by bad management. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Wasting a fortune is evaporation by a thousand imperceptible means. If it were a stream, they&rsquo;d stop it. You must speak to him. It is really miserable. Were he a gamester, it could be said he had hopes of winning. Were he a bankrupt in trade, he might have grown rich; but he has neither spirit to spend nor resolution to spare. He does not spend fast enough to have pleasure from it. He has the crime of prodigality, and the wretchedness of parsimony. If a man is killed in a duel, he is killed as many a one has been killed; but it is a sad thing for a man to lie down and die; to bleed to death, because he has not fortitude enough to sear the wound, or even to stitch it up.&rsquo; I cannot but pause a moment to admire the fecundity of fancy, and choice of language, which in this instance, and, indeed, on almost all occasions, he displayed. It was well observed by Dr. Percy, now Bishop of Dromore, &lsquo;The conversation of Johnson is strong and clear, and may be compared to an antique statue, where every vein and muscle is distinct and bold. Ordinary conversation resembles an inferiour cast.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Saturday, April 25, I dined with him at Sir Joshua Reynolds&rsquo;s, with the learned Dr. Musgrave, Counsellor Leland of Ireland, son to the historian, Mrs. Cholmondeley, and some more ladies.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Demosthenes Taylor, as he was called, (that is, the Editor of Demosthenes) was the most silent man, the merest statue of a man that I have ever seen. I once dined in company with him, and all he said during the whole time was no more than Richard. How a man should say only Richard, it is not easy to imagine. But it was thus: Dr. Douglas was talking of Dr. Zachary Grey, and ascribing to him something that was written by Dr. Richard Grey. So, to correct him, Taylor said, (imitating his affected sententious emphasis and nod,) &ldquo;RICHARD.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Mrs. Cholmondeley, in a high flow of spirits, exhibited some lively sallies of hyperbolical compliment to Johnson, with whom she had been long acquainted, and was very easy. He was quick in catching the MANNER of the moment, and answered her somewhat in the style of the hero of a romance, &lsquo;Madam, you crown me with unfading laurels.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">We talked of a lady&rsquo;s verses on Ireland. MISS REYNOLDS. &lsquo;Have you seen them, Sir?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;No, Madam. I have seen a translation from Horace, by one of her daughters. She shewed it me.&rsquo; MISS REYNOLDS. &lsquo;And how was it, Sir?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, very well for a young Miss&rsquo;s verses; &mdash; that is to say, compared with excellence, nothing; but, very well, for the person who wrote them. I am vexed at being shewn verses in that manner.&rsquo; MISS REYNOLDS. &lsquo;But if they should be good, why not give them hearty praise?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Madam, because I have not then got the better of my bad humour from having been shown them. You must consider, Madam; beforehand they may be bad, as well as good. Nobody has a right to put another under such a difficulty, that he must either hurt the person by telling the truth, or hurt himself by telling what is not true.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;A man often shews his writings to people of eminence, to obtain from them, either from their good-nature, or from their not being able to tell the truth firmly, a commendation, of which he may afterwards avail himself.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Very true, Sir. Therefore the man, who is asked by an authour, what he thinks of his work, is put to the torture, and is not obliged to speak the truth; so that what he says is not considered as his opinion; yet he has said it, and cannot retract it; and this authour, when mankind are hunting him with a cannister at his tail, can say, &ldquo;I would not have published, had not Johnson, or Reynolds, or Musgrave, or some other good judge, commended the work.&rdquo; Yet I consider it as a very difficult question in conscience, whether one should advise a man not to publish a work, if profit be his object; for the man may say, &ldquo;Had it not been for you, I should have had the money.&rdquo; Now you cannot be sure; for you have only your own opinion, and the publick may think very differently.&rsquo; SIR JOSHUA REYNOLDS. &lsquo;You must upon such an occasion have two judgements; one as to the real value of the work, the other as to what may please the general taste at the time.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;But you can be SURE of neither; and therefore I should scruple much to give a suppressive vote. Both Goldsmith&rsquo;s comedies were once refused; his first by Garrick, his second by Colman, who was prevailed on at last by much solicitation, nay, a kind of force, to bring it on. His Vicar of Wakefield I myself did not think would have had much success. It was written and sold to a bookseller before his Traveller; but published after; so little expectation had the bookseller from it. Had it been sold after the Traveller he might have had twice as much money for it, though sixty guineas was no mean price. The bookseller had the advantage of Goldsmith&rsquo;s reputation from The Traveller in the sale, though Goldsmith had it not in selling the copy.&rsquo; SIR JOSHUA REYNOLDS. &lsquo;The Beggar&rsquo;s Opera affords a proof how strangely people will differ in opinion about a literary performance. Burke thinks it has no merit.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;It was refused by one of the houses; but I should have thought it would succeed, not from any great excellence in the writing, but from the novelty, and the general spirit and gaiety of the piece, which keeps the audience always attentive, and dismisses them in good humour.&rsquo;</p>
