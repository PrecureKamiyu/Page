Textbook discussions of distributed databases are oﬀered by [Ozsu and Valduriez (2010)]. A collection of papers on data management on cloud systems is in [Ooi and Parthasarathy (2009)].</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 119pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">The implementation of the transaction concept in a distributed database is pre- sented by [Gray (1981)] and [Traiger et al. (1982)]. The <span class="s44">2PC </span>protocol was developed by [Lampson and Sturgis (1976)]. The three-phase commit protocol is from [Skeen (1981)]. Techniques for non-blocking two-phase commit based on consensus, called Paxos Commit, are described in [Gray and Lamport (2004)].</p><p style="padding-left: 119pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">Chain replication was initially proposed by [van Renesse and Schneider (2004)] and an optimized version of was proposed by [Terrace and Freedman (2009)].</p><p style="padding-left: 119pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">Distributed optimistic concurrency control is described in [Agrawal et al. (1987)], while distributed snapshot isolation is described in [Binnig et al. (2014)] and [Schenkel et al. (1999)]. The externally consistent distributed multi-version 2PL scheme used in Spanner is described in [Corbett et al. (2013)].</p><p style="padding-left: 119pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">The <span class="s44">CAP </span>theorem was conjectured by [Brewer (2000)], and was formalized and proved by [Gilbert and Lynch (2002)]. [Cooper et al. (2008)] describe Yahoo!’s <span class="s44">PNUTS </span>system, including its support for asynchronous maintenance of replicas us- ing a publish-subscribe system. Parallel view maintenance is described in [Chen et al. (2004)] and [Zhang et al. (2004)], while asynchronous view maintenance is described in [Agrawal et al. (2009)]. Transaction processing in federated database systems is discussed in [Mehrotra et al. (2001)].</p><p style="padding-left: 119pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">Paxos is described in [Lamport (1998)]; Paxos is based on features from several earlier protocols, reference in [Lamport (1998)]. Google’s Chubby lock service, which is based on Paxos, is described by [Burrows (2006)]. The widely used ZooKeeper sys- tem for distributed coordination is described in [Hunt et al. (2010)], and the consensus protocol (also known as atomic broadcast protocol) used in ZooKeeper is described in [Junqueira et al. (2011)]. The Raft consensus protocol is described in [Ongaro and Ousterhout (2014)].</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part429.htm">&lt; 上一个</a><span> | </span><a href="../database.html">内容</a><span> | </span><a href="part431.htm">下一个 &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
