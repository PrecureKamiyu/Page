<p class="p21"><a id="a1027"></a>IN February, 1767, there happened one of the most remarkable incidents of Johnson&rsquo;s life, which gratified his monarchical enthusiasm, and which he loved to relate with all its circumstances, when requested by his friends. This was his being honoured by a private conversation with his Majesty, in the library at the Queen&rsquo;s house. He had frequently visited those splendid rooms and noble collection of books*, which he used to say was more numerous and curious than he supposed any person could have made in the time which the King had employed. Mr. Barnard, the librarian, took care that he should have every accommodation that could contribute to his ease and convenience, while indulging his literary taste in that place; so that he had here a very agreeable resource at leisure hours.</p>
<p class="p24"><a id="a1028"></a>His Majesty having been informed of his occasional visits, was pleased to signify a desire that he should be told when Dr. Johnson came next to the library. Accordingly, the next time that Johnson did come, as soon as he was fairly engaged with a book, on which, while he sat by the fire, he seemed quite intent, Mr. Barnard stole round to the apartment where the King was, and, in obedience to his Majesty&rsquo;s commands, mentioned that Dr. Johnson was then in the library. His Majesty said he was at leisure, and would go to him; upon which Mr. Barnard took one of the candles that stood on the King&rsquo;s table, and lighted his Majesty through a suite of rooms, till they came to a private door into the library, of which his Majesty had the key. Being entered, Mr. Barnard stepped forward hastily to Dr. Johnson, who was still in a profound study, and whispered him, &ldquo;Sir, here is the King.&rdquo; Johnson started up, and stood still. His Majesty approached him, and at once was courteously easy.</p>
<p class="p24">His Majesty began by observing, that he understood he came sometimes to the library; and then mentioning his having heard that the Doctor had been lately at Oxford, asked him if he was not fond of going thither. To which Johnson answered, that he was indeed fond of going to Oxford sometimes, but was likewise glad to come back again. The King then asked him what they were doing at Oxford. Johnson answered, he could not much commend their diligence, but that in some respects they were mended, for they had put their press under better regulations, and were at that time printing Polybius. He was then asked whether there were better libraries at Oxford or Cambridge. He answered, he believed the Bodleian was larger than any they had at Cam|bridge; at the same time adding, &ldquo;I hope, whether we have more books or not than they have at Cambridge, we shall make as good use of them as they do.&rdquo; Being asked whether All-Souls or Christ-Church library was the largest, he answered, &ldquo;All-Souls library is the largest we have, except the Bodleian.&rdquo; &ldquo;Aye, (said the King,) that is the publick library.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">His Majesty enquired if he was then writing any thing. He answered, he was not, for he had pretty well told the world what he knew, and must now read to acquire more knowledge. The King, as it should seem with a view to urge him to rely on his own stores as an original writer, and to continue his labours, then said, &ldquo;I do not think you borrow much from any body.&rdquo; Johnson said, he thought he had already done his part as a writer. &ldquo;I should have thought so too, (said the King,) if you had not written so well.&rdquo; &mdash; Johnson observed to me, upon this, that &ldquo;No man could have paid a hand|somer compliment; and it was fit for a King to pay. It was decisive.&rdquo; When asked by another friend, at Sir Joshua Reynolds&rsquo;s, whether he made any reply to this high compliment, he answered, &ldquo;No, Sir. When the King had said it, it was to be so. It was not for me to bandy civilities with my sovereign.&rdquo; Perhaps no man who had spent his whole life in courts could have shewn a more nice and dignified sense of true politeness, than Johnson did in this instance.</p>
<p class="p24">His Majesty having observed to him that he supposed he must have read a great deal; Johnson answered, that he thought more than he read; that he had read a great deal in the early part of his life, but having fallen into ill health, he had not been able to read much, compared with others: for instance, he said he had not read much compared with Dr. Warburton. Upon which the King said, that he heard Dr. Warburton was a man of such general knowledge, that you could scarce talk with him on any subject on which he was not qualified to speak; and that his learning resembled Garrick&rsquo;s acting, in its universality. His Majesty then talked of the controversy between Warburton and Lowth, which he seemed to have read, and asked Johnson what he thought of it. Johnson answered, &ldquo;Warburton has most general, most scholastick learning; Lowth is the more correct scholar. I do not know which of them calls names best.&rdquo; The King was pleased to say he was of the same opinion; adding, &ldquo;You do not think then, Dr. Johnson, that there was much argument in the case.&rdquo; Johnson said, he did not think there was. &ldquo;Why truly, (said the King,) when once it comes to calling names, argu|ment is pretty well at an end.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">His Majesty then asked him what he thought of Lord Lyttelton&rsquo;s history, which was then just published. Johnson said, he thought his style pretty good, but that he had blamed Henry the Second rather too much. &ldquo;Why, (said the King,) they seldom do these things by halves.&rdquo; &ldquo;No, Sir, (answered Johnson,) not to Kings.&rdquo; But fearing to be misunderstood, he proceeded to explain himself; and immediately subjoined, &ldquo;That for those who spoke worse of Kings than they deserved, he could find no excuse, but that he could more easily conceive how some might speak better of them than they deserved, without any ill intention; for, as Kings had much in their power to give, those who were favoured by them would frequently, from gratitude, exagge|rate their praises; and as this proceeded from a good motive, it was certainly excuseable, as far as errour could be excuseable.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">The King then asked him what he thought of Dr. Hill. Johnson answered, that he was an ingenious man, but had no veracity; and immediately mentioned, as an instance of it, an assertion of that writer, that he had seen objects magnified to a much greater degree by using three or four micro|scopes at a time, than by using one. &ldquo;Now, (added Johnson,) every one acquainted with microscopes knows, that the more of them he looks through, the less the object will appear.&rdquo; &ldquo;Why, (replied the King,) this is not only telling an untruth, but telling it clumsily; for, if that be the case, every one who can look through a microscope will be able to detect him.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&ldquo;I now, (said Johnson to his friends, when relating what had passed,) began to consider that I was depreciating this man in the estimation of his sovereign, and thought it was time for me to say something that might be more favourable.&rdquo; He added, therefore, that Dr. Hill was, notwithstanding, a very curious observer; and if he would have been contented to tell the world no more than he knew, he might have been a very considerable man, and needed not to have recourse to such mean expedients to raise his reputation.</p>
<p class="p24">The King then talked of literary journals, mentioned particularly the Journal des Savans, and asked Johnson if it was well done. Johnson said, it was formerly very well done, and gave some account of the persons who began it, and carried it on for some years; enlarging at the same time, on the nature and use of such works. The King asked him if it was well done now. Johnson answered, he had no reason to think that it was. The King then asked him if there were any other literary journals published in this kingdom, except the Monthly and Critical Reviews; and on being answered there were no other, his Majesty asked which of them was the best: Johnson answered, that the Monthly Review was done with most care, the Critical upon the best principles; adding, that the authours of the Monthly Review were enemies to the Church. This the King said he was sorry to hear.</p>
<p class="p24">The conversation next turned on the Philosophical Transactions, when Johnson observed, that they had now a better method of arranging their materials than formerly. &ldquo;Aye, (said the King,) they are obliged to Dr. Johnson for that;&rdquo; for his Majesty had heard and remembered the circum|stance, which Johnson himself had forgot.</p>
<p class="p24">His Majesty expressed a desire to have the literary biography of this country ably executed, and proposed to Dr. Johnson to undertake it. Johnson signified his readiness to comply with his Majesty&rsquo;s wishes.</p>
<p class="p24">During the whole of this interview, Johnson talked to his Majesty with profound respect, but still in his firm manly manner, with a sonorous voice, and never in that subdued tone which is commonly used at the levee and in the drawing-room. After the King withdrew, Johnson shewed himself highly pleased with his Majesty&rsquo;s conversation and gracious behaviour. He said to Mr. Barnard, &ldquo;Sir, they may talk of the King as they will; but he is the finest gentleman I have ever seen.&rdquo; And he afterwards observed to Mr. Langton, &ldquo;Sir, his manners are those of as fine a gentleman as we may suppose Lewis the Fourteenth or Charles the Second.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">At Sir Joshua Reynolds&rsquo;s, where a circle of Johnson&rsquo;s friends was collected round him to hear his account of this memorable conversation, Dr. Joseph Warton, in his frank and lively manner, was very active in pressing him to mention the particulars. &ldquo;Come now, Sir, this is an interesting matter; do favour us with it.&rdquo; Johnson, with great good humour, complied.</p>
<p class="p24">He told them, &ldquo;I found his Majesty wished I should talk, and I made it my business to talk. I find it does a man good to be talked to by his sovereign. In the first place, a man cannot be in a passion&mdash; &ldquo; Here some question interrupted him, which is to be regretted, as he certainly would have pointed out and illustrated many circumstances of advantage, from being in a situation, where the powers of the mind are at once excited to vigorous exertion, and tempered by reverential awe.</p>
<p class="p24">During all the time in which Dr. Johnson was employed in relating to the circle at Sir Joshua Reynolds&rsquo;s the particulars of what passed between the King and him, Dr. Goldsmith remained unmoved upon a sopha at some distance, affecting not to join in the least in the eager curiosity of the com|pany. He assigned as a reason for his gloom and seeming inattention, that he apprehended Johnson had relinquished his purpose of furnishing him with a Prologue to his play, with the hopes of which he had been flattered; but it was strongly suspected that he was fretting with chagrin and envy at the singular honour Dr. Johnson had lately enjoyed. At length, the frankness and simplicity of his natural character prevailed. He sprung from the sopha, advanced to Johnson, and in a kind of flutter, from imagining himself in the situation which he had just been hearing described, exclaimed, &ldquo;Well, you acquitted yourself in this conversation better than I should have done; for I should have bowed and stammered through the whole of it.&rdquo;</p>
