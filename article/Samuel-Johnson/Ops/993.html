<p class="p24">(<span class="t8">Page</span> 314.)</p>
<p class="p24">The alehouse in the city where Johnson used to go and sit with George Psalmanazar was, no doubt, the club in Old Street, where he met also &lsquo;the metaphysical tailor,&rsquo; the uncle of Hoole the poet (<span class="t8">post</span>, under March 30, 1783). Psalmanazar is mentioned a third time by Boswell (<span class="t8">post</span>, May 15, 1784) in a passage borrowed from Hawkins&rsquo;s edition of Johnson&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Works</span>, xi. 206, where it is stated that &lsquo;Johnson said: &ldquo;He had never seen the close of the life of any one that he wished so much his own to resemble as that of him, for its purity and devotion.&rdquo; He was asked whether he ever contradicted him. &ldquo;I should as soon,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;have thought of contradicting a bishop.&rdquo; When he was asked whether he had ever mentioned Formosa before him, he said, &ldquo;he was afraid to mention even China.&rdquo;&rsquo; We learn from Hawkins&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Life of Johnson</span>, p. 547, that &lsquo;Psalmanazar lived in Ironmonger Row, Old Street; in the neighbourhood whereof he was so well known and esteemed, that, as Dr. Hawkesworth once told me, scarce any person, even children, passed him without shewing him the usual signs of respect.&rsquo; In the list of the writers of the <span class="t8">Universal History</span> that Johnson drew up a few days before his death his name is given as the historian of the Jews, Gauls, and Spaniards (<span class="t8">post</span>, November, 1784). According to Mrs. Piozzi (<span class="t8">Anecdotes</span>, p. 175):&mdash; &lsquo;His pious and patient endurance of a tedious illness, ending in an exemplary death, confirmed the strong impression his merit had made upon the mind of Mr. Johnson. &ldquo;It is so very difficult,&rdquo; said he always, &ldquo;for a sick man not to be a scoundrel.&rdquo;&rsquo; Johnson, in <span class="t8">Prayers and Meditations</span>, p. 102, mentions him as a man &lsquo;whose life was, I think, uniform.&rsquo; Smollett, in <span class="t8">Humphry Clinker</span> (in Melford&rsquo;s Letter of June 10), describes him as one &lsquo;who, after having drudged half a century in the literary mill, in all the simplicity and abstinence of an Asiatic, subsists upon the charity of a few booksellers, just sufficient to keep him from the parish.&rsquo; A writer in the <span class="t8">Annual Register</span> for 1764 (ii. 71), speaking of the latter part of his life, says:&mdash; &lsquo;He was concerned in compiling and writing works of credit, and lived exemplarily for many years.&rsquo; He died a few days before that memorable sixteenth day of May 1763, when Boswell first met Johnson. It is a pity that no record has been kept of the club meetings in Ironmonger Row, for then we should have seen Johnson in a new light. Johnson in an alehouse club, with a metaphysical tailor on one side of him, and an aged writer on the other side of him, &lsquo;who spoke English with the city accent and coarsely enough,&rsquo; and whom he would never venture to contradict, is a Johnson that we cannot easily imagine.</p>
<p class="p24">Of the greater part of Psalmanazar&rsquo;s life we know next to nothing &mdash; little, I believe, beyond the few facts that I have here gathered together. His early years he has described in his <span class="t8">Memoirs</span>. That he started as one of the most shameless impostors, and that he remained a hypocrite and a cheat till he was fully forty, if not indeed longer, his own narrative shows. That for many years he lived laboriously, frugally, and honestly seems to be no less certain. How far his <span class="t8">Memoirs</span> are truthful is somewhat doubtful. In them he certainly confesses the impudent trick which he had played in his youth, when he passed himself off as a Formosan convert. He wished, he writes, &lsquo;to undeceive the world by unravelling that whole mystery of iniquity&rsquo; (p. 5). He lays bare roguery enough, and in a spirit, it seems, of real sorrow. Nevertheless there are passages which are not free from the leaven of hypocrisy, and there are, I suspect, statements which are at least partly false. Johnson, indeed, looked upon him as little less than a saint; but then, as Sir Joshua Reynolds tells us, though &lsquo;Johnson was not easily imposed upon by professions to honesty and candour, he appeared to have little suspicion of hypocrisy in religion.&rsquo; It was in the year 1704 that Psalmanazar published his <span class="t8">Historical and Geographical Description of Formosa</span>. So gross is the forgery that it almost passes belief that it was widely accepted as a true narrative. He gave himself out as a native of that island and a convert to Christianity. He lied so foolishly as to maintain that in the Academies of Formosa Greek was studied (p. 290). He asserted also that in an island that is only about half as large as Ireland 18,000 boys were sacrificed every year (p. 176). But his readers were for the most part only too willing to be deceived; for in Protestant England his abuse of the Jesuits covered a multitude of lies. Ere he had been three months in London, he was, he writes (<span class="t8">Memoirs</span>, p. 179), &lsquo;cried up for a prodigy, and not only the domestic, but even the foreign papers had helped to blaze forth many things in his praise.&rsquo; He was aided in his fraud by the Rev. Dr. Innes, or Innys, a clergyman of the English Church, who by means of his interesting convert pushed himself into the notice of Compton, Bishop of London, and before long was made chaplain-general to the English forces in Portugal (<span class="t8">Memoirs</span>, p. 191). The same man, as Boswell tells us (<span class="t8">ante</span>, i. 359), by another impudent cheat, a second time obtained &lsquo;considerable promotion.&rsquo; Psalmanazar&rsquo;s book soon reached a second edition, &lsquo;besides the several versions it had abroad&rsquo; (p. 5). Yet it is very dull reading &mdash; just such a piece of work as might be looked for from a young man of little fancy, but gifted with a strong memory. Nevertheless, the author&rsquo;s credit lasted so long, that for many years he lived on a subscription &lsquo;which was founded on a belief of his being a Formosan and a real convert to the Church of England&rsquo; (p. 208). He was even sent to Oxford to study, and had rooms in one of the colleges &mdash; Christ Church, if I mistake not (p. 186). It was not only as a student that he was sent by his dupes to that ancient seat of learning; the Bishop of London hoped that he would &lsquo;teach the Formosan language to a set of gentlemen who were afterwards to go with him to convert those people to Christianity&rsquo; (p. 161).</p>
<p class="p24">While he was living the life of a lying scoundrel, he was, he says (p. 192), &lsquo;happily restrained by Divine Grace,&rsquo; so that &lsquo;all sense of remorse was not extinguished,&rsquo; and there was no fall into &lsquo;downright infidelity.&rsquo; At length he picked up Law&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Serious Call</span>, which moved him, as later on it moved better men (<span class="t8">ante</span>, i. 68). Step by step he got into a way of steady work, and lived henceforth a laborious and honest life. It was in the year 1728, thirty-five years before his death, that he began, he says, to write the narrative of his imposture (p. 59). A dangerous illness and the dread of death had deeply moved him, and filled him with the desire of leaving behind &lsquo;a faithful narrative&rsquo; which would &lsquo;undeceive the world.&rsquo; Nineteen years later, though he did not publish his narrative, he made a public confession of his guilt. In the unsigned article on Formosa, which he wrote in 1747 for Bowen&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Complete System of Geography</span> (ii. 251), he says, &lsquo;Psalmanaazaar [so he had at one time written his name] hath long since ingenuously owned the contrary [of the truthfulness of his narrative] though not in so public a manner, as he might perhaps have done, had not such an avowment been likely to have affected some few persons who for private ends took advantage of his youthful vanity to encourage him in an imposture, which he might otherwise never had the thought, much less the confidence, to have carried on. These persons being now dead, and out of all danger of being hurt by it, he now gives us leave to assure the world that the greatest part of that account was fabulous â€¦ and that he designs to leave behind him a faithful account of that unhappy step, and other particulars of his life leading to it, to be published after his death.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">In his <span class="t8">Memoirs</span> he will not, he writes (p. 59), give any account &lsquo;of his real country or family.&rsquo; Yet it is quite clear from his own narrative that he was born in the south of France. &lsquo;His pronunciation of French had,&rsquo; it was said, &lsquo;a spice of the Gascoin accent, and in that provincial dialect he was so masterly that none but those born in the country could excel him&rsquo; (Preface, p. 1). If a town can be found that answers to all that he tells of his birth-place, his whole account may be true; but the circumstances that he mentions seem inconsistent. The city in which he was born was twenty-four miles from an archiepiscopal city in which there was a college of Jesuits (p. 67), and about sixty miles from &lsquo;a noble great city full of gentry and nobility, of coaches, and all kinds of grandeur,&rsquo; the seat of a great university (pp. 76, 83). When he left the great city for Avignon he speaks of himself as &lsquo;going <span class="t8">down</span> to Avignon&rsquo; (p. 87). Thence he started on a pilgrimage to Rome, and in order to avoid his native place, after he had gone no great way, &lsquo;he wheeled about to the left, to leave the place at some twenty or thirty miles distance&rsquo; (p. 101). He changed his mind, however, and returned home. Thence he set off to join his father, who was &lsquo;near 500 miles off&rsquo; in Germany (p. 60). &lsquo;The direct route was through the great university city&rsquo; and Lyons (p. 104). His birth-place then, if his account is true, was on the road from Avignon to Rome, sixty miles from a great university city and southwards of it, for through this university city passed the direct road from his home to Lyons. It was, moreover, sixty miles from an archiepiscopal city. I do not think that such a place can be found. He says (p. 59) that he thought himself &lsquo;obliged out of respect to his country and family to conceal both, it being but too common, though unjust, to censure them for the crimes of private persons.&rsquo; The excuse seems unsatisfactory, for he tells enough to shew that he came from the South of France, while for his family there was no need of care. It was, he writes, &lsquo;ancient but decayed,&rsquo; and he was the only surviving child. Of his father and mother he had heard nothing since he started on the career of a pious rogue. They must have been dead very many years by the time his <span class="t8">Memoirs</span> were given to the world. His story shews that at all events for the first part of his life he had been one of the vainest of men, and vanity is commonly found joined with a love of mystery. He is not consistent, moreover, in his dates. On April 23, 1752, he was in the 73rd year of his age (p. 7); so that he was born in either 1679 or 1680. When he joined his father he was &lsquo;hardly full sixteen years old&rsquo; (p. 112); yet it was a few years after the Peace of Ryswick, which was signed on September 22, 1697. He was, he says, &lsquo;but near twenty&rsquo; when he wrote his <span class="t8">History of Formosa</span> (p. 184). This was in the year 1704.</p>
<p class="p24">With his father he stayed but a short time, and then set out rambling northwards. At Avignon, by shameless lying, he had obtained a pass &lsquo;as a young student in theology, of Irish extract [<span class="t8">sic</span>] who had left his country for the sake of religion&rsquo; (p. 98). It was wonderful that his fraud had escaped detection there, for he had kept his own name, &lsquo;because it had something of quality in it&rsquo; (p. 99). He now resolved on a more impudent pretence; for &lsquo;passing as an Irishman and a sufferer for religion, did not only,&rsquo; he writes, &lsquo;expose me to the danger of being discovered, but came short of the merit and admiration I had expected from it&rsquo; (p. 112). He thereupon gave himself out as a Japanese convert, and forged a fresh pass, &lsquo;clapping to it the old seal&rsquo; (p. 116). He went through different adventures, and at last enlisted in the army of the Elector of Cologne &mdash; an &lsquo;unhappy herd, destitute of all sense of religion and shamefacedness.&rsquo; He got his discharge, but enlisted a second time, &lsquo;passing himself off for a Japanese and a heathen, under the name of Salmanazar&rsquo; (pp. 133-141). Later on he altered it, he says, &lsquo;by the addition of a letter or two to make it somewhat different from that mentioned in the <span class="t8">Book of Kings</span>&rsquo; (Shalmaneser, II <span class="t8">Kings</span>, xvii. 3). In his <span class="t8">Description of Formosa</span> he wrote it Psalmanaazaar, and in later life Psalmanazar. In his vanity he invented &lsquo;an awkward show of worship, turning his face to the rising or setting sun, and pleased to be taken notice of for so doing&rsquo; (p. 144). He had moreover &lsquo;the ambition of passing for a moral heathen&rsquo; (p. 147). By way of singularity he next took to living altogether upon raw flesh, roots, and herbs (p. 163).</p>
<p class="p24">It was when he was on garrison duty at Sluys that he became acquainted with Innes, who was chaplain to a Scotch regiment that was in the pay of the Dutch (p. 148). This man found in him a tool ready made to his hand. He had at once seen through his roguery, but he used his knowledge only to plunge him deeper in his guilt. By working on his fears and his vanity and by small bribes he induced him to profess himself a convert to the Church of England and to submit to baptism (p. 158). He brought him over to London, and introduced him to the Bishop of London, and to Tenison, Archbishop of Canterbury (pp. 164, 179). Psalmanazar spoke Latin fluently, but &lsquo;his Grace had either forgotten his, or being unused to the foreign pronunciation was forced to have it interpreted to him by Dr. Innes in English&rsquo; (p. 178). The young impostor everywhere gave himself out as a Formosan who had been entrapped by a Jesuit priest, and brought to Avignon. &lsquo;There I could expect,&rsquo; he wrote, &lsquo;no mercy from the Inquisitors, if I had not in hypocrisy professed their religion&rsquo; (<span class="t8">History of Formosa</span>, p. 25). He was kept, he says, in a kind of custody, &lsquo;but I trusted under God to my heels&rsquo; (p. 24). It was Innes who made him write this <span class="t8">History</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">In the confession of his fraud Psalmanazar seems to keep back nothing. His repentance appears to be sincere, and his later life, there can be little question, was regular. Yet, as I have said, even his confessions apparently are not free from the old leaven of hypocrisy. It is indeed very hard, if not altogether impossible, for a man who has passed forty years and more as a lying hypocrite altogether to &lsquo;clear his mind of cant.&rsquo; In writing of the time when he was still living the life of a lying scoundrel, he says:&mdash; &lsquo;I have great reason to acknowledge it the greatest mercy that could befall me, that I was so well grounded in the principles and evidence of the Christian religion, that neither the conversation of the then freethinkers, as they loved to stile themselves, and by many of whom I was severely attacked, nor the writings of Hobbes, Spinosa, &amp;c. against the truth of Divine revelation could appear to me in any other light than as the vain efforts of a dangerous set of men to overturn a religion, the best founded and most judiciously calculated to promote the peace and happiness of mankind, both temporal and eternal&rsquo; (<span class="t8">Memoirs</span>, p. 192). Two pages further on he writes, a little boastfully it seems, of having had &lsquo;some sort of gallantry with the fair sex; with many of whom, even persons of fortune and character, of sense, wit, and learning, I was become,&rsquo; he continues, &lsquo;a great favourite, and might, if I could have overcome my natural sheepishness and fear of a repulse, have been more successful either by way of matrimony or intrigue.&rsquo; He goes on:&mdash; &lsquo;I may truly say, that hardly any man who might have enjoyed so great a variety ever indulged himself in so few instances of the unlawful kind as I have done.&rsquo; He concludes this passage in his writings by &lsquo;thankfully acknowledging that there must have been some secret providence that kept me from giving such way to unlawful amours as I might otherwise have done, to the ruin of my health, circumstances,&rsquo; &amp;c.</p>
<p class="p24">When he came to wish for an honest way of life he was beset with difficulties. &lsquo;What a deadly wound,&rsquo; he writes, &lsquo;must such an unexpected confession have given to my natural vanity, and what a mortification would it have been to such sincere honest people [as my friends] to hear it from my mouth!&rsquo; (p. 213.) This was natural enough. That he long hesitated, like a coward, on the brink is not to be cast in his teeth, seeing that at last he took the plunge. But then in speaking of the time when he weakly repeated, and to use his own words, &lsquo;as it were confirmed anew,&rsquo; his old falsehoods, he should not have written that &lsquo;as the assurance of God&rsquo;s mercy gave me good grounds to hope, so that hope inspired me with a design to use all proper means to obtain it, and leave the issue of it to his Divine Providence&rsquo; (p. 214). The only proper means to obtain God&rsquo;s mercy was at once to own to all the world that he had lied. It is only the Tartuffes and the Holy Willies who, whilst they persist in their guilt, talk of leaving the issue to the Divine Providence of God.</p>
<p class="p24">Since this Appendix was in type I have learnt, through the kindness of Mr. C.E. Doble, the editor of Hearne&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Remarks and Collections</span>, ed. 1885, that a passage in that book (i. 271), confirms my conjecture that Psalmanazar was lodged in Christ Church when at Oxford. Hearne says (July 9, 1706):&mdash; &lsquo;Mr. Topping of Christ Church â€¦ also tells me that Salmanezzer, the famous Formosan, when he left Christ Church (where he resided while in Oxon) left behind him a Book in MSt., wherein a distinct acct was given of the Consular and Imperial coyns by himself.&rsquo; Mr. Doble has also pointed out to me in the first edition of the <span class="t8">Spectator</span> the following passage at the end of No. 14: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">&lsquo;ADVERTISEMENT.</span></p>
<p class="p21">&lsquo;On the first of April will be performed at the Play-house in the Hay-market an opera call&rsquo;d <span class="t8">The Cruelty of Atreus</span>. N.B. The Scene wherein Thyestes eats his own children is to be performed by the famous Mr. Psalmanazar lately arrived from Formosa: The whole Supper being set to Kettle-drums.&rsquo;</p>

<p class="p10"><span class="t4">APPENDIX B.</span></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">JOHNSON&rsquo;S TRAVELS AND LOVE OF TRAVELLING.</span></p>
<p class="p24">(<span class="t8">Page 352</span>).</p>
<p class="p24">On the passage in the text Macaulay in his Review of Croker&rsquo;s Edition of <span class="t8">Boswell&rsquo;s Life of Johnson</span> partly founds the following criticism: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Johnson&rsquo;s visit to the Hebrides introduced him to a state of society completely new to him; and a salutary suspicion of his own deficiencies seems on that occasion to have crossed his mind for the first time. He confessed, in the last paragraph of his <span class="t8">Journey</span>, that his thoughts on national manners were the thoughts of one who had seen but little, of one who had passed his time almost wholly in cities. This feeling, however, soon passed away. It is remarkable that to the last he entertained a fixed contempt for all those modes of life and those studies which tend to emancipate the mind from the prejudices of a particular age or a particular nation. Of foreign travel and of history he spoke with the fierce and boisterous contempt of ignorance. &ldquo;What does a man learn by travelling? Is Beauclerk the better for travelling? What did Lord Charlemont learn in his travels, except that there was a snake in one of the pyramids of Egypt?&rdquo;&rsquo; Macaulay&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Essays</span>, ed. 1843, i. 403.</p>
<p class="p24">In another passage (p. 400) Macaulay says: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Johnson was no master of the great science of human nature. He had studied, not the genus man, but the species Londoner. Nobody was ever so thoroughly conversant with all the forms of life and all the shades of moral and intellectual character which were to be seen from Islington to the Thames, and from Hyde-Park corner to Mile-end green. But his philosophy stopped at the first turnpike-gate. Of the rural life of England he knew nothing, and he took it for granted that everybody who lived in the country was either stupid or miserable.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Of the two assertions that Macaulay makes in these two passages, while one is for the most part true, the other is utterly and grossly false. Johnson had no contempt for foreign travel. That curiosity which animated his eager mind in so many parts of learning did not fail him, when his thoughts turned to the great world outside our narrow seas. It was his poverty that confined him so long to the neighbourhood of Temple Bar. He must in these early days have sometimes felt with Arviragus when he says: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;What should we speak of<br/>When we are old as you? when we shall hear<br/>The rain and wind beat dark December, how<br/>In this our pinching cave, shall we discourse<br/>The freezing hours away? We have seen nothing.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">With his pension his wanderings at once began. His friendship with the Thrales gave them a still wider range. His curiosity, which in itself was always eager, was checked in his more prosperous circumstances by his years, his natural unwillingness at any one moment to make an effort, and by the want of travelling companions who were animated by a spirit of inquiry and of enterprise equal to his own. He did indeed travel much more than is commonly thought, and was far less frequently to be seen rolling along Fleet-street or stemming the full tide of human existence at Charing Cross than his biographers would have us believe.</p>
<p class="p24">The following table, imperfect though it must necessarily be, shows how large a part of his life he passed outside &lsquo;the first turnpike-gate,&rsquo; and beyond the smoke of London: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">1709-1736. The first twenty-seven years of his life he spent in small country towns or villages &mdash; Lichfield, Stourbridge, Oxford, Market-Bosworth, Birmingham. So late as 1781 Lichfield did not contain 4,000 inhabitants (Harwood&rsquo;s <span class="t8">History of Lichfield</span>, p. 380); eight years later it was reckoned that a little over 8,000 people dwelt in Oxford (Parker&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Early History of Oxford</span>, ed. 1885, p. 229). In 1732 or 1733 Birmingham, when Johnson first went to live there, had not, I suppose, a population of 10,000. Its growth was wonderfully rapid. Between 1770 and 1797 its inhabitants increased from 30,000 to nearly 80,000 (<span class="t8">Birmingham Directory for</span> 1780, p. xx, and <span class="t8">A Brief History of Birmingham</span>, p. 8).</p>
<p class="p24">1736-7. The first eighteen months of his married life he lived quite in the country at Edial, two miles from Lichfield. <span class="t8">Ante</span>, i. 97.</p>
<p class="p24">1737. He was twenty-eight years old when he removed to London. <span class="t8">Ante</span>, i. 110.</p>
<p class="p24">1739. He paid a visit to Appleby in Leicestershire and to Ashbourn. <span class="t8">Ante</span>, i. 82, 133 note 1.</p>

<p class="p24">Either this year or the next Johnson made the acquaintance of the Thrales. For the next seventeen years he had &lsquo;an apartment appropriated to him in the Thrales&rsquo; villa at Streatham&rsquo; (<span class="t8">ante</span>, i. 493), a handsome house that stood in a small park. Streatham was a quiet country-village, separated by wide commons from London, on one of which a highwayman had been hanged who had there robbed Mr. Thrale (<span class="t8">ante</span>, iii. 239, note 2). According to Mrs. Piozzi Johnson commonly spent the middle of the week at their house, coming on the Monday night and returning to his own home on the Saturday (<span class="t8">post</span>, iv. 169, note 3). Miss Burney, in 1778, describes him &lsquo;as living almost wholly at Streatham&rsquo; (<span class="t8">ante</span>, i. 493, note 3). No doubt she was speaking chiefly of the summer half of the year, for in the winter time the Thrales would be often in their town house, where he also had his apartment. Mr. Strahan complained of his being at Streatham &lsquo;in a great measure absorbed from the society of his old friends&rsquo; (<span class="t8">ante</span>, iii. 225). He used to call it &lsquo;my <span class="t8">home</span>&rsquo; (<span class="t8">ante</span>, i. 493, note 3).</p>

<p class="p24">That he was always eager to see the world is shown by many a passage in his writings and by the testimony of his biographers. How Macaulay, who knew his <span class="t8">Boswell</span> so well, could have accused him of &lsquo;speaking of foreign travel with the fierce and boisterous contempt of ignorance&rsquo; would be a puzzle indeed, did we not know how often this great rhetorician was by the stream of his own mighty rhetoric swept far away from the unadorned strand of naked truth. To his unjust and insulting attack I shall content myself with opposing the following extracts which with some trouble I have collected: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">1728 or 1729. Johnson in his undergraduate days was one day overheard saying: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I have a mind to see what is done in other places of learning. I&rsquo;ll go and visit the Universities abroad. I&rsquo;ll go to France and Italy. I&rsquo;ll go to Padua.&rsquo; <span class="t8">Ante</span>, i. 73.</p>
<p class="p24">1734. &lsquo;A generous and elevated mind is distinguished by nothing more certainly than an eminent degree of curiosity, nor is that curiosity ever more agreeably or usefully employed than in examining the laws and customs of foreign nations.&rsquo; <span class="t8">Ante</span>, i. 89.</p>
<p class="p24">1751. &lsquo;Curiosity is one of the permanent and certain characteristicks of a vigorous intellect.&rsquo; <span class="t8">Rambler</span>, No. 103. &lsquo;Curiosity is in great and generous minds the first passion and the last; and perhaps always predominates in proportion to the strength of the contemplative faculties.&rsquo; <span class="t8">Ib</span>. No. 150.</p>
<p class="p24">1752. Francis Barber, describing Johnson&rsquo;s friends in 1752, says: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;There was a talk of his going to Iceland with Mr. Diamond, which would probably have happened had he lived.&rsquo; <span class="t8">Ante</span>, i. 242. Johnson, in a letter to the wife of the poet Smart, says, &lsquo;we have often talked of a voyage to Iceland.&rsquo; <span class="t8">Post</span>, iv. 359 note. Mrs. Thrale wrote to him when he was in the Hebrides in 1773:&mdash; &lsquo;Well! &rsquo;tis better talk of Iceland. Gregory challenges you for an Iceland expedition; but I trust there is no need; I suppose good eyes might reach it from some of the places you have been in.&rsquo; <span class="t8">Piozzi Letters</span>, i. 188.</p>
<p class="p24">1761. Johnson wrote to Baretti: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I wish you had staid longer in Spain, for no country is less known to the rest of Europe.&rsquo; <span class="t8">Ante</span>, i. 365. He twice recommended Boswell to perambulate Spain. <span class="t8">Ante</span>, i. 410, 455.</p>
<p class="p24">1763. &lsquo;Dr. Johnson flattered me (Boswell) with some hopes that he would, in the course of the following summer, come over to Holland, and accompany me in a tour through the Netherlands.&rsquo; <span class="t8">Ante</span>, i. 470.</p>
<p class="p24">1772. He said that he had had some desire, though he soon laid it aside, to go on an expedition round the world with Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander. <span class="t8">Ante</span>, ii. 147.</p>
<p class="p24">1773. &lsquo;Dr. Johnson and I talked of going to Sweden.&rsquo; Boswell&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Hebrides</span>, <span class="t8">post</span>, v. 215.</p>
<p class="p24">On Sept. 9, 1777, Boswell wrote to Johnson: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I shrink a little from our scheme of going up the Baltick: I am sorry you have already been in Wales; for I wish to see it.&rsquo; <span class="t8">Ante</span>, iii. 134. Four days later Johnson wrote to Mrs. Thrale:&mdash; &lsquo;Boswell shrinks from the Baltick expedition, which, I think, is the best scheme in our power: what we shall substitute I know not. He wants to see Wales; but except the woods of Bachycraigh (<span class="t8">post</span>, v. 436), what is there in Wales, that can fill the hunger of ignorance, or quench the thirst of curiosity? We may, perhaps, form some scheme or other; but in the phrase of <span class="t8">Hockley in the Hole</span>, it is a pity he has not a <span class="t8">better bottom</span>.&rsquo; <span class="t8">Ib</span>. note 1.</p>
<p class="p24">Boswell writes: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Martin&rsquo;s account of the Hebrides had impressed us with a notion that we might there contemplate a system of life almost totally different from what we had been accustomed to seeâ€¦. Dr. Johnson told me that his father put Martin&rsquo;s account into his hands when he was very young, and that he was much pleased with it.&rsquo; <span class="t8">Post</span>, v. 13.</p>
<p class="p24">From the Hebrides Johnson wrote to Mrs. Thrale: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I have a desire to instruct myself in the whole system of pastoral life; but I know not whether I shall be able to perfect the idea. However, I have many pictures in my mind, which I could not have had without this journey; and should have passed it with great pleasure had you, and Master, and Queeney been in the party. We should have excited the attention and enlarged the observation of each other, and obtained many pleasing topicks of future conversation.&rsquo; <span class="t8">Piozzi Letters</span>, i. 159. &lsquo;We travelled with very little light in a storm of wind and rain; we passed about fifty-five streams that crossed our way, and fell into a river that, for a very great part of our road, foamed and roared beside us; all the rougher powers of nature except thunder were in motion, but there was no danger. I should have been sorry to have missed any of the inconveniencies, to have had more light or less rain, for their co-operation crowded the scene and filled the mind.&rsquo; <span class="t8">Ib</span>. p. 177.</p>
<p class="p24">See <span class="t8">post</span>, v. 334 for the splendid passage in which, describing the emotions raised in his mind by the sight of Iona, he says: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Whatever withdraws us from the power of our senses, whatever makes the past, the distant, or the future predominate over the present, advances us in the dignity of thinking beingsâ€¦. That man is little to be envied whose patriotism would not gain force upon the plains of Marathon, or whose piety would not grow warmer among the ruins of Iona.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Macaulay seems to have had the echo of these lines still in his ear, when he described imagination as &lsquo;that noble faculty whereby man is able to live in the past and in the future, in the distant and in the unreal.&rsquo; <span class="t8">Essays</span>, ed. 1853, iii. 167.</p>
<p class="p24">1774. When he saw some copper and iron works in Wales he wrote: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I have enlarged my notions.&rsquo; <span class="t8">Post</span>, v. 442. See also <span class="t8">ante</span>, iii. 164.</p>
<p class="p24">His letter to Warren Hastings shows his curiosity about India. <span class="t8">Ante,</span> iv. 68.</p>
<p class="p24">1775. The Thrales had just received a sum of Â£14,000. Johnson wrote to Mrs. Thrale: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;If I had money enough, what would I do? Perhaps, if you and master did not hold me, I might go to Cairo, and down the Red Sea to Bengal, and take a ramble to India. Would this be better than building and planting? It would surely give more variety to the eye, and more amplitude to the mind. Half fourteen thousand would send me out to see other forms of existence, and bring me back to describe them.&rsquo; <span class="t8">Piozzi Letters</span>, i. 266.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Regions mountainous and wild, thinly inhabited and little cultivated, make a great part of the earth, and he that has never seen them must live unacquainted with much of the face of nature, and with one of the great scenes of human existence.&rsquo; Johnson&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Works</span>, ix. 36. &lsquo;All travel has its advantages. If the traveller visits better countries he may learn to improve his own; and if fortune carries him to worse he may learn to enjoy it.&rsquo; <span class="t8">Ib</span>. p. 136.</p>
<p class="p24">To Dr. Taylor he wrote: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I came back last Tuesday from France. Is not mine a kind of life turned upside down? Fixed to a spot when I was young, and roving the world when others are contriving to sit still, I am wholly unsettled. I am a kind of ship with a wide sail, and without an anchor.&rsquo; <span class="t8">Ante</span>, ii. 387, note 2.</p>
<p class="p24">1776. In the spring of this year everything was settled for his journey to Italy with the Thrales. Hannah More wrote (<span class="t8">Memoirs</span>, i. 74): &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Johnson and Mr. Boswell have this day set out for Oxford, Lichfield, &amp;c., that the Doctor may take leave of all his old friends previous to his great expedition across the Alps. I lament his undertaking such a journey at his time of life, with beginning infirmities. I hope he will not leave his bones on classic grounds.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Boswell tells how &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Speaking with a tone of animation Johnson said, &ldquo;We must, to be sure, see Rome, Naples, Florence, and Venice, and as much more as we can.&rdquo;&rsquo; <span class="t8">Ante</span>, iii. 19.</p>
<p class="p26">When the journey was put off by the sudden death of Mr. Thrale&rsquo;s son,<br/>Boswell wrote: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I perceived that he had so warmly cherished the hope of enjoying classical scenes, that he could not easily part with the scheme; for he said, &ldquo;I shall probably contrive to get to Italy some other way.&rdquo;&rsquo; <span class="t8">Ib</span>. p. 28.</p>
<p class="p24">A day later Boswell wrote: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;A journey to Italy was still in his thoughts. He said, &ldquo;A man who has not been in Italy is always conscious of an inferiority, from his not having seen what it is expected a man should see. The grand object of travelling is to see the shores of the Mediterranean.&rdquo;&rsquo; <span class="t8">Ib</span>. p. 36. &lsquo;Johnson&rsquo;s desire to go abroad, particularly to see Italy, was very great; and he had a longing wish, too, to leave some Latin verses at the Grand Chartreux. He loved indeed the very act of travellingâ€¦. He was in some respects an admirable companion on the road, as he piqued himself upon feeling no inconvenience, and on despising no accommodations.&rsquo; Piozzi&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Anec</span>. p. 168.</p>
<p class="p26">Johnson, this same year, speaking of a friend who had gone to the East<br/>Indies, said: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I had some intention of accompanying him. Had I thought then as I do now, I should have gone.&rsquo; <span class="t8">Ante</span>, iii. 20. According to Mr. Tyers he once offered to attend another friend to India. Moreover &lsquo;he talked much of travelling into Poland to observe the life of the Palatines, the account of which struck his curiosity very much.&rsquo; <span class="t8">Johnsoniana</span>, ed. 1836, p. 157.</p>
<p class="p24">1777. Boswell wrote to Johnson this year (<span class="t8">ante</span>, iii. 107): &mdash; </p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;You have, I believe, seen all the cathedrals in England except that of<br/>Carlisle.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">This was not the case, yet most of them he had already seen or lived to see. With Lichfield, Oxford, and London he was familiar. Winchester and Exeter he had seen in 1762 on his tour to Devonshire (<span class="t8">ante</span>, i. 377), Peterborough, Ely, Lincoln, York, and Durham he no doubt saw in 1773 on his way to Scotland. The first three he might also have seen in 1764 on his visit to Langton (<span class="t8">ante</span>, i. 476). Chester, St. Asaph, Bangor, and Worcester he visited in 1774 in his journey to Wales (<span class="t8">post</span>, v. 435, 436, 448, 456). Through Canterbury he almost certainly passed in 1775 on his way to France (<span class="t8">ante</span>, ii. 384). Bristol he saw in 1776 (<span class="t8">ante</span>, iii. 51). To Chichester he drove from Brighton in 1782 (<span class="t8">post</span>, iv. 160). Rochester and Salisbury he visited in the summer of 1783 (<span class="t8">post</span>, iv. 233). Wells he might easily have seen when he was at Bath in 1776 (<span class="t8">ante</span>, iii. 44), and possibly Gloucester. Through Norwich he perhaps came on his return from Lincolnshire in 1764 (<span class="t8">ante</span>, i. 476). Hereford, I think, he could not have visited.</p>
<p class="p24">When in the September of this year Johnson and Boswell were driving in Dr. Taylor&rsquo;s chaise to Derby, &lsquo;Johnson strongly expressed his love of driving fast in a post-chaise. &ldquo;If,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I had no duties, and no reference to futurity, I would spend my life in driving briskly in a post-chaise with a pretty woman; but she should be one who could understand me, and would add something to the conversation&rdquo;&rsquo; (<span class="t8">ante</span>, iii. 162). He had previously said (<span class="t8">ante</span>, ii. 453), as he was driven rapidly along in a post-chaise, &lsquo;Life has not many things better than this.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">1778. Boswell wrote to Johnson: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;My wife is so different from you and me that she dislikes travelling.&rsquo; <span class="t8">Ante</span>, iii. 219.</p>
<p class="p24">Later on in the year Boswell records: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Dr. Johnson expressed a particular enthusiasm with respect to visiting the wall of China. I catched it for the moment, and said I really believed I should go and see the wall of China had I not children, of whom it was my duty to take care. &ldquo;Sir, (said he,) by doing so you would do what would be of importance in raising your children to eminence. There would be a lustre reflected upon them from your spirit and curiosity. They would be at all times regarded as the children of a man who had gone to view the wall of China. I am serious, Sir.&rdquo;&rsquo; <span class="t8">Ante</span>, iii. 269.</p>
<p class="p24">1780. In August he wrote to Boswell: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I know not whether I shall get a ramble this summerâ€¦. I hope you and I may yet shew ourselves on some part of Europe, Asia, or Africa.&rsquo; <span class="t8">Ante</span>, iii. 435.</p>
<p class="p24">In the same year Johnson wrote to Mrs. Thrale: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I hope you have no design of stealing away to Italy before the election, nor of leaving me behind you; though I am not only seventy, but seventy-one.&rsquo; <span class="t8">Piozzi Letters</span>, ii. 177.</p>
<p class="p24">On Oct. 17 he wrote: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The summer has been foolishly lost, like many other of my summers and winters. I hardly saw a green field, but staid in town to work, without working much.&rsquo; <span class="t8">Ante</span>, iii. 441.</p>
<p class="p24">1784. Johnson&rsquo;s wish to go to Italy in the last year of his life was caused by the hope that it might be good for his health. &lsquo;I do not,&rsquo; he wrote, &lsquo;travel for pleasure or curiosity; yet if I should recover,&rsquo; he added, &lsquo;curiosity would revive.&rsquo; <span class="t8">Post</span>, iv. 348.</p>
<p class="p24">Mrs. Piozzi, without however giving the year, records: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Dr. Johnson was very angry with a gentleman at our house for not being better company, and urged that he had travelled into Bohemia and seen Prague. &ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; added he, &ldquo;the man who has seen Prague might tell us something new and something strange, and not sit silent for want of matter to put his lips in motion.&rdquo;&rsquo; Piozzi&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Journey</span>, ii. 317.</p>
<p class="p24">All these passages shew, what indeed is evident enough from the text, that it was not travelling in general but travelling between the ages of nineteen and twenty-four, with a character unformed, a memory unstored, and a judgment untrained, that Johnson attacked. It was a common habit in his day to send young men of fortune to make the tour of Europe, as it was called, at an age when they would now be sent to either Oxford or Cambridge. Lord Charlemont was but eighteen when he left England. Locke, at the end of his work on <span class="t8">Education</span>, said in 1692 much the same as Johnson said in 1778.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The ordinary time of travel,&rsquo; he wrote, &lsquo;is from sixteen to one and twenty.&rsquo; He would send any one either at a younger age than sixteen under a tutor, or at an older age than twenty-one without a tutor; &lsquo;when he is of age to govern himself, and make observations of what he finds in other countries worthy his notice â€¦ and when, too, being thoroughly acquainted with the laws and fashions, the natural and moral advantages and defects of his own country, he has something to exchange with those abroad, from whose conversation he hoped to reap any knowledge.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Goldsmith, in his <span class="t8">Present State of Polite Learning</span>, ch. xiii, wrote in 1759: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;We see more of the world by travel, but more of human nature by remaining at homeâ€¦. A youth just landed at the Brille resembles a clown at a puppet-show; carries his amazement from one miracle to another; from this cabinet of curiosities to that collection of pictures; but wondering is not the way to grow wiseâ€¦. The greatest advantages which result to youth from travel are an easy address, the shaking off national prejudices, and the finding nothing ridiculous in national peculiarities. The time spent in these acquisitions could have been more usefully employed at home.&rsquo; Gibbon (<span class="t8">Misc. Works</span>, i. 197) says that &lsquo;the previous and indispensable requisites of foreign travel are age, judgment, a competent knowledge of men and books, and a freedom from domestic prejudices.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">When he was only eighteen years old he saw the evils of early travelling: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I never liked young travellers; they go too raw to make any great remarks, and they lose a time which is (in my opinion) the most precious part of a man&rsquo;s life.&rsquo; <span class="t8">Ib</span>. p. 98.</p>
<p class="p24">Cowper, in his <span class="t8">Progress of Error</span> (ed. 1782, i. 60), describes how &mdash; </p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;His stock, a few French phrases got by heart,<br/>With much to learn and nothing to impart,<br/>The youth obedient to his sire&rsquo;s commands,<br/>Sets off a wanderer into foreign lands.</p>
<p class="p10">* * * * *</p>
<p class="p26">Returning he proclaims by many a grace,<br/>By shrugs and strange contortions of his face,<br/>How much a dunce that has been sent to roam<br/>Excels a dunce that has been kept at home.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">APPENDIX C.</span></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">ELECTION OF LORD MAYORS OF LONDON.</span></p>
<p class="p24">(<span class="t8">Page</span> 356.)</p>
<p class="p24">In the years 1751-2-3, the Lord Mayor was not appointed by rotation; Sir G. Champion, the senior Alderman, being accused of a leaning towards Spain. From 1754 to 1765 (inclusive) if there was in any year a contest, yet in each case the senior Alderman nominated was chosen. From 1766 to 1775 (inclusive) there was in every year a departure from the order of seniority. In 1776-8 the order of seniority was again observed; so that two years before Johnson made his remark the irregularity had come to an end. This information I owe to the kindness of Mr. Scott, the excellent Chamberlain of the City. Sir George Champion had been passed over in the year 1739 also. In an address to the Liverymen he says that &lsquo;the disorders and great disturbance to the peace of the city, which in former times had been occasioned by the over-eagerness of some, too ambitious and impatient to obtain this great honour, had been quieted&rsquo; by the adoption of the order of seniority. <span class="t8">Gent. Mag</span>. 1739, p. 595. Among the Lord Mayors from 1769-1775 (inclusive) we find Beckford, Trecothick, Crosby, Townshend, Bull, Wilkes, and Sawbridge. &lsquo;Where did Beckford and Trecothick learn English?&rsquo; asked Johnson (<span class="t8">ante</span>, iii. 76). Crosby, in the year of his mayoralty (1770-1), was committed to the Tower by the House of Commons, for having himself committed to prison a messenger of the House when attempting to arrest the printer of the <span class="t8">London Evening Debates</span>, who was accused of a breach of privilege in reporting the Debates (<span class="t8">Parl. Hist</span>. xvii. 155). Townshend in the same year refused to pay the land-tax, on the plea that his county (Middlesex) was no longer represented, as Wilkes&rsquo;s election had been annulled (<span class="t8">Walpole&rsquo;s Letters</span>, v. 348). Bull in the House of Commons violently attacked Lord North&rsquo;s ministry (<span class="t8">Parl. Hist</span>. xix. 980). Sawbridge, year after year, brought into Parliament a bill for shortening the duration of parliaments. During his Mayoralty he would not suffer the pressgangs to enter the city. (Walpole&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Journal of the Reign of George III</span>, ii. 84.)</p>
<p class="p24">Among the Aldermen the Court-party had a majority. In April 1769 Wilkes&rsquo;s eligibility for election as an Alderman was not allowed by a majority of ten to six (Walpole&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Memoirs of the Reign of George III</span>, iii. 360, and <span class="t8">Ann. Reg</span>. xii. 92). On his release from prison in April 1770 he was, however, admitted without a division (<span class="t8">ib</span>. xiii. 99). When, in March 1770, the City presented an outspoken remonstrance to the King, sixteen Aldermen protested against it (Walpole&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Letters</span>, v. 229). About this time there arose a great division in the popular party in the City. According to Lord Albemarle, in his <span class="t8">Memoirs of Rockingham</span>, ii. 209, from the period of this struggle &lsquo;the Whigs and what are now called Radicals became two distinct sections of the Liberal party.&rsquo; Townshend, who in this followed the lead of Lord Shelburne, headed the more moderate men against Wilkes. The result was that in 1771 each section running a candidate for the Mayoralty, a third man, Nash, who was opposed to both, was returned (Walpole&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Memoirs of the Reign of George III</span>, iv. 345, and <span class="t8">Ann. Reg</span>. xiv. 146).</p>
<p class="p24">The Livery, for a time at least, was Wilkite. Wilkes&rsquo;s name was sent up as Lord Mayor at the top of the list in 1772 and 1773, but he was in each case passed over by the Court of Aldermen. It was not till 1774 that he was elected by a kind of &lsquo;Hobson&rsquo;s choice.&rsquo; The Aldermen had to choose between him and the retiring Lord Mayor, Bull. Walpole, writing of Nov. 1776, says the new Lord Mayor &lsquo;invited the Ministers to his feast, to which they had not been asked for seven years&rsquo; (<span class="t8">Journal of the Reign of George III</span>, ii. 84). See Boswell&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Hebrides</span>, <span class="t8">post</span>, v. 339.</p>

<p class="p26">THE INMATES OF JOHNSON&rsquo;S HOUSE.<br/>(Page 368.)</p>
<p class="p24">In September of this year (1778) Miss Burney records the following conversation at Streatham:&mdash; &lsquo;MRS. THRALE. &ldquo;Pray, Sir, how does Mrs. Williams like all this tribe?&rdquo; DR. J. &ldquo;Madam, she does not like them at all; but their fondness for her is not greater. She and Desmoulins quarrel incessantly; but as they can both be occasionally of service to each other, and as neither of them have any other place to go to, their animosity does not force them to separate.&rdquo; â€¦ MR. T. &ldquo;And pray who is clerk of your kitchen, Sir?&rdquo; DR. J. &ldquo;Why, Sir, I am afraid there is none; a general anarchy prevails in my kitchen, as I am told by Mr. Levett, who says it is not now what it used to be.&rdquo; MRS. T. &ldquo;Mr. Levett, I suppose, Sir, has the office of keeping the hospital in health, for he is an apothecary.&rdquo; DR. J. &ldquo;Levett, Madam, is a brutal fellow, but I have a good regard for him; for his brutality is in his manners, not his mind.&rdquo; MR. T. &ldquo;But how do you get your dinners drest?&rdquo; DR. J. &ldquo;Why, Desmoulins has the chief management of the kitchen; but our roasting is not magnificent, for we have no jack.&rdquo; MR. T. &ldquo;No jack! Why, how do they manage without?&rdquo; DR. J. &ldquo;Small joints, I believe, they manage with a string, and larger are done at the tavern. I have some thoughts (with a profound gravity) of buying a jack, because I think a jack is some credit to a house.&rdquo; MR. T. &ldquo;Well, but you&rsquo;ll have a spit too.&rdquo; DR. J. &ldquo;No, Sir, no; that would be superfluous; for we shall never use it; and if a jack is seen, a spit will be presumed.&rdquo; MRS. T. &ldquo;But pray, Sir, who is the Poll you talk of? She that you used to abet in her quarrels with Mrs. Williams, and call out, <span class="t8">At her again, Poll! Never flinch, Poll!</span>&rdquo; DR. J. &ldquo;Why, I took to Poll very well at first, but she won&rsquo;t do upon a nearer examination.&rdquo; MRS. T. &ldquo;How came she among you, Sir?&rdquo; DR. J. &ldquo;Why, I don&rsquo;t rightly remember, but we could spare her very well from us. Poll is a stupid slut. I had some hopes of her at first; but when I talked to her tightly and closely, I could make nothing of her; she was wiggle waggle, and I could never persuade her to be categorical.&rdquo;&rsquo; Mme. D&rsquo;Arblay&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Diary,</span> i. 114.</p>
<p class="p24">More than a year later Johnson wrote to Mrs. Thrale:&mdash; &lsquo;Discord keeps her residence in this habitation, but she has for some time been silent. We have much malice, but no mischief. Levett is rather a friend to Williams, because he hates Desmoulins more. A thing that he should hate more than Desmoulins is not to be found.&rsquo; <span class="t8">Piozzi Letters</span>, ii. 80. Mrs. Piozzi (<span class="t8">Anec</span>. p. 213) says:&mdash; &lsquo;He really was oftentimes afraid of going home, because he was so sure to be met at the door with numberless complaints; and he used to lament pathetically to me that they made his life miserable from the impossibility he found of making theirs happy, when every favour he bestowed on one was wormwood to the rest. If, however, I ventured to blame their ingratitude, and condemn their conduct, he would instantly set about softening the one and justifying the other; and finished commonly by telling me, that I knew not how to make allowances for situations I never experienced.&rsquo; Hawkins (<span class="t8">Life</span>, p. 404) says:&mdash; &lsquo;Almost throughout Johnson&rsquo;s life poverty and distressed circumstances seemed to be the strongest of all recommendations to his favour. When asked by one of his most intimate friends, how he could bear to be surrounded by such necessitous and undeserving people as he had about him, his answer was, &ldquo;If I did not assist them, no one else would, and they must be lost for want.&rdquo;&rsquo; &lsquo;His humanity and generosity, in proportion to his slender income, were,&rsquo; writes Murphy (<span class="t8">Life</span>, p. 146), &lsquo;unbounded. It has been truly said that the lame, the blind, and the sorrowful found in his house a sure retreat.&rsquo; See also <span class="t8">ante</span>, iii. 222. At the same time it must be remembered that while Mrs. Desmoulins and Miss Carmichael only brought trouble into the house, in the society of Mrs. Williams and Levett he had real pleasure. See <span class="t8">ante</span>, i. 232, note 1, and 243, note 3.</p>

<p class="p24">&lsquo;I have always loved the Arts, and during my travels on the Continent I did not neglect the opportunities which I had of cultivating a taste for them.

<p class="p24">&lsquo;Be assured, Gentlemen, that as I am proud to be a member of an Academy which has the peculiar felicity of not being at all dependant on a Minister, but under the immediate patronage and superintendence of the Sovereign himself, I shall be zealous to do every thing in my power that can be of any service to our excellent Institution.</p>
