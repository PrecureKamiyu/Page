<p class="p32">Powder the calx of cobalt, very fine, and mix it with three times its weight of powdered flints, this being wetted with common water, the whole concretes into a solid mass called <span class="t8">zaffre</span>, which from its hardness has been mistaken for a native mineral. <span class="t8">Hill on Fossils.</span></p>

<p class="p33">Some carrytale, some pleaseman, some slight <span class="t8">zany</span>,<br/>Some mumblenews, some trencher knight, some Dick,<br/>Told our intents before. <span class="t8">Shakespeare.</span></p>
<p class="p33">Then write that I may follow, and so be<br/>Thy echo, thy debtor, thy foil, thy <span class="t8">zany</span>,<br/>I shall be thought, if mine like thine I shape,<br/>All the world&rsquo;s lion, though I be thy ape. <span class="t8">Donne.</span></p>

The common kinds of <span class="t8">zarnich</span> are green and yellow; and to this we owe the distinction of orpiment into these colours, though there is no such substance as green orpiment. <span class="t8">Zarnich</span> contains a large quantity of arsenick in it. <span class="t8">Hill&rsquo;s Materia Medica.</span></p>

<p class="p32">If I had had time to have made new liveries, I would have bestowed the thousand pound I borrowed of you: but it is no matter, this poor show doth better; this doth infer the <span class="t8">zeal</span> I had to see him. <span class="t8">Shakespeare&rsquo;s Henry IV.</span></p>
<p class="p33">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; O Cromwell, Cromwell!<br/>Had I but serv&rsquo;d my God with half the <span class="t8">zeal</span><br/>I serv&rsquo;d my king, he would not in mine age<br/>Have left me naked to mine enemies. <span class="t8">Shakespeare.</span></p>
<p class="p33">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Among the seraphims<br/>Abdiel, than whom none with more <span class="t8">zeal</span> ador&rsquo;d<br/>The Deity, and divine commands obey&rsquo;d,<br/>Stood up, and in a flame of <span class="t8">zeal</span> severe,<br/>The current of his fury thus oppos&rsquo;d. <span class="t8">Milton&rsquo;s Parad. Lost.</span></p>
<p class="p32"><span class="t8">Zeal</span>, the blind conductor of the will. <span class="t8">Dryden.</span></p>
<p class="p33">She with such a <span class="t8">zeal</span> the cause embrac&rsquo;d,<br/>As women, where they will, are all in haste;<br/>The father, mother, and the kin beside,<br/>Were overborne by the fury of the tide. <span class="t8">Dryden.</span></p>
<p class="p33">The princes applaud with a furious joy,<br/>And the king seiz&rsquo;d a flambeau with <span class="t8">zeal</span> to destroy. <span class="t8">Dryden.</span></p>
<p class="p32">Seriousness and <span class="t8">zeal</span> in religion is natural to the English. <span class="t8">Tillotson&rsquo;s Sermons.</span></p>
<p class="p32">Good men often blemish the reputation of their piety by over-acting some things in their religion; by an indiscreet <span class="t8">zeal</span> about things wherein religion is not concerned. <span class="t8">Tillotson</span>.</p>
<p class="p32">True <span class="t8">zeal</span> seems not to be any one single affection of the soul; but rather a strong mixture of many holy affections; rather a gracious constitution of the whole mind, than any one particular grace, swaying a devout heart, and filling it with all pious intentions; all not only uncounterfeit, but most fervent. <span class="t8">Sprat&rsquo;s Sermons.</span></p>
<p class="p32">When the sins of a nation have provoked God to forsake it, he suffers those to concur in the most pernicious counsels for enslaving conscience, who pretend to the greatest <span class="t8">zeal</span> for the liberty of it. <span class="t8">Stillingfleet.</span></p>

<p class="p32">The fury of <span class="t8">zealots</span>, intestine bitterness and division were the greatest occasion of the last fatal destruction of Jerusalem. <span class="t8">King Charles.</span></p>
<p class="p32">Are not those men too often the greatest <span class="t8">zealots</span> who are most notoriously ignorant? true zeal should always begin with true knowledge, and thence proceed to an unwearied passion, for what it once knows to be worthy of such passion. <span class="t8">Sprat.</span></p>
<p class="p32">No wonder that so many of these deluded <span class="t8">zealots</span> have been engaged in a cause which they at first abhorred, and have wished or acted for the success of an enterprize, that might have ended in the extirpation of the protestant religion. <span class="t8">Addison.</span></p>
<p class="p32"><span class="t25">Zeálous</span>. <span class="t8">adj.</span> [from <span class="t8">zeal</span>.] Ardently passionate in any cause.</p>
<p class="p32">Our hearts are right with God, and our intentions pious, if we act our temporal affairs with a desire no greater than our necessity, and in actions of religion we be <span class="t8">zealous</span>, active, and operative, so far as prudence will permit. <span class="t8">Taylor.</span></p>
<p class="p33">This day, at height of noon, came to my sphere,<br/>A spirit, <span class="t8">zealous</span>, as he seem&rsquo;d to know<br/>More of the Almighty&rsquo;s works. <span class="t8">Milton&rsquo;s Paradise Lost.</span></p>
<p class="p32">We should be not only devout towards God, but <span class="t8">zealous</span> towards men; endeavouring by all prudent means to recover them out of those snares of the devil, whereby they are taken captive. <span class="t8">Decay of Piety.</span></p>
<p class="p32">It is not at all good to be <span class="t8">zealous</span> against any person, but only against their crimes. It is better to be <span class="t8">zealous</span> for things than for persons: but then it should be only for good things; a rule that does certainly exclude all manner of zeal for ill things, all manner of zeal for little things. <span class="t8">Sprat&rsquo;s Sermons.</span></p>
<p class="p32">Being instructed only in the general, and <span class="t8">zealous</span> in the main design; and as finite beings, not admitted into the secrets of government, the last resorts of providence, or capable of discovering the final purposes of God, they must be sometimes ignorant of the means conducing to those ends in which alone they can oppose each other. <span class="t8">Dryden.</span></p>

<p class="p32">To enter into a party as into an order of friars, with so resigned an obedience to superiors, is very unsuitable with the civil and religious liberties we so <span class="t8">zealously</span> assert. <span class="t8">Swift.</span></p>
<p class="p32"><span class="t25">Zeálousness</span>. <span class="t8">n.s.</span> [from <span class="t8">zealous</span>.] The quality of being zealous.

<p class="p32">Thou whoreson <span class="t8">zed</span>, thou unnecessary letter. <span class="t8">Shakespeare.</span></p>

<p class="p33">Fond men! if we believe that men do live<br/>Under the <span class="t8">zenith</span> of both frozen poles,<br/>Though none come thence, advertisement to give,<br/>Why bear we not the like faith of our souls? <span class="t8">Davies.</span></p>

<p class="p33">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They are as gentle<br/>As <span class="t8">zephyrs</span> blowing below the violet. <span class="t8">Shakespeare&rsquo;s Cymbeline.</span></p>
<p class="p32"><span class="t8">Zephyr</span>, you shall see a youth with a merry countenance, holding in his hand a swan with wings displayed, as about to sing. <span class="t8">Peacham on Drawing.</span></p>
<p class="p33">Forth rush the levent and the potent winds,<br/>Eurus and <span class="t8">Zephyr.</span> <span class="t8">Milton.</span></p>
<p class="p32">Mild as when <span class="t8">Zephyrus</span> on Flora breathes. <span class="t8">Milton</span>.</p>

<p class="p32">It exceeds even their absurdity to suppose the <span class="t8">zodiack</span> and planets to be efficient of, and antecedent to themselves, or to exert any influences before they were in being. <span class="t8">Bentley.</span></p>
<p class="p33">Here in a shrine that cast a dazling light,<br/>Sat fixt in thought the mighty Stagyrite;<br/>His sacred head a radiant <span class="t8">zodiack</span> crown&rsquo;d;<br/>And various animals his sides surround. <span class="t8">Pope.</span></p>

<p class="p33">True love is still the same: the torrid <span class="t8">zones</span>,<br/>And those more frigid ones,<br/>It must not know:<br/>For love grown cold or hot,<br/>Is lust or friendship, not<br/>The thing we show;<br/>For that&rsquo;s a flame would die,<br/>Held down or up too high:<br/>Then think I love more than I can express,<br/>And would love more, could I but love thee less. <span class="t8">Suckling.</span></p>
