		<h1>Introduction to the Introduction</h1>
		<p>Following is the summary given by new bing. </p>
		<p>But before we start reading the summary, we should know some words.</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>genetic affiliation</b> which means to classify the Japanese language based on its origin. </li>
			<li><b>illogicality</b>, meaning that Japanese is not reasonable enough. </li>
			<li><b>modifier-head pattern</b>, meaning that the modifier is proceding the word that is being modified like 
			"Green apple" where green is modifier and the apple is the word being modified.</li>
			<li><b>Agglutinative</b>, relating to glue.</li>
			<li><b>Morphology</b>, studying the shape the form and formation of the word.</li>
			<li><b>syllables and moras</b>. Tokyo has two syllables but has four moras. Moras measure the length of prononcation</li>
			<li><b>accentual</b></li>
			<li><b>dichotomy</b>, meaning classification</li>	
			<li><b>Archetypical</b>, meaning emotion related.</li>

		<p>The text you provided discusses various aspects of the Japanese language, including its typological classification, grammatical structure, and word formation processes. Some of the main points covered in the text include:</p>
		<p>
		<ol>
			<li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Japanese is considered a language-isolate because its genetic affiliation to other languages or language families is not definitively known.</li>
			<li style = "margin-bottom: 10px;">Japanese has several myths associated with it, including its uniqueness, illogicality, and difficulty.
			</li>
			<li style = "margin-bottom: 10px;">From an overall structural point of view, Japanese is not unique but rather a typical human language with a basic word order of Subject-Object-Verb (SOV) and a modifier-head pattern followed by other grammatical elements.</li>
			<li style = "margin-bottom: 10px;">Japanese is classified as an agglutinative language due to its use of affixation in its verbal morphology.</li>
			<li style = "margin-bottom: 10px;"> These are just some of the main points covered in the text you provided. The text offers a detailed and nuanced perspective on the Japanese language and its various features and characteristics. </li>
			<li style = "margin-bottom: 10px;">Japanese has three types of word formation: lexical word formation, syntactic word formation, and post-syntactic word formation.</li>
			<li style = "margin-bottom: 10px;">The accentual system of Japanese involves two units of counting: syllables and moras.</li>
			<li style = "margin-bottom: 10px;">Japanese lies in the middle of the subject-topic dichotomy, possessing an archetypical topic construction while also having the notion of subject figure importantly in its syntactic organization.</li>

		<h2>Agglutinative language</h2>
		<p>An agglutinative language is a type of language in which words are formed by combining multiple morphemes (units of meaning) together through a process called affixation. In agglutinative languages, affixes such as prefixes or suffixes are added to a base word to create new words with different meanings. Each affix typically carries a single grammatical function or meaning, and the boundaries between affixes and the base word are usually clear and easily identifiable.</p>

		<p>Agglutinative languages are contrasted with other types of languages such as fusional languages, in which multiple grammatical functions or meanings can be expressed by a single affix and the boundaries between affixes and the base word are often less clear. Japanese is an example of an agglutinative language, as it involves a fair amount of affixation in its verbal morphology.</p>
		<h2>Tone</h2>
		<p>The text you provided discusses the use of tone as a typological classificatory feature in phonology. Tone refers to the use of pitch to distinguish the meaning of words in a language. If a textbook definition were applied to Japanese, most Japanese dialects would be classified as tone languages because the pitch of a syllable (whether it is high or low) can affect the meaning of a word to a certain extent.</p>

		<p>However, Japanese differs from archetypical tone languages like Chinese. In Chinese and other similar languages, it is necessary to specify the tone for each syllable. In Japanese, on the other hand, the pitch of each syllable in a phrase can be predicted given an accent marker and a set of rules.</p>

		<p>The accentual system of Japanese also involves two units of counting: syllables and moras. Moras are units of sound that have been lost in most European languages. The use of these units in the accentual system is one of the features that distinguishes different dialect groups within Japanese.</p>

		<h2>Syllables and Moras</h2>

		<p>The paragraph you provided discusses the accentual system of Japanese, which involves two units of counting: syllables and moras. Syllables are units of sound that typically consist of a vowel sound or a combination of consonant and vowel sounds. Moras, on the other hand, are units of sound that represent the timing or rhythm of speech. In Japanese, a single syllable can consist of one or two moras. For example, the word “Tokyo” has two syllables but four moras: “To-o-kyo-o.”

		<p>Moras are an important feature of the Japanese accentual system and are used to determine the placement of pitch accents in words and phrases. The use of moras in the accentual system is one of the features that distinguishes different dialect groups within Japanese. For example, some dialects have different rules for placing pitch accents based on the number of moras in a word.

		<p>Moras are not commonly used in most European languages, which have lost this feature of their sound systems. Instead, European languages typically rely on syllables as the primary unit of counting in their accentual systems.

		<h2>Word formation</h2>

		<p>The text you provided discusses the different types of word formation in Japanese. Japanese word formation involves various types of suffixes, some of which appear to have a syntactic basis. Japanese also has productive mechanisms for forming compounds, and one type of compound formation also seems to have syntactic relevance.

		<p>According to the text, three types of word formation need to be recognized in Japanese: lexical word formation, syntactic word formation, and post-syntactic word formation. Lexical word formation includes one type of compound formation and certain affixing processes. Syntactic word formation involves affixation with the honorific prefix as well as the causative and passive morphemes. Post-syntactic word formation involves another type of compound formation.

		<p>These different types of word formation in Japanese offer an interesting perspective on the relationship between morphology and syntax in the language.

		<h2>More on word formation</h2>

		<p>Lexical word formation, syntactic word formation, and post-syntactic word formation are three types of word formation processes that are mentioned in the text you provided.

		<p>Lexical word formation refers to the process of creating new words by combining existing words or morphemes in a language’s lexicon. This can include processes such as compounding, where two or more words are combined to create a new word with a distinct meaning. For example, in Japanese, the words “denwa” (telephone) and “bangou” (number) can be combined to form the compound word “denwabangou” (telephone number).

		<p>Syntactic word formation refers to the process of creating new words through the application of grammatical rules and operations. This can include processes such as affixation, where affixes such as prefixes or suffixes are added to a base word to create a new word with a different grammatical function. For example, in Japanese, the verb “taberu” (to eat) can be turned into its causative form “tabesaseru” (to make someone eat) by adding the causative suffix “-saseru.”

		<p>Post-syntactic word formation refers to the process of creating new words after the syntactic structure of a sentence has been determined. This can include processes such as compound formation, where two or more words are combined to create a new word after the syntactic structure of a sentence has been established.

		<p>These are just some examples of how lexical, syntactic, and post-syntactic word formation can work in Japanese. Each type of word formation involves different mechanisms and processes for creating new words and expressing different meanings and grammatical functions.
