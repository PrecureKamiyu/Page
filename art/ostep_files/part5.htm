The important thing for now: <b>your name could go here! </b>But, you have to help. So send us some feedback and help debug this book. And you could be famous! Or, at least, have your name in some book.</p><p class="s5" style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 11pt;text-align: justify;">The people who have helped so far include: Abhirami Senthilkumaran*, Adam Drescher, Adam Eggum, Ahmed Fikri*, Ajaykrishna Raghavan, Alex Wyler, Anand Mundada, B.

Special thanks to those marked with an asterisk above, who have gone above and beyond in their sugges-</p><p class="s5" style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: left;">tions for improvement.</p><p class="s5" style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 11pt;text-align: justify;">Special thanks to Professor Joe Meehean (Lynchburg) for his detailed notes on each chapter, to Professor Jerod Weinman (Grinnell) and his entire class for their incredible booklets, and to Professor Chien-Chung Shen (Delaware) for his invalu- able and detailed reading and comments about the book. All three have helped these authors immeasurably in the refinement of the materials herein.</p><p class="s5" style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 11pt;text-align: justify;">Also, many thanks to the hundreds of students who have taken 537 over the years. In particular, the Fall ’08 class who encouraged the first written form of these notes (they were sick of not having any kind of textbook to read – pushy students!), and then praised them enough for us to keep going (including one hi- larious “ZOMG! You should totally write a textbook!” comment in our course evaluations that year).</p><p class="s5" style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 11pt;text-align: justify;">A great debt of thanks is also owed to the brave few who took the xv6 project lab course, much of which is now incorporated into the main 537 course. From Spring ’09: Justin Cherniak, Patrick Deline, Matt Czech, Tony Gregerson, Michael Griepentrog, Tyler Harter, Ryan Kroiss, Eric Radzikowski, Wesley Reardan, Rajiv Vaidyanathan, and Christopher Waclawik. From Fall ’09: Nick Bearson, Aaron Brown, Alex Bird, David Capel, Keith Gould, Tom Grim, Jeffrey Hugo, Brandon Johnson, John Kjell, Boyan Li, James Loethen, Will McCardell, Ryan Szaroletta, Si-</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 68pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">mon Tso, and Ben Yule. From Spring ’10: Patrick Blesi, Aidan Dennis-Oehling, Paras Doshi, Jake Friedman, Benjamin Frisch, Evan Hanson, Pikkili Hemanth, Michael Jeung, Alex Langenfeld, Scott Rick, Mike Treffert, Garret Staus, Brennan Wall, Hans Werner, Soo-Young Yang, and Carlos Griffin (almost).</p><p class="s5" style="padding-left: 68pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: justify;">Although they do not directly help with the book, our graduate students have taught us much of what we know about systems. We talk with them regularly while they are at Wisconsin, but they do all the real work – and by telling us about what they are doing, we learn new things every week. This list includes the fol- lowing collection of current and former students with whom we published pa- pers; an asterisk marks those who received a Ph.D. under our guidance: Abhishek Rajimwale, Ao Ma, Brian Forney, Chris Dragga, Deepak Ramamurthi, Florentina Popovici*, Haryadi S. Gunawi*, James Nugent, John Bent*, Lanyue Lu, Lakshmi Bairavasundaram*, Laxman Visampalli, Leo Arulraj, Meenali Rungta, Muthian Si- vathanu*, Nathan Burnett*, Nitin Agrawal*, Sriram Subramanian*, Stephen Todd Jones*, Swaminathan Sundararaman*, Swetha Krishnan, Thanh Do, Thanumalayan</p><p class="s5" style="padding-left: 68pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">S. Pillai, Timothy Denehy*, Tyler Harter, Venkat Venkataramani, Vijay Chidambaram, Vijayan Prabhakaran*, Yiying Zhang*, Yupu Zhang*, Zev Weiss.</p><p class="s5" style="padding-left: 68pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: justify;">A final debt of gratitude is also owed to Aaron Brown, who first took this course many years ago (Spring ’09), then took the xv6 lab course (Fall ’09), and finally was a graduate teaching assistant for the course for two years or so (Fall ’10 through Spring ’12). His tireless work has vastly improved the state of the projects (par- ticularly those in xv6 land) and thus has helped better the learning experience for countless undergraduates and graduates here at Wisconsin. As Aaron would say (in his usual succinct manner): “Thx.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part4.htm">&lt; 上一个</a><span> | </span><a href="../ostep.html">内容</a><span> | </span><a href="part6.htm">下一个 &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
