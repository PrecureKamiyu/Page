<h2 class="h20"><a id="a2464"></a>CHAPTER I. JOHNSON AS A NATIONAL INSTITUTION</h2>
<p class="p21">The name of Samuel Johnson is, of course, not the greatest in English prose, but even to-day, when he has been dead more than a century and a quarter, it is still the most familiar. We live in an age of newspapers. Where all can read, the newspaper press, taken as a whole, will be a fairly accurate reflection of what is in the mind of a people. Nothing will be mentioned frequently in newspapers which is not of some interest to a large number of readers; and whatever is frequently mentioned there cannot fail to become widely known. Tried by this test, Johnson&rsquo;s name must be admitted to be very widely known and of almost universal interest. No man of letters &mdash; perhaps scarcely even Shakespeare himself &mdash; is so often quoted in the columns of the daily press. His is a name that may&nbsp; be safely introduced into any written or spoken discussion, without fear of the stare of unrecognizing ignorance; and the only danger to which those who quote him expose themselves is that of the yawn of over-familiarity. Even in his own lifetime his reputation extended far beyond the limited circle of literature or scholarship. Actresses delighted in his conversation; soldiers were proud to entertain him in their barracks; innkeepers boasted of his having slept in their inns. His celebrity was such that he himself once said there was hardly a day in which the newspapers did not mention his name; and a year after his death Boswell could venture to write publicly of him that his &ldquo;character, religious, moral, political and literary, nay his figure and manner, are, I believe, more generally known than those of almost any man.&rdquo; But what was, in his own day, partly a respect paid to the maker of the famous <span class="t8">Dictionary</span> and partly a curiosity about &ldquo;the great Oddity,&rdquo; as the Edensor innkeeper called him, has in the course of the nineteenth century become a great deal more.</p>
<p class="p24">He is still for us the great scholar and the strongly marked individuality, but he has gradually attained a kind of apotheosis, a kind of semi-legendary position, almost rivalling that of the great John Bull himself, as the&nbsp; embodiment of the essential features of the English character. We never think of the typical Englishman being like Shakespeare or Milton. In the first place, we know very little about Shakespeare, and not very much about Milton; and so we are thrown back on their works, and our mental picture of them takes on a dim and shadowy grandeur, very unlike what we see when we look within into our familiar and commonplace selves. Nor do Englishmen often plume themselves on their aesthetic or imaginative gifts. The achievements of Wren, or Purcell, or Keats may arouse in them admiration and pride, but never a sense of kinship. When they recognize themselves in the national literature, it is not Hamlet, or Lear, or Clarissa, or Ravenswood that holds up the mirror; but Falstaff, or The Bastard, or Tom Jones, or Jeanie Deans, or perhaps Gabriel Oak: plain people, all of them, whatever their differences, with a certain quiet and downright quality which Englishmen are apt to think the peculiar birthright of the people of this island. It is that quality which was the central thing in the mind of Johnson, and it is to his possession of it, and to our unique knowledge of it through Boswell, that more than anything else he owes this position of the typical Englishman among our men of letters. We can all imagine that&nbsp; under other conditions, and with an added store of brains and character, we might each have been Doctor Johnson. Before we could fancy ourselves Shelley or Keats the self that we know would have to be not developed but destroyed. But in Johnson we see our own magnified and glorified selves.</p>
<p class="p24">It has sometimes been asserted to be the function of the man of letters to say what others can feel or think but only he can express. Whatever may be thought of such a definition of literature, it is certain that Johnson discharged this particular function with almost unique success. And he continues to do so still, especially in certain fields. Whenever we feel strongly the point of view of common sense we almost expect to be able to find some trenchant phrase of Johnson&rsquo;s with which to express it. If it cannot be found it is often invented. A few years ago, a lover of Johnson walking along a London street passed by the side of a cabmen&rsquo;s shelter. Two cabmen were getting their dinner ready, and the Johnsonian was amused and pleased to hear one say to the other: &ldquo;After all, as Doctor Johnson says, a man may travel all over the world without seeing anything better than his dinner.&rdquo; The saying was new to him and probably apocryphal, though the sentiment is one which can well be imagined&nbsp; as coming from the great man&rsquo;s mouth. But whether apocryphal or authentic, the remark well illustrates both the extent and the particular nature of Johnson&rsquo;s fame. You would not find a cabman ascribing to Milton or Pope a shrewd saying that he had heard and liked. Is there any man but Johnson in all our literary history whom he would be likely to call in on such an occasion? That is the measure of Johnson&rsquo;s universality of appeal. And the secret of it lies, to use his own phrase, not used of himself of course, in the &ldquo;bottom of sense,&rdquo; which is the primary quality in all he wrote and said, and is not altogether absent from his ingrained prejudices, or even from the perversities of opinion which his love of argument and opposition so constantly led him to adopt. Whether right or wrong there is always something broadly and fundamentally human about him which appeals to all and especially to the plain man. Every one feels at home at once with a man who replies to doubts about the freedom of the will with the plain man&rsquo;s answer: &ldquo;Sir, we <span class="t8">know</span> our will&rsquo;s free, and there&rsquo;s an end on&rsquo;t,&rdquo; and if he adds to it an argument which the plain man would not have thought of, it is still one which the plain man and everyone else can understand. &ldquo;You are surer that you can lift up your finger or not as you please, than you are of any&nbsp; conclusion from a deduction of reasoning.&rdquo; Moreover we all think we are more honest than our neighbours and are at once drawn to the man who was less of a humbug than any man who ever lived. &ldquo;Clear your mind of cant&rdquo; is perhaps the central text of Johnson, on which he enlarged a hundred times. &ldquo;When a butcher tells you his heart bleeds for his country, he has in fact no uneasy feeling.&rdquo; No one who has ever attended an election meeting fails to welcome that saying, or the answer to Boswell&rsquo;s fears that if he were in Parliament he would be unhappy if things went wrong, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s cant, sir. . . . Public affairs vex no man.&rdquo; &ldquo;Have they not vexed yourself a little, sir? Have you not been vexed at all by the turbulence of this reign and by that absurd vote of the House of Commons, &lsquo;That the influence of the Crown has increased, is increasing, and ought to be diminished&rsquo;?&rdquo; &ldquo;Sir, I have never slept an hour less, nor eat an ounce less meat. I would have knocked the factious dogs on the head, to be sure; but I was not <span class="t8">vexed</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Here we all know where we are. This is what we wish we could have said ourselves, and can fancy ourselves saying under more favourable circumstances; and we like the man who says it for us. Certainly no man, not even Swift, ever put the plain man&rsquo;s view with&nbsp; such exactness, felicity, and force as Johnson does a thousand times in the pages of Boswell. And not only in the pages of Boswell. One of the objects of this introductory chapter is to try to give a preliminary answer to the very natural question which confronts every one who thinks about Johnson, how it has come about that a man whose works are so little read to-day should still be so great a name in English life. How is it that in this HOME UNIVERSITY LIBRARY he is the second author to have a volume to himself, only Shakespeare preceding him? The primary answer is, of course, that we know him, as we know no other man whose face we never saw, whose voice we never heard. Boswell boasted that he had &ldquo;Johnsonized the land,&rdquo; and that he had shown Johnson in his book as no man had ever been shown in a book before; and the boast is after a hundred years seen to be a literal statement of fact. But after all Boswell did not make Johnson&rsquo;s reputation. On the contrary, it was Johnson&rsquo;s name that sold Boswell&rsquo;s book. No man owes so much to his biographer as Johnson to Boswell, but that must not make us forget that Johnson was the most famous man of letters in England before he ever saw Boswell. Boswell&rsquo;s earnest desire to make his acquaintance and to sit humbly at his feet was only an extreme&nbsp; instance of an attitude of respect and admiration, often even of reverence, commonly felt towards him among the more intelligent and serious portion of the community. He had not then attained to the position of something like Dictatorship which he filled in the world of English letters at the time he wrote the <span class="t8">Lives of the Poets</span>, but, except the <span class="t8">Shakespeare</span> and the <span class="t8">Lives</span>, all the work that gave him that position was already done. In this case, as in others, fame increased in old age without any corresponding increase in achievement, and it was the easy years at Streatham, not the laborious years at Gough Square, that saw him honoured and courted by bishops and judges, peers and commoners, by the greatest of English statesmen and the greatest of English painters. But his kingship was in him from the first. He had been <span class="t8">anax andron</span> even among his schoolfellows. His bigness, in more ways than one, made them call him &ldquo;the great boy,&rdquo; and the father of one of them was astute enough even then to perceive that he would be more than that: &ldquo;you call him the great boy, but take my word for it, he will one day prove a great man.&rdquo; The boys looked upon him so much as a superior being to themselves that three of them, of whom one was his friend Hector, whom he often saw in later life, &ldquo;used to come in the morning as his humble&nbsp; attendants and carry him to school. One in the middle stooped while he sat upon his back, and one on each side supported him, and thus he was borne triumphant.&rdquo; Such a tribute by boys to intellectual superiority was less rare in those days than it has become since: but it would not be easy to find a parallel to it at any time. What began at school continued through life. Even when he was poorest and most obscure, there was something about him that secured respect. It is too little to say that no one ever imagined he could with impunity behave disrespectfully to Johnson. No one ever dared to do so. As he flung the well-meant boots from his door at Oxford, so throughout life he knew how to make all men afraid to insult, slight, or patronize him.</p>
<p class="p24">But these, after all, were qualities that would only affect the few who came into personal contact with him. What was it that affected the larger world and gave him the fame and authority of his later years? Broadly speaking of course it was what he had written, the work he had done, his poems, his <span class="t8">Rambler</span> and <span class="t8">Idler</span>, his <span class="t8">Rasselas</span>, his <span class="t8">Shakespeare</span>, above all that colossal and triumphant piece of single-handed labour, the <span class="t8">Dictionary of the English Language</span>. But there was more than that. Another man might have written&nbsp; books quite as valuable, and attained to nothing like Johnson&rsquo;s position. A thousand people to-day read what Gray was writing in those years for one who reads what Johnson wrote, and they are quite right. Yet Gray in his lifetime had little fame and no authority except among his friends. Pope, again, had of course immense celebrity, more no doubt than Johnson ever had among men of letters; but he never became, as Johnson did, something almost like a national institution. What was it that gave Johnson what great poets never attained? It could not yet be his reputation as a great talker, which was only beginning to spread. We think of him as the greatest talker the world has ever seen: but that is chiefly due to Boswell, of course, and we are speaking at present of the years before the memorable meeting in the back parlour of Mr. Davies&rsquo;s shop in Russell Street, Covent Garden. Besides, good talk, except in Boswell&rsquo;s pages, is like good acting, a vain thing to those who only know it by hearsay. We are therefore thrown back on Johnson&rsquo;s public work for an explanation of the position he held. What was it in his work, with so little of Pope&rsquo;s amazing wit and brilliancy, with so little of Gray&rsquo;s fine imaginative quality and distinction, prose too, in the main, and not poetry, with none of the prestige of poetry,&nbsp; that gave him what neither Pope nor Gray ever received, what it is scarcely too much to call, the homage of a nation?</p>
<p class="p24">The answer is that, especially in England, it is not brilliance or distinction of mind that win the respect of a nation. George III had many faults, but all through his reign he was an admirable representative of the general feelings of his people. And he never did a more representative act than when he gave Johnson a pension, or when he received him in the library of Buckingham House. No doubt many, though not all, of Johnson&rsquo;s political and ecclesiastical prejudices were very congenial to the king, but plenty of people shared George Ill&rsquo;s views without gaining from him an ounce of respect. What he and the nation dimly felt about Johnson was a quality belonging less to the author than to the man. The English, as we were saying just now, think of themselves as a plain people, more honest and direct in word and deed than the rest of the world. George III never affected to be anything but a plain man, was very honest according to his lights, and never for an instant failed to have the courage of his convictions. Such a king and such a people would inevitably be attracted to a man of Johnson&rsquo;s fearless sincerity and invincible common sense. The ideal of the nation is&nbsp; still the same. Johnson once praised the third Duke of Devonshire for his &ldquo;dogged veracity.&rdquo; We have lately seen one of that duke&rsquo;s descendants and successors, a man of no obvious or shining talents, attain to a position of almost unique authority among his fellow countrymen mainly by his signal possession of this hereditary gift of veracity, honesty and good sense. So it was with Johnson himself. Behind all his learning lay something which no learned language could conceal. &ldquo;On s&rsquo;attend à voir un auteur et on trouve un homme.&rdquo; Authors then, as now, were often thought to be fantastical, namby-pamby persons, living in dreams, sharing none of the plain man&rsquo;s interests, eager and querulous about trifles and unrealities, indifferent and incapable in the broad world of life. Nobody could feel that about Johnson.</p>
<p class="p24">He never pretended to be superior to the pains or pleasures of the body and never concealed his interest in the physical basis of life. He might with truth have spoken, as Pope did, of &ldquo;that long disease, my life,&rdquo; for he declares in one of his letters that after he was past twenty his health was such that he seldom enjoyed a single day of ease; and he was so scrupulously truthful when he had a pen in his hand that that must be taken as at the least a literal record of the truth as it appeared&nbsp; to him at that moment. But though he never enjoyed health he never submitted to the tyranny of disease. The manliness that rings through all he wrote made itself felt also in his life, and we are not surprised to hear from Mrs. Thrale, in whose house he lived so long, that he &ldquo;required less attendance sick or well than ever I saw any human creature.&rdquo; He could conquer disease and pain, but he never affected stoic &ldquo;braveries,&rdquo; about not finding them very actual and disagreeable realities. In the same way, he never pretended not to enjoy the universal pleasures, such as food and sleep. Boswell records him as saying: &ldquo;Some people have a foolish way of not minding, or pretending not to mind, what they eat. For my part, I mind my belly very studiously and very carefully, for I look upon it that he who does not mind his belly will hardly mind anything else.&rdquo; This is not particularly refined language, and Johnson&rsquo;s manners at the dinner-table, where, until he had satisfied his appetite, he was &ldquo;totally absorbed in the business of the moment,&rdquo; were not always of a nature to please refined people. But our present point is that they were only an exaggeration of that sense of bodily realities which is one of the things that has always helped to secure for him the plain man&rsquo;s confidence. Throughout his life he kept his&nbsp; feet firmly based on the solid ground of fact. Human life, as it is actually and visibly lived, was the subject of his study and conversation from first to last. He always put fine-spun theories to mercilessly positive tests such as the ordinary man understands and trusts at once, though ordinary men have not the quickness or clearness of mind to apply them. When people preached a theory to him he was apt to confute them simply by applying it to practice. He supposed them to act upon it, and its absurdity was demonstrated. One of his friends was Mrs. Macaulay, who was a republican and affected doctrines of the equality of all men. When Johnson was at her house one day he put on, as he says, &ldquo;a very grave countenance,&rdquo; and said to her: &ldquo;Madam, I am now become a convert to your way of thinking. I am convinced that all mankind are upon an equal footing; and to give you an unquestionable proof, madam, that I am in earnest, here is a very sensible, civil, well-behaved fellow-citizen, your footman: I desire that he may be allowed to sit down and dine with us.&rdquo; No wonder that, as he adds, &ldquo;she has never liked me since.&rdquo; To the political thinker, perhaps, such an argument rather proves the insincerity of Mrs. Macaulay than what he claimed for it, &ldquo;the absurdity of the levelling doctrine.&rdquo; But it exhibits,&nbsp; with a force that no theoretical reasoning could match, the difficulty which doctrines of equality will always have to meet in the resistance of human nature as it is and as it is likely to remain for a long time to come. And it illustrates the habit of Johnson&rsquo;s mind which has always made the unlearned hear him so gladly, the habit of forcing theory to the test of fact. For quick as he was, perhaps quicker than any recorded man, at the tierce and quart of theoretical argument, he commonly used the bludgeon stroke of practice to give his opponent the final blow. We are vaguely distrustful of our reasoning powers, but every man thinks he can understand facts and figures. The quickness of Johnson in applying arithmetical tests to careless statements must have been another of the elements in the fear, respect and confidence he inspired. A gentleman once told him that in France, as soon as a man of fashion marries, he takes an opera girl into keeping, and he declared this to be the general custom. &ldquo;Pray, sir,&rdquo; said Johnson, &ldquo;how many opera girls may there be?&rdquo; He answered, &ldquo;About four score.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well then, sir,&rdquo; replied Johnson, &ldquo;you see there can be no more than fourscore men of fashion who can do this.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">There is no art of persuasion, as all orators know, so overwhelming in effect as this appeal,&nbsp; or even appearance of appeal, to a court in which every man feels as much at home as the speaker himself. And though Johnson&rsquo;s use of it is, of course, seen at its most telling in his conversation, it was in him from the first, is a conspicuous feature of all he wrote, and was undoubtedly a powerful factor in winning for him the reputation of manliness and honesty he enjoyed. Take, for instance, a few paragraphs from his analysis of the rhetoric of authors on the subject of poverty. It is No. 202 of <span class="t8">The Rambler</span>. There is no better evidence of his perfect freedom from that slavery to words which is the besetting sin of authors.</p>
<p class="p24">&ldquo;There are few words of which the reader believes himself better to know the import than of <span class="t8">poverty</span>; yet whoever studies either the poets or philosophers will find such an account of the condition expressed by that term as his experience or observation will not easily discover to be true. Instead of the meanness, distress, complaint, anxiety and dependence, which have hitherto been combined in his ideas of poverty, he will read of content, innocence and cheerfulness, of health and safety, tranquillity and freedom; of pleasures not known but to men unencumbered with possessions; and of sleep that sheds his balsamick anodynes only on the&nbsp; cottage. Such are the blessings to be obtained by the resignation of riches, that kings might descend from their thrones and generals retire from a triumph, only to slumber undisturbed in the elysium of poverty.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">* * * * * *</p>
<p class="p24">&ldquo;But it will be found upon a nearer view that they who extol the happiness of poverty do not mean the same state with those who deplore its miseries. Poets have their imaginations filled with ideas of magnificence; and being accustomed to contemplate the downfall of empires, or to contrive forms of lamentation for monarchs in distress, rank all the classes of mankind in a state of poverty who make no approaches to the dignity of crowns. To be poor, in the epick language, is only not to command the wealth of nations, nor to have fleets and armies in pay.</p>
<p class="p24">&ldquo;Vanity has perhaps contributed to this impropriety of style. He that wishes to become a philosopher at a cheap rate easily gratifies his ambition by submitting to poverty when he does not feel it, and by boasting his contempt of riches when he has already more than he enjoys. He who would show the extent of his views and grandeur of his conceptions, or discover his acquaintance with splendour and magnificence, may talk, like Cowley, of an humble station and quiet&nbsp; obscurity, of the paucity of nature&rsquo;s wants, and the inconveniences of superfluity, and at last, like him, limit his desires to five hundred pounds a year; a fortune indeed, not exuberant, when we compare it with the expenses of pride and luxury, but to which it little becomes a philosopher to affix the name of poverty, since no man can with any propriety be termed poor who does not see the greater part of mankind richer than himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">What good sense, what resolute grip on the realities of life, what a love of truth and seriousness, shines through the long sentences! The form and language of the essay may perhaps be too suggestive of the professional author; but how much the opposite, how very human and real, is the stuff and substance of what he says! Professor Raleigh once proposed as a test of great literature, that it should be found applicable and useful in circumstances very different from those that were in the author&rsquo;s mind when he wrote. By that test these words of Johnson are certainly great literature. The degrees of wealth and poverty have varied infinitely in the history of the world. They were very different under the Roman Empire from what they became in the Middle Age; by Johnson&rsquo;s day they had become quite unlike what they had been in&nbsp; the days of Dante and Chaucer; and they have again changed almost or quite as much in the hundred and thirty years that have passed since he died. Yet was there ever a time, will there ever be, when the self-deception of the human heart or the loose thinking of the human mind, will not allow men who never knew poverty to boast of their cheerful endurance of it? Have we not to-day reached a time when men with an assured income of ten, twenty, or even thirty pounds a week, affect to consider themselves too poor to be able to afford to marry? And where will such people better find the needed recall to fact, than in Johnson&rsquo;s trenchant and unanswerable appeal to the obvious truth as all can see it, if they will, for themselves, in the visible conditions of the world about them: &ldquo;No man can, with any propriety, be termed poor who does not see the greater part of mankind richer than himself?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">This hold on the realities of life is the most essential element in Johnson&rsquo;s greatness. Ordinary people felt it from the first, however unconsciously, and looked to Johnson as something more than an author. Pope might do himself honour by acclaiming the verses of the unknown poet: Warburton might hasten to pay his tribute to the unknown critic: but they could not give Johnson, what neither&nbsp; of them could have gained for himself, the confidence, soon to be felt by the whole reading part of the population of England, that here was a man uniquely rich in the wisdom of every day, learned but no victim of learning, sincerely religious but with a religion that never tried to ignore the facts of human life, a scholar, a philosopher and a Christian, but also pre-eminently a man.</p>
<p class="p24">A grave man, no doubt, apt to deal in grave subjects, especially when he had his pen in his hand. But that helped rather than hindered his influence. He would not have liked to think that he owed part of his own authority to the sixteenth and seventeenth century Puritans, but no doubt he did. Still the Puritan movement only deepened a vein of seriousness which had been in the English from Saxon days. One may see it everywhere. The Puritans would not have been the power they were if they had not found congenial soil in the English character. The Reformation itself, a Protestant may be excused for thinking, owes its ultimate triumph in England partly to the fact that Englishmen saw in it a movement towards a more serious and ethical religion than the Catholicism either of the Middle Age or of the Jesuits. The same thing may be seen in the narrower fields of literature. The Renaissance&nbsp; on the whole takes a much more ethical note in England than, for instance, in France. A little later indeed, in the France of Pascal and Bossuet, books of devotion and theology were very widely read, as may be seen in the letters of Madame de Sévigné; but they can never have had anything like the circulation which they had in England, both in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Every one who looks at an English country-house library is struck by the abundant provision of sermons, mainly collected, like everything else indeed, in the eighteenth century. And every reader of Boswell&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Johnson</span> has been impressed by the frequent recurrence of devotional and religious books in the literary talk of the day, and, what is perhaps more remarkable, by the fact that wherever Boswell and Johnson go they constantly find volumes of sermons lying about, not only in the private houses, but also in the inns where they stay. There never was a period when &ldquo;conduct,&rdquo; as Matthew Arnold used to call it, was so admitted to be the three-fourths of life he claimed for it, as it was between the Restoration and the French Revolution. It was conduct, not faith, ethics not religion, the &ldquo;whole duty of man&rdquo; in this life, not his supernatural destiny in another, that mainly occupied the minds of serious people&nbsp; in that unecclesiastical age. And Johnson, definite Christian, definite Churchman as he was, full even of ecclesiastical prejudices, was just the man to appeal to a generation with such interests as these.</p>
<p class="p24">No questions occupied him so much as moral questions. He was all his life considering how he ought to live, and trying to live better. People who are in earnest about these things have always found not only his published prayers or his moral essays, but his life as told by Boswell full of fortifying and stimulating ethical food. All alike exhibit a mind that recognized the problem of the conduct of life as the one thing of supreme interest to a rational man, and recognized it as above all things a moral problem. His treatment of it is usually based on reason, not on mere authority or orthodoxy, or even on Christianity at all. <span class="t8">Rasselas</span>, for instance, his most popular ethical work, which was translated into most of the European languages, does not contain a single allusion to Christianity. Its atmosphere is neither Mahomedan nor Christian, but that of pure reason. And when elsewhere he does discuss definitely Christian problems it is usually in the light of free and unfettered reason. Reason by itself has probably never made any one a Christian, and certainly Johnson&rsquo;s&nbsp; Christianity was not an affair of the reason alone, but he was seldom afraid to test it by the touchstone of reason. That was not merely a thing done in accordance with the fashion of his age; it was the inevitable activity of an acute and powerful mind. But the fact that he had in him this absorbing ethical interest, and that throughout his life he was applying to it a rare intellectual energy, and what was rarer still in those fields, a close and unfailing grip on life and reality, gave him that peculiar position to which he came in his last years; one of an authority which was probably not equalled by that of any professed philosopher or divine.</p>
<p class="p24">Still, his seriousness could not by itself have given him this position. The English people like their public men to be serious, but they do not like them to be nothing else. The philosopher and the saint, the merely intellectual man or the merely spiritual man, have never been popular characters or become leaders of men, here any more than elsewhere. The essential element in the confidence Johnson inspired was not his seriousness: it was his sovereign sanity, the unfailing common sense, to which allusion has already been made. He was pre-eminently a bookish man, but he was conspicuously free from the unreality that is so often felt&nbsp; in the characters of such men. He knew from the first how to strike a note which showed that he was well aware of the difference between literature and life and their relative importance.</p>
<p class="p26">&nbsp;&rdquo;Deign on the passing world to turn thine eyes,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;And pause awhile from Letters, to be wise.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">So he said, as a young man, in his finest poem, and so he acted all through the years. Scholar as he was, and very conscious of the dignity of scholarship, he never forgot that scholarship faded into insignificance in presence of the greater issues of life. In his most scholarly moment, in the Preface to the <span class="t8">Dictionary</span>, he will throw out such remark as &ldquo;this recommendation of steadiness and uniformity (in spelling) does not proceed from an opinion that particular combinations of letters have much influence on human happiness.&rdquo; Such a sentence could not but give plain people a feeling of unusual confidence in the writer. How different they would at once feel it to be, how different, indeed, we still feel it, from the too frequent pedantry of critics, insisting with solemn importance or querulous ill-temper upon trifling points of grammar or style. We know that this man has a scale of things in his mind&nbsp; he will not vilify his opponent&rsquo;s character for the sake of a difference about a Greek construction, or make a lifelong quarrel over the question of the maiden name and birthplace of Shelley&rsquo;s great-grandmother. From first to last he was emphatically a human being, with a feeling for human life as a whole, and in all its parts. He said once: &ldquo;A mere antiquarian is a rugged being,&rdquo; and he was never himself a mere grammarian or a mere scholar, but a man with an eager interest in all the business and pleasure of life. His high sense of the dignity of literature looked to its large and human side, not to any parade of curious information. Everywhere in his writings plain people are conciliated by his frank attitude as to his own calling, by his perfect freedom from any pontifical airs of the mystery of authorship. &ldquo;I could have written longer notes,&rdquo; he says in the great Preface to his <span class="t8">Shakespeare</span>, &ldquo;for the art of writing notes is not of difficult attainment.&rdquo; &ldquo;It is impossible for an expositor not to write too little for some, and too much for others.&rdquo; &ldquo;I have indeed disappointed no opinion more than my own; yet I have endeavoured to perform my task with no slight solicitude. Not a single passage in the whole work has appeared to me corrupt which I have not attempted to restore; or&nbsp; obscure which I have not endeavoured to illustrate. In many I have failed, like others, and from many, after all my efforts, I have retreated, and confessed the repulse. I have not passed over with affected superiority what is equally difficult to the reader and to myself, but where I could not instruct him have owned my ignorance. I might easily have accumulated a mass of seeming learning upon easy scenes; but it ought not to be imputed to negligence that, where nothing was necessary, nothing has been done, or that, where others have said enough, I have said no more.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">A man who writes like this is sure of his public at once. He is instantly seen to be too proud, as well as too sincere, too great a man, in fact, altogether, to stoop to the dishonest little artifices by which vanity tries to steal applause. In his writings as in his talk, he was not afraid to be seen for what he actually was; and just as, when asked how he came to explain the word Pastern as meaning the knee of a horse, he replied at once, &ldquo;Ignorance, madam, pure ignorance,&rdquo; so in his books he made no attempt to be thought wiser or more learned than he was. And this modesty which he showed for himself he showed for his author too. The common notion that he depreciated&nbsp; Shakespeare is, indeed, an entire mistake. There were certainly things in Shakespeare which were out of his reach, but that does not alter the fact that Shakespeare has never been better praised than in Johnson&rsquo;s Preface. But he will not say what he does not mean about Shakespeare any more than about himself. There is in him nothing at all of the subtle trickery of the common critic who thinks to magnify his own importance by extravagant and insincere laudation of his author. He is not afraid to speak of the poet with the same simplicity as he speaks of the editor. &ldquo;Yet it must be at last confessed that, as we owe everything to him, he owes something to us; that, if much of his praise is paid by perception and judgment, much is likewise given by custom and veneration.&rdquo; He even adds that Shakespeare has &ldquo;perhaps not one play which, if it were now exhibited as the work of a contemporary writer, would be heard to the conclusion.&rdquo; Whether that is true or not of Johnson&rsquo;s day or of our own &mdash; and let us not be too hastily sure of its untruth &mdash; at least the man who wrote it in the preface to an edition of Shakespeare lacked neither honesty nor courage. And he had then, as he has still, the reward which the most popular of the virtues will always bring.</p>

<p class="p24">With courage and honesty usually go simplicity and directness. That is not the first praise that Johnson would win from people familiar with caricatures of his style. But it is a complete mistake to suppose that he always wore that heavy armour of magniloquence. He could be as free from pedantry of phrase as he always was from pedantry of thought. He is not only a supreme master of common sense; he is a supreme master of the language of common sense. He has the gift of saying things which no one can misunderstand and no one can forget. His common sense is what its name implies, no private possession thrust upon the minds of others, but their own thoughts expressed for them. That was one of the secrets of the unique confidence he inspired. The jury gave him their verdict because he always put the issue on a basis they could understand. His answer to the specious arguments of the learned is always an appeal to what it needs no learning to know. The critics of Pope&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Homer</span> are met by the unanswerable retort: &ldquo;To a thousand cavils one answer is sufficient. The purpose of a writer is to be read.&rdquo; To Pope himself affecting scorn of the great, the same merciless measure of common knowledge is dealt. &ldquo;His scorn of the great is too often repeated to be real: no man thinks&nbsp; much of that which he despises.&rdquo; And so once more to Pope&rsquo;s victims. If they would have kept quiet, he says, the <span class="t8">Dunciad</span> would have been little read: &ldquo;For whom did it concern to know that one or another scribbler was a dunce?&rdquo; But this is what the dunces are the last people to realize: indeed, &ldquo;every man is of importance to himself, and therefore, in his own opinion, to others&rdquo;; so the victim is the first to &ldquo;publish injuries or misfortunes which had never been known unless related by himself, and at which those that hear them will only laugh; for no man sympathizes with the sorrows of vanity.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Every one who is much read in Johnson will recall for himself other and perhaps better instances than these of his rare faculty of gathering together into a sentence some piece of the common stock of wisdom or observation, and applying it simply, directly and unanswerably to the immediate business in hand. Is there anything which clears and relieves an argument so well? &ldquo;The true state of every nation is the state of common life&rdquo;; &ldquo;If one was to think constantly of death the business of life would stand still&rdquo;; &ldquo;To be happy at home is the ultimate result of all ambition.&rdquo; How firm on one&rsquo;s feet, on the solid ground of truth, one feels when one reads such sentences! The writer of them&nbsp; is at once recognized as no maker of phrases, no victim of cloudy speculations, self-deceived and the deceiver of others, but a man who kept himself always close to the realities of things. And when to this, which had been always there, was added the special charm of the <span class="t8">Lives of the Poets</span>, the old man speaking, often in the first person, without reserve or mystery, out of the fullness of his knowledge of books and men and the general life which is greater than either, then the feeling entertained for him grew into something not very unlike affection. The man who could not be concealed even by the grave abstractions of the earlier works, was now seen and heard as a friend speaking face to face with those who understood him. The wisdom, and learning and piety, the shrewdness and vigour and wit, the invincible common sense, took visible shape in the face of Samuel Johnson, were heard in his audible voice, became known and honoured and loved as a kind of national glory, the embodiment of the mind and character of the English people. And then, of course, came Boswell. And what might have died away as a memory or a legend was made secure from mortality by a work of genius. At the moment Boswell had only to complete an impression already made. But, strong as it was at the time, without Boswell it could&nbsp; not have lasted. Those who had sat with Johnson at the Mitre or &ldquo;The Club&rdquo; could not long survive, and could not leave their eyes and ears behind them. Literary fashions changed; popular taste began to ask evermore for amusement and less for instruction or edification; and the works of Johnson were no longer read, except by students of English literature. But for Boswell the great man&rsquo;s name might soon have been unknown to any but bookish men. It is due to Boswell that journalists quote him, and cabmen tell stories about him. Johnson had himself almost every quality that makes for survival except genius; and that, by the happiest of fates for himself and for us, he found in his biographer.</p>
