<title>CHAPTER III. THE LIVES OF BOSWELL AND JOHNSON</title>
</head>
<body>
<h2 class="h20"><a id="a2466"></a>CHAPTER III. THE LIVES OF BOSWELL AND JOHNSON</h2>
<p class="p21">These two men, then, are for ever inseparable. They go down the centuries together, Johnson owing most of his immortality to the genius of Boswell, Boswell owing to Johnson that inspiring opportunity without which genius cannot discover that it is genius. There were other men in Johnson&rsquo;s circle, whom he knew longer and respected more; but for us, Boswell&rsquo;s position in relation to Johnson is unique. Beside him the others, even Burke and Reynolds, are, in this connection, shadows. They had their independent fields of greatness in which Johnson had no share: Boswell&rsquo;s greatness is all Johnsonian. We cannot think of him apart from Johnson: and he has so managed that we can scarcely think of Johnson apart from him. No one who occupies himself with the one can ignore the other: in interest and popularity they stand or fall together. It may be well, therefore, before going further, to give the bare facts of both their lives; dismissing Boswell first, as the less important, and then devoting the rest of the chapter to Johnson.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p24">James Boswell was born in 1740. He came of an ancient family, a fact he never forgot, as, indeed, few people do who have the same advantage. His father was a Scottish judge with the title of Lord Auchinleck. The first of the family to hold the estate of Auchinleck, which is in Ayrshire, was Thomas Boswell, who received a grant of it from James IV in whose army he went to Flodden and shared the defeat and death of his patron. The estate had therefore belonged to the Boswells over two hundred years when the future biographer of Johnson was born. His father and he were never congenial spirits. The judge was a Whig with a practical view of life and had no sympathy with his son&rsquo;s romantic propensities either in religion, politics or literature. A plain Lowland Scot, he did not see why his son should take up with Toryism, Anglicanism, or literary hero-worship. When James, after first attaching himself to Paoli, the leader of the Corsican struggle for independence, returned home and took up the discipleship to Johnson which was to be the central fact in the rest of his life, his father frankly despaired of him, and broke out, according to Walter Scott: &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nae hope for Jamie, mon. Jamie is gaen clean gyte. What do you think, mon? He&rsquo;s done wi&rsquo; Paoli &mdash; he&rsquo;s off wi&rsquo; the&nbsp; landlouping scoundrel of a Corsican; and whose tail do you think he has pinned himself to now, mon? A <span class="t8">dominie</span>, mon &mdash; an auld dominie: he keeped a schule, and cau&rsquo;d it an acaadamy.&rdquo; Well might Boswell say that they were &ldquo;so totally different that a good understanding is scarcely possible.&rdquo; Beside disliking Paoli and Johnson, Lord Auchinleck cared nothing for some of Boswell&rsquo;s strict feudal notions, had the bad taste to give his son a step-mother, and to be as unlike him as possible in the matter of good spirits. Scarcely anything could interfere with the judge&rsquo;s cheerfulness, while Boswell was always falling into depressions about nothing in particular and perhaps indulging in the &ldquo;foolish notion,&rdquo; rebuked by Johnson, that &ldquo;melancholy is a proof of acuteness.&rdquo; But in spite of their differences the father and son managed to avoid anything like a definite breach. Boswell was sincerely anxious to please his father, and was constantly urged in that direction by his great mentor: and after all the judge went some way to meet his singular son, for he paid his debts and entertained both Paoli and Johnson at Auchinleck. The latter visit was naturally a source of some anxiety to Boswell and it did not go off without a storm when the old Whig and the old Tory unluckily got on to the topic of Charles I and Cromwell: but all&nbsp; ended well, and Boswell characteristically ends his story of it, written after both were dead, with the pious hope that the antagonists had by then met in a higher state of existence &ldquo;where there is no room for Whiggism.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Full of activities as Boswell&rsquo;s life was, the definite facts and dates in it are not very numerous. He was sent to Glasgow University, and wished to be a soldier, but was bred by his father to the law. No doubt he gave some early signs of intellectual promise, for which it was not thought the army provided a fit sphere, for the Duke of Argyle is reported to have said to his father when he was only twenty: &ldquo;My lord, I like your son: this boy must not be shot at for three-and-sixpence a day.&rdquo; He paid his first visit to London in 1760; and, having heard a good deal about Johnson from one Mr. Gentleman, and from Derrick, a very minor poet, he at once sought an introduction, but had to leave London without succeeding in his object. He was equally unsuccessful when he was in London the next year, during which he published some anonymous poems which would not have helped him to secure the desired introduction. The great event occurred at last in 1763. The day was the 16th of May and the scene the house of Davies, the bookseller. &ldquo;At last,&rdquo; says Boswell, &ldquo;on&nbsp; Monday the 16th of May, when I was sitting in Mr. Davies&rsquo;s back-parlour, after having drunk tea with him and Mrs. Davies, Johnson unexpectedly came into the shop; and Mr. Davies having perceived him through the glass-door in the room in which we were sitting, advancing towards us, &mdash; he announced his aweful approach to me, somewhat in the manner of an actor in the part of Horatio, when he addresses Hamlet on the appearance of his father&rsquo;s ghost, &lsquo;Look, my Lord, it comes.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">So, with characteristic accuracy and characteristic imagination, begins his well-known account of his first meeting with his hero, and the storms to which he was exposed in its course. But all ended satisfactorily, for when the great man was gone, Davies reassured the nervous Boswell by saying: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be uneasy, I can see he likes you very well.&rdquo; A few days afterwards Boswell called on Johnson at his Chambers in the Temple, and the great friendship which was the pleasure and business of his life was definitely begun. Yet it is worth remembering, if only as an additional proof of Boswell&rsquo;s biographical genius, that, according to the calculation of Dr. Birkbeck Hill, when all the weeks and months during which Johnson and Boswell were living within reach of each&nbsp; other are added together, they amount to little more than two years. And of course this includes all the days on which they were both in London, on many, or rather most, of which they did not meet.</p>
<p class="p24">A few months after the first meeting, Boswell went by his father&rsquo;s wish to Utrecht to study law. But before that the friendship was got on to a firm footing, and Boswell had had the pride and pleasure of hearing Johnson say, &ldquo;There are few people whom I take so much to, as you.&rdquo; A still stronger proof of Johnson&rsquo;s feeling was that he insisted on going with Boswell to Harwich to see him out of England. This was the occasion on which he scarified the good Protestants who were with them in the coach by defending the Inquisition, and invited one of the ladies who said she never allowed her children to be idle to take his own education in hand; &ldquo;&lsquo;for I have been an idle fellow all my life.&rsquo; &lsquo;I am sure, sir,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;you have not been idle.&rsquo; &lsquo;Nay, madam, it is very true, and that gentleman there,&rsquo; pointing to me, &lsquo;has been idle. He was idle at Edinburgh. His father sent him to Glasgow where he continued to be idle. He then came to London where he has been very idle; and now he is going to Utrecht where he will be as idle as ever.&rsquo; I asked him privately how he could expose me&nbsp; so. &lsquo;Pooh, Pooh!&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;they know nothing about you and will think of it no more.&rsquo;&rdquo; When he was not engaged in these alarums and excursions or in reproving Boswell for giving the coachman a shilling instead of the customary sixpence, he was occupied in reading Pomponius Mela <span class="t8">De Situ Orbis</span>. How complete the picture is and how vivid! It once more gives Boswell&rsquo;s method in miniature.</p>
<p class="p24">He seems to have stayed at Utrecht about a year, afterwards travelling in Germany, where he visited Wittenberg, and sat down to write to Johnson in the church where the Reformation was first preached, with his paper resting on the tomb of Melanchthon. It is noticeable that, though he had only known Johnson a year, he already hoped to be his biographer. &ldquo;At this tomb, then, my ever dear and respected friend, I vow to thee an eternal attachment. It shall be my study to do what I can to render your life happy: and, if you die before me, I shall endeavour to do honour to your memory.&rdquo; He was also at this time in Italy and Switzerland, where he visited Voltaire and gratified him by quoting a remark of Johnson&rsquo;s that Frederick the Great&rsquo;s writings were the sort of stuff one might expect from &ldquo;a footboy who had been Voltaire&rsquo;s amanuensis.&rdquo; Nor did this&nbsp; collector of celebrities omit to visit Rousseau, the rival lion of the day, between whom and Voltaire the orthodox Johnson thought it was &ldquo;difficult to settle the proportion of iniquity.&rdquo; But as far as Boswell&rsquo;s records go, he never said such violent things of Voltaire as of Rousseau, whom he called &ldquo;a rascal who ought to be hunted out of society and transported to work in the plantations.&rdquo; Boswell, however, was an admirer of the <span class="t8">Vicaire Savoyard</span>, and said what he could in defence of his host, in return for the hospitality he had enjoyed at Neuchatel, with the usual result, of course, that Johnson only became more outrageous.</p>
<p class="p24">In 1765 Boswell made the acquaintance of another distinguished man with whom his name will always be connected. Corsica had at that time been long, and on the whole victoriously, engaged in a struggle to free itself from the hated rule of Genoa. The leader of the Corsicans was a man of high birth, character and abilities, Pascal Paoli, who had acted since 1753 at once as their General and as the head of the civil administration. Both the generous and the curious element in Boswell made him anxious not to return from Italy without seeing something of so interesting a people and so great a hero. Armed with introductions from Rousseau&nbsp; and others and with such protection as a British Captain&rsquo;s letter could give him against Barbary Corsairs, he sailed from Leghorn to Corsica in September 1765. His account of the island and of his tour there, published in 1768, is still very good reading. He soon made his way to the palace where Paoli was residing, with whom he at first felt himself in a presence more awe-inspiring than that of princes, but ventured after a while upon a compliment to the Corsicans. &ldquo;Sir, I am upon my travels, and have lately visited Rome. I am come from seeing the ruins of one brave and free people: I now see the rise of another.&rdquo; The good sense of Paoli declined any parallel between Rome and his own little people, but he soon received Boswell into his intimacy and spent some hours alone with him almost every day. One fine answer of his, uniting the scholar and the patriot, is worth quoting. Boswell asked him how he, who confessed to his love of society and particularly of the society of learned and cultivated men, could be content to pass his life in an island where no such advantages were to be had; to which Paoli replied at once &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&ldquo;Vincit amor patriae laudumque immensa cupido.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p24">Well might Boswell wish to have a statue of him taken at that moment. Even Virgilian quotation has seldom been put to nobler use. Like all the great men of the eighteenth century, Paoli was an enthusiast for the ancients. &ldquo;A young man who would form his mind to glory,&rdquo; he told Boswell, &ldquo;must not read modern memoirs; <span class="t8">ma Plutarcho, ma Tito Livio</span>.&rdquo; His own mind was formed not only to glory, but also to what so often fails to go with glory, to justice and moderation. Nothing is more remarkable in the conversations with him recorded by Boswell than his good sense and fairness of mind in speaking of the Genoese. Even in the excitement of Corsica, Boswell did not forget Johnson. He says that he quoted specimens of Johnson&rsquo;s wisdom to Paoli, who &ldquo;translated them to the Corsican heroes with Italian energy&rdquo;; and, as he had written to his master &ldquo;from the tomb of Melanchthon sacred to learning and piety,&rdquo; so he also wrote to him &ldquo;from the palace of Pascal Paoli sacred to wisdom and liberty.&rdquo; Boswell was received with great honour in Corsica, no doubt partly because he was very naturally supposed to have some mission from the British Government. He left the island in December and arrived in London in February 1766, when his intimacy with Johnson was at once resumed, in spite&nbsp; of the visits to Rousseau and Voltaire which drew some inevitable sarcasms from the great man. He soon, however, returned to Scotland, where he was admitted an Advocate in the summer of 1766.</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson thought he was too busy about Corsica, and wrote to him: &ldquo;Empty your head of Corsica, which I think has filled it rather too long.&rdquo; But this was in March 1768, when Boswell&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Account of Corsica</span> had already been published. It sold very well, a second and a third edition appearing within the year. Gray and other good judges spoke warmly of it and it seems that a French translation as well as two Dutch ones were made. It caused so much stir and aroused so much sympathy in England that Lord Holland was quite afraid we were going to be &ldquo;so foolish as to go to war because Mr. Boswell has been in Corsica.&rdquo; After this it was less likely than ever that Boswell would forget that island. Motives of vanity combined with his genuine enthusiasm to keep him full of it, and he replied to Johnson&rsquo;s monition: &ldquo;Empty my head of Corsica! empty it of honour, empty it of humanity, empty it of friendship, empty it of piety! No! while I live, Corsica and the cause of the brave islanders shall ever employ much of my attention and interest me in the sincerest&nbsp; manner.&rdquo; It seems from his letters to Temple that he found these outbursts a great deal easier than living in a manner worthy of a friend of Paoli. But he did more than talk. He wrote to Chatham to try to interest him in Corsica, and received a reply three pages long applauding his generous warmth; he brought out a volume of <span class="t8">British Essays in Favour of the Brave Corsicans</span>, sent Paoli Johnson&rsquo;s Works and, what was more substantial, forwarded a quantity of ordnance, to buy which he had managed to raise a subscription of 700 pounds. His desire to be a well-known man now began to receive some gratification and he frankly confesses his pleasure at having such men as Johnson, Hume and Franklin dining with him at his chambers. Nor will any reasonable man blame him. His snobbishness, if it is to be so called, was always primarily a snobbishness of mind and character, not of wealth or rank.</p>
<p class="p24">Nothing else of importance occurred to him in these years. He was much occupied with the great law-suit about the succession to the Douglas property, on which he wrote two pamphlets and was so sure of the justice of his view that he once dared to tell Johnson he knew nothing about that subject. He was with Johnson at Oxford in 1768 and they were already talking of going to the Hebrides&nbsp; together. The next year, 1769, saw the conquest of Corsica by the French to whom the Genoese had ceded their claims. The result was that Paoli came to London, where he lived till 1789, and Boswell was constantly with him. In this year he did at least one very foolish thing, and at least one very wise one. He made himself ridiculous by going to the Shakespeare Jubilee at Stratford and appearing in Corsican costume with &ldquo;<span class="t8">Viva la Libertà</span>&rdquo; embroidered on his cap. He also took the most sensible step of his whole life in marrying his cousin, Margaret Montgomerie, on November 25. She never liked Johnson, and her husband had the candour to report an excellent sally of hers at his and his sage&rsquo;s expense: &ldquo;I have seen many a bear led by a man; but I never before saw a man led by a bear.&rdquo; But though, as Boswell says, she could not be expected to like his &ldquo;irregular hours and uncouth habits,&rdquo; she never failed in courtesy to him: and he on his part was unwearied in sending friendly messages to his &ldquo;dear enemy&rdquo; as he called her, and was well aware of her importance to her husband. The event unhappily proved his prescience; for after her death in 1789, Boswell&rsquo;s downward course was visibly accelerated.</p>
<p class="p24">After Boswell&rsquo;s marriage there was no&nbsp; communication between him and Johnson for a year and a half, and they did not meet again till March 1772, when Boswell came to London, and stayed some time. The next year he came again, and, by Johnson&rsquo;s active support, was elected a member of &ldquo;The Club,&rdquo; a small society of friends founded by Reynolds and Johnson in 1764. At first it met weekly for supper, but after a few years the members began the custom of dining together on fixed dates which has continued to the present day. Among the members when Boswell was elected were Johnson and Reynolds, Burke, Goldsmith and Garrick. Gibbon and Charles Fox came in the next year, and Adam Smith in 1775. In 1780 the number of members was enlarged to forty which is still the limit. &ldquo;The Club&rdquo; has always maintained its distinction, and a recent article in the <span class="t8">Edinburgh Review</span> records that fifteen Prime Ministers have been members of it, as well as men like Scott, Tennyson, Hallam, Macaulay and Grote. The first advantage over and above pride and pleasure derived by Boswell from his election was the acquaintance of Burke, which he had long desired and retained through life. Burke said of him that he had so much good humour naturally that it was scarcely a virtue in him.</p>
<p class="p24">In the autumn of that year, 1773, Johnson&nbsp; and Boswell made their famous tour to the Hebrides. They, in fact, went over much more than the Hebrides, seeing the four Universities of Edinburgh, St. Andrews, Aberdeen and Glasgow, besides many less famous places. Johnson says they were everywhere &ldquo;received like princes in their progress,&rdquo; and though no doubt hospitality was freer in those days when travellers were few and inns poor, yet the whole story is a remarkable proof of Johnson&rsquo;s fame and Boswell&rsquo;s popularity. The University Professors vied with each other in paying civilities to Johnson, the town of Aberdeen gave him its freedom, and among their hosts were magnates like the Duke of Argyll, Lord Errol and Lord Loudoun, who &ldquo;jumped for joy&rdquo; at their coming, and great men of law or learning like Lord Monboddo and Lord Elibank.</p>
<p class="p24">By this time all the important events in Boswell&rsquo;s life were over except the publication of his two great books, the <span class="t8">Tour to the Hebrides</span> and the <span class="t8">Life of Johnson</span>. During all the ten years which Johnson still had to live, except 1780 and 1782, the two friends managed to spend some time together, and when they did not, the friendship was maintained by correspondence. Boswell&rsquo;s father died in 1782, and Boswell came into possession of the estate,&nbsp; worth 1,600 pounds a year. Johnson and Boswell took more than one &ldquo;jaunt&rdquo; in the country together, visiting Oxford, Lichfield and other places. They were at Oxford together in June 1784; but Johnson was then evidently failing. On their return to London, Boswell busied himself with the help of Reynolds in trying to get Johnson&rsquo;s pension increased, so that he might be able to spend the winter abroad. Johnson was very pleased on hearing of the attempt, saying, when Boswell told him, &ldquo;&lsquo;This is taking prodigious pains about a man.&rsquo; &lsquo;O, sir,&rsquo; said Boswell, &lsquo;your friends would do everything for you.&rsquo; He paused, grew more and more agitated, till tears started into his eyes, and he exclaimed with fervent emotion, &lsquo;God bless you all.&rsquo; I was so affected that I also shed tears. After a short silence he renewed and extended his grateful benediction, &lsquo;God bless you all, for Jesus Christ&rsquo;s sake.&rsquo;&rdquo; Those were the last words Boswell heard under Johnson&rsquo;s roof. The next day they both dined with Reynolds, and on July 2 Boswell left London, to see Johnson no more. Johnson died on the 13th of December 1784.</p>
<p class="p24">Fitful and unsuccessful legal and political ambitions occupied a large part of Boswell&rsquo;s later years. He made some approaches to standing as a candidate for Ayrshire in 1784,&nbsp; and again in 1788, was called to the English Bar in 1786, attached himself to Lord Lonsdale, and hoped to enter Parliament for one of his boroughs, but seems to have got nothing out of his connection with that insolent old bully but a certain amount of humiliation and the Recordership of Carlisle. That unimportant office was the only substantial reward he received from all his long suit and service in the antechambers of law and politics. Whatever he achieved he owed to literature and the friends his love of literature had brought him. It was not the laird or the lawyer, but the friend and biographer of Johnson whom the Royal Academy appointed in 1791 to the complimentary office of their Secretary for Foreign Correspondence. And those last years, while they brought him disappointment in everything else, saw him take definite rank as a successful author. The <span class="t8">Tour to the Hebrides</span> was published in 1785, and sold out in a few weeks. The third edition was issued within a year of the appearance of the first. It was followed by the publication of Johnson&rsquo;s famous Letter to Lord Chesterfield and of an account of his Conversation with George III, and finally in 1791 by the <span class="t8">Life</span> itself. A second edition of this was called for in 1793. Boswell only lived two years more. He died on May 19, 1795. He left two sons, Alexander,&nbsp; who became Sir Alexander, was the principal mover in the matter of the Burns Monument on the banks of Doon, and was killed in a duel in 1822; and James, who supplied notes for the third edition of his father&rsquo;s great book, and edited the third <span class="t8">Variorum Shakespeare</span>, known as Boswell&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Malone</span>, in 1821.</p>
<p class="p24">Such were the main outlines of the life of the biographer. We may now turn to those of the life which he owes his fame to recording. They are in most ways very unlike his own. Samuel Johnson was very far from being heir to a large estate and an ancient name. He was the son of a bookseller at Lichfield, and was born there on the 18th of September 1709, in a house which is now preserved in public hands in memory of the event of that day. His father&rsquo;s family was so obscure that he once said, &ldquo;I can hardly tell who was my grandfather.&rdquo; His mother was Sarah Ford, who came of a good yeoman stock in Warwickshire. She was both a good and an intelligent woman. Samuel was the elder and only ultimately surviving issue of the marriage. A picturesque incident in his childhood is that his mother took him to London to be &ldquo;touched&rdquo; by Queen Anne for the scrofula, or &ldquo;king&rsquo;s evil,&rdquo; as it was called, from which he suffered. He must have been one of the last persons to go through this curious&nbsp; ceremony, which the Georges never performed, though the service for it remained in the Book of Common Prayer for some years after the accession of George I. The boy made an impression upon people from the first. He liked to recall in later life that the dame who first taught him to read brought him a present of gingerbread when he was starting for Oxford, and told him he was the best scholar she had ever had. Afterwards he went to Lichfield School, and at the age of fifteen to Stourbridge. At both he was evidently held in respect by boys and masters alike. Probably the curious combination in him of the invalid and the prize-fighter which was conspicuous all through his life, already arrested attention in his boyhood. He played none of the ordinary games, but yet, as we have already seen, was acknowledged as a leader by the boys, and his abilities were the pride of the school. He already exhibited the amazing memory which enabled him in later life to dictate to Boswell his famous letter to Chesterfield rather than search for a copy, and to confute a person who praised a bad translation from Martial by a contemptuous &ldquo;Why, sir, the original is thus,&rdquo; followed by a recitation not only of the Latin original which it is not likely he had looked at for years, but also of the translation which he had only read&nbsp; once. So on another occasion when Baretti, who had read a little Ariosto with him some years before, proposed to give him some more lessons, but feared he might have forgotten their previous readings, &ldquo;Who forgets, sir?&rdquo; said Johnson, and immediately repeated three or four stanzas of the <span class="t8">Orlando</span>. To the lover of literature there is no possession more precious than a good verbal memory, and this Johnson enjoyed to a very unusual degree all through his life. But it is worth noting that he was entirely free from the defect which commonly results from an exceptional memory. He always thought and spoke for himself, and was never prevented from using his own mind and his own words by the fact that his memory supplied him abundantly with those of others. His scholarly friend Langton annoyed him by depending upon books too much in his conversation, and one of his compliments to Boswell was, &ldquo;You and I do not talk from books.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">After he left Stourbridge he spent two years at home in desultory reading, &ldquo;not voyages and travels, but all literature, sir, all ancient writers, all manly; though but little Greek, only some of Anacreon and Hesiod,&rdquo; the result of which was that when he went up to Oxford, the Master of his College said he was &ldquo;the best qualified for the University that&nbsp; he had ever known come there.&rdquo; His College was Pembroke, of which he became a Commoner (not a Servitor, as Carlyle said) in 1728. The Oxford of that day was not a place of much discipline and the official order of study was very laxly maintained. It seems not to have meant much to Johnson, and he is described as having spent a good deal of his time &ldquo;lounging at the College gates with a circle of young students round him, whom he was entertaining with wit and keeping from their studies.&rdquo; Most good talkers find the first real sphere for their talent when they get to the University, and the best of all was not likely to be an exception, nor to resist that strongest of the intellectual temptations. But he did some solid reading, especially Greek, though he seemed to himself to be very idle, perhaps because his standard was so high that he used to say in later life, &ldquo;I never knew a man who studied hard.&rdquo; So when he confesses the imperfections of his Greek scholarship, and other people exaggerate his confession, it is well to remember the reply made by Jacob Bryant when Gifford in an argument quoted Johnson&rsquo;s admission that &ldquo;he was not a good Greek scholar,&rdquo; &ldquo;Sir, it is not easy for us to say what such a man as Johnson would call a good Greek scholar.&rdquo; A man whose remedy for&nbsp; sleeplessness was to turn Greek epigrams into Latin was at any rate not ignorant of Greek.</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson was prevented by his poverty from getting the full advantages either out of the life or the studies of Oxford. His want of shoes prevented his attending lectures, his pride forbad him to receive doles of help, the friend, said to be a Mr. Corbet of Shropshire, on whose promises of support he had relied in going to Oxford, failed him, his father&rsquo;s business went from little to less; with the inevitable result that he had to leave Oxford without a degree. This was in December 1729. But he had made an impression there, had a strong affection for his College, and liked going to stay there in the days of his glory. His usual host was one Dr. Adams, the Master of Pembroke, who had once been his tutor but told Boswell that the relation was only nominal; &ldquo;he was above my mark.&rdquo; When he left Oxford he returned to his Lichfield home, where his father died two months later, leaving so little behind him that all that Johnson received of his estate was twenty pounds. He seems to have remained at Lichfield, where the poverty of his family did not prevent his mixing with the most cultivated society of a town rich in cultivated people, till 1732, when he became an usher in a school at Market Bosworth. He hated this monotonous drudgery&nbsp; and left it after a few months, going to live with a Mr. Warren, a Birmingham bookseller of good repute, whom he helped by his knowledge of literature. While in Birmingham he did a translation of a Jesuit book about Abyssinia, for which Warren paid him five guineas. In 1734 he returned to Lichfield, tried without success to obtain subscribers for an edition of the poems of Politian, and offered to write in the <span class="t8">Gentleman&rsquo;s Magazine</span>. It is difficult to see how he supported himself at this period: perhaps he was helped by his mother or by his brother who carried on the bookselling business till his death a little later. Anyhow it was just at this time that he took a step for which poverty generally finds the courage more quickly than wealth. He married Elizabeth Porter at St. Werburgh&rsquo;s Church, Derby, in July 1735. Mrs. Porter was a widow twice his age and not of an attractive appearance; but there is no doubt that Johnson&rsquo;s love for her was sincere and lasting. To the end of his life he remembered her frequently in his prayers &ldquo;if it were lawful,&rdquo; and kept the anniversary of her death with prayers and tears. Eighteen years after she died he could write in his private note-books that his grief for her was not abated and that he had less pleasure in any good that happened to him, because she could not share&nbsp; it: and in 1782 when she had been dead thirty years, and he was drawing near his own end, he prays for her and after doing so, noted &ldquo;perhaps Tetty knows that I prayed for her. Perhaps Tetty is now praying for me. God help me.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">This was the inner truth of the relation between Johnson and his elderly wife, but it was natural and indeed inevitable that the world, the little world of their acquaintances, should have been chiefly alive to the humorous external aspect of the marriage, and one does not wonder that Beauclerk, whose married life was a scandal following on a divorce, should have enjoyed relating that Johnson had said to him, &ldquo;Sir, it was a love marriage on both sides!&rdquo; Johnson&rsquo;s own account of the actual wedding is singular enough. &ldquo;Sir, she had read the old romances, and had got into her head the fantastical notion that a woman of spirit should use her lover like a dog. So, sir, at first she told me that I rode too fast, and she could not keep up with me; and, when I rode a little slower, she passed me, and complained that I lagged behind. I was not to be made the slave of caprice; and I resolved to begin as I meant to end. I therefore pushed on briskly, till I was fairly out of her sight. The road lay between two hedges, so I was sure she could not miss it; and I contrived that she should&nbsp; soon come up with me. When she did, I observed her to be in tears.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Mrs. Johnson was the widow of a Birmingham draper, and brought her husband several hundred pounds, part of which was at once spent in hiring and furnishing a large house at Edial near Lichfield where Johnson proposed to take pupils. But no pupils came except David Garrick and his brother, the sons of an old Lichfield friend, and the &ldquo;academy&rdquo; was abandoned after a year and a half. The lack of pupils, however, was perhaps a blessing in disguise, for it enabled Johnson to write most of his tragedy <span class="t8">Irene</span>, with which he went to London in March 1737. His pupil, David Garrick, went with him to study law, and when Garrick was a rich, famous and rather vain man, Johnson, who liked to curb the &ldquo;insolence of wealth&rdquo; once referred to 1737 as the year &ldquo;when I came to London with twopence half-penny in my pocket; and thou, Davy, with three-halfpence in thine.&rdquo; Nothing came of this first visit to the capital. He lived as best he could, dining for eightpence, and seeing a few friends, one of whom was Henry Hervey, son of the Earl of Bristol, of whose kindness he always retained an affectionate memory, so that he once said to Boswell, &ldquo;If you call a dog Hervey, I shall love him.&rdquo; In the summer he returned to Lichfield, and finished his&nbsp; tragedy, after which he brought his wife back with him to London which was his home for the rest of his life. Efforts to get <span class="t8">Irene</span> performed were unsuccessful, but he soon began to write regularly for the <span class="t8">Gentleman&rsquo;s Magazine</span>, of which he held so high an opinion that he looked &ldquo;with reverence&rdquo; on the house where it was printed. To this he contributed essays and was soon employed to write the <span class="t8">Parliamentary Debates</span> which, in the days before reporters, were made up with fictitious names from such scanty notes as could be got of the actual speeches. There is a story of his being, many years later, in a company who were praising a famous oration of Chatham, and were naturally a good deal startled by his quietly saying, &ldquo;That speech I wrote in a garret in Exeter Street.&rdquo; He continued to do this work till 1743 when he became aware that the speeches were taken as authentic and refused to be &ldquo;accessory to the propagation of falsehood.&rdquo; But, while engaged in it, he had had no scruples about taking care &ldquo;that the Whig dogs should not have the best of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">A much more important matter than this hack-work was the publication of his <span class="t8">London</span>, a poem in imitation of the Third Satire of Juvenal. This appeared in May 1738. He got ten guineas for it, which he was in no position to despise; but he also got something&nbsp; much more important, an established name in the world of letters. Every one talked of him, and Pope, who published his &ldquo;1738&rdquo; in the same year, was not only generous enough to inquire about him, and to say when told that the author of <span class="t8">London</span> was some obscure man, &ldquo;He will soon be <span class="t8">déterré</span>,&rdquo; but also to try to get him an Irish degree of M.A. This was in view of some attempts Johnson made to escape from dependence on journalism for his daily bread: but they were all unsuccessful, and till he received his pension his only source of income was what his various writings produced. In such circumstances he naturally wrote many things of quite ephemeral interest which call for no mention now. Perhaps the only prose work of permanent value he produced in these years was the life of his mysterious friend, Richard Savage. This curious volume appeared in 1744. The subject of it died in 1743. He and Johnson had been companions both in extreme poverty and in the intellectual pleasures which in such men poverty is unable to annihilate. Mrs. Johnson seems to have been out of London at this time, and the two struggling men of letters often passed nights together, walking and talking in the streets and squares without the price of a night&rsquo;s lodging between them. Johnson&rsquo;s account of&nbsp; his friend did not fill his pocket, but must have contributed something to his fame as it was very favourably criticized. It was the occasion of Reynolds first becoming acquainted with his name. He was so interested by the book that, having taken it up while standing with his arm leaning upon a chimney-piece, he read the whole without sitting down and found his arm quite benumbed when he got to the end.</p>
<p class="p24">&ldquo;Slow rises worth by poverty depressed.&rdquo; Johnson had now been seven years in London, but had not yet found the way to do anything worthy of his powers. If he had died then, only the curious and the learned would have known his name to-day. A single satire in verse would never, by itself, have had the force to push its way through the ever-increasing crowd of applicants that besiege the attention of posterity. But the next year, 1745, is the literary turning-point of his life. Before it was over he had begun to deal with two subjects with which much of his remaining life was occupied, and on which much of his fame depends. He had published a pamphlet upon Shakespeare&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Macbeth</span> which won the praise of Warburton, for which Johnson always felt and showed his gratitude (&ldquo;He praised me at a time when praise was of value to me&rdquo;); and, if Boswell is right, he had begun to occupy&nbsp; himself with the idea of making an English Dictionary. Thus, poor and obscure as he was in those years, sick with deferred hope as he must have been, he had in fact laid the foundation-stones of the authority and fame he was soon to enjoy as the Editor of Shakespeare and above all as &ldquo;Dictionary Johnson.&rdquo; Now at last he began to do work worthier of his powers. The &ldquo;<span class="t8">Plan for a Dictionary of the English Language</span>&rdquo; was published in 1747 and in the same year he wrote the admirable <span class="t8">Prologue</span> for the opening of Drury Lane Theatre, of which his pupil, David Garrick, more fortunate than the master with whom he had come to London, was now become manager.</p>
<p class="p24">Two years later Garrick produced the long-delayed tragedy of <span class="t8">Irene</span>. It is not a great drama, as Johnson well knew, at least in his later years. There is a story of his being told that a certain Mr. Pot called it &ldquo;the finest tragedy of modern times,&rdquo; to which his only reply was, &ldquo;If Pot says so, Pot lies.&rdquo; But this hardly has the genuine ring about it. Even Garrick&rsquo;s talent and friendship could not make <span class="t8">Irene</span> a success, but the performance brought Johnson a little welcome profit and enabled him to sell the book to Dodsley for a hundred pounds. In the same year, 1749, a more lasting evidence of his poetic powers was given&nbsp; by the appearance of <span class="t8">The Vanity of Human Wishes</span>, another Juvenalian imitation, but freer and bolder than the first. From 1750 to 1752 he was writing <span class="t8">The Rambler</span>, a sort of newspaper essay which appeared every Tuesday and Friday. He wrote it almost entirely himself, and almost always at the last moment, when the printer was calling for it. No one will now wonder that it never had a large circulation as a periodical, for it usually exhibits him at his gravest, and many of the essays are scarcely distinguishable from sermons. But that age had grave tastes and few temptations to intellectual frivolity. We have seen that the idlest sort of reading Johnson could think of for a boy was &ldquo;voyages and travels&rdquo;; novels he does not mention, indeed there were then very few of them; plays he rather strangely ignores: newspapers, as we now know them and suffer by them, he of course could not so much as conceive. <span class="t8">The Rambler</span> had no sixpenny magazines of triviality, no sensational halfpenny papers, to compete with it, and it pursued an even course of modest success for its two years of life. The greatest pleasure it brought Johnson was the praise of his wife, who said to him, &ldquo;I thought very well of you before; but I did not imagine you could have written anything equal to this.&rdquo; That was just the discovery a good&nbsp; many people beside his wife were making about Johnson in those years: with the result that when <span class="t8">The Rambler</span> appeared as a book, it sold well and had gone through twelve editions by the time Boswell wrote its author&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p class="p24">Three years after the cessation of <span class="t8">The Rambler</span> and, unhappily, also three years after the death of his wife, with whom it would have been his chief happiness to share his success, the great Dictionary appeared. It may safely be said that no single Englishman has ever accomplished a literary task of such vast extent. The mere labour, one might say the mere dull drudgery, of collecting and arranging the materials of such a work is enormous. Nor could any literary labour bring with it greater temptations. Johnson&rsquo;s success is not more due to his learning and powers of mind than to the good sense which never failed him and the strong will which he could generally exert when he chose. He pleased himself at first, as he tells us in his Preface, &ldquo;with a prospect of the hours which I should revel away in feasts of literature&rdquo;; but that, of course, was where the danger lay. A man of an equally strong love of literature and a weaker will would have allowed himself to be swept away by the indulgence of curiosity, and the luxury of desultory reading; but Johnson soon saw&nbsp; that these visions of intellectual pleasure were &ldquo;the dreams of a poet doomed at last to wake a lexicographer&rdquo;; and that, if he was to do the thing he had undertaken to do, he must set stern limits, not only to the pleasures of study, but also to the delusive quest of unattainable perfection, which is the constant parent of futility. He realized, as so many men of letters have failed to realize, that &ldquo;to deliberate whenever I doubted, to inquire whenever I was ignorant, would have protracted the undertaking without end and perhaps without much improvement&rdquo;; and instead of attempting the impossible and achieving nothing, he was wise enough and modest enough, by attempting only the attainable, to place himself in a position to achieve all that he attempted.</p>
<p class="p24">The praise he deserved was somewhat slow in coming, as is commonly the case with the greatest literary achievements. But though, as he sadly says in the last words of his great Preface, most of those whom he wished to please had sunk into the grave, and he had therefore little to hope or fear from praise or censure, yet he was always and before all things a human being, and only a creature above or below humanity could have been insensible to the pleasure of the new fame, the new authority and the new friends which his&nbsp; Dictionary gradually brought him. Before many years had passed the &ldquo;harmless drudge,&rdquo; as he himself had defined a lexicographer, had become the acknowledged law-giver and dictator of English letters; he had gathered round him a society of the finest minds of that generation, he had received a public pension which secured his independence, he had begun the long friendship which gave him a second home for more than fifteen years. These things did not all come at once &mdash; he did not know the Thrales till 1764 or 1765 &mdash; but the true turning-point in his career is the publication of his Dictionary. He was still poor for some years after that, and still much occupied in the production of hack-work: but he was never again obscure and was soon to be famous. Within a year after the appearance of the Dictionary he had issued his <span class="t8">Proposals for an Edition of Shakespeare</span>, the second in time and perhaps in importance of his three great works. His new position secured him a good number of subscribers and he intended to publish it the next year, 1757; but the interruptions of indolence, business and pleasure, as he himself says of Pope, usually disappoint the sanguine expectations of authors, and the book did not in fact appear till 1765.</p>
<p class="p24">Neither Shakespeare nor idleness had&nbsp; occupied the whole of the intervening years. From 1758 to 1760 he produced a weekly paper called <span class="t8">The Idler</span>, of the same character as <span class="t8">The Rambler</span>. In 1759 he wrote his once famous story <span class="t8">Rasselas</span> to pay the expenses of his mother&rsquo;s funeral. It was written in the evenings of a single week. Good judges thought that, if he had known how to make a bargain, he ought to have received as much as four hundred pounds for this book, which was translated into most of the European languages; but he did not in fact receive more than a hundred pounds for the first and twenty-five for the second edition. By this time he could visit Oxford, from which University he had received the degree of M.A. when his Dictionary was on the eve of publication: and another sign of the position he was beginning to occupy is that we find Smollet writing of him in 1759 as the &ldquo;great Cham of literature.&rdquo; More substantial evidences followed in 1762 when George III was advised by Bute to grant him a pension of 300 pounds a year, an income which must have seemed boundless affluence to a man who had never known a time when five pounds was not an important sum to him.</p>
<p class="p24">Next year came the event which was even more important to his fame than the receipt of the pension was to his comfort. In 1763&nbsp; he met Boswell for the first time. Fortune now began to smile upon him in good earnest and evidences of his established position and prosperity follow each other in rapid succession. &ldquo;The Club&rdquo; (its proper and still existing name, though Boswell occasionally calls it The Literary Club) was founded in 1764 and provided him for the rest of his life with an ideal theatre for the display of his amazing powers of talk, though it appears that he was not in his later years a very regular attendant. The next year, 1765, was probably the year in which he first met Thrale, the great brewer, and his clever and ambitious wife. No event contributed so much to the happiness of his after years. Thrale was a man of character and understanding, and was not without scholarly tastes. He at once saw the value of such a friend as Johnson, lived in the closest intimacy with him for the rest of his days, and named him executor in his will, which gave Johnson an opportunity such as he always liked, of mixing in business, and incidentally also, of saying the best thing that ever was said at the sale of a brewery. He appeared at the auction, according to the story told by Lord Lucan, &ldquo;bustling about with an inkhorn and pen in his button-hole, like an excise-man; and, on being asked what he really considered to be the value of the&nbsp; property, answered, &lsquo;We are not here to sell a parcel of boilers and vats, but the potentiality of growing rich beyond the dreams of avarice.&rsquo;&rdquo; The brewery was sold for 135,000 pounds to Mr. Barclay, the founder of the present firm of Barclay &amp; Perkins, who now put Johnson&rsquo;s head on the labels of their beer bottles. But it was not so much on the silent and busy Thrale himself as on his wife, a quick and clever woman fond of literary society, that the visible burden, honour and pleasure of the long friendship with Johnson fell. Till the breach caused by her second marriage just before he died no one had so much of his society as Mrs. Thrale. She soon became &ldquo;my mistress&rdquo; to him, an adaptation of his from the &ldquo;my master&rdquo; which was her phrase for her husband. And for him, too, Thrale was &ldquo;my master.&rdquo; A somewhat masterful servant, no doubt, to them both, but he loved them sincerely and was deeply grateful for their kindness. He lived at their house at Streatham as much as he liked, and had his own room reserved for him both there and at their London house. At Streatham he sometimes remained for several months, and it is chiefly there that Boswell&rsquo;s only rival, Fanny Burney, saw him. It may be said that the Thrales&rsquo; house was more of a home to him than anything else he ever knew: it was at&nbsp; least the only house since his childhood in which he ever lived with children. There in the garden or in the library he studied and idled and talked at his ease; there many of his friends gathered round him; there his wishes were anticipated and his words listened to, sometimes with fear, sometimes with amusement, sometimes with reverence, always with affection and almost always with admiration. Well might he write to Mrs. Thrale as he did in October 1777: &ldquo;I cannot but think on your kindness and my master&rsquo;s. Life has upon the whole fallen short, very short, of my early expectation; but the acquisition of such a friendship, at an age when new friendships are seldom acquired, is something better than the general course of things gives man a right to expect. I think on it with great delight. I am not very apt to be delighted.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson had now become a comparatively prosperous man, and the lives of the prosperous have a way of producing little to record. He received many honours and compliments of different sorts. Dublin University made him LL.D. in 1765, he had his well-known interview with George III in 1767, the Royal Academy appointed him their Professor in Ancient Literature in 1769, and in 1775 he received the honorary degree of D.C.L. from the University of Oxford. But the only events&nbsp; of any special importance in the last twenty years of his life were the publication of his <span class="t8">Shakespeare</span> in 1765, his journey in Scotland with Boswell in 1773, and the writing of his last and most popular book, <span class="t8">The Lives of the Poets</span>. This he undertook in 1777 and completed in 1781. Its easier style, pleasant digressions, and occasional bits of autobiography, represent the change that had come over Johnson&rsquo;s life. He was now a man at ease and wrote like one. For the note of disappointed youthful ambition which is only half concealed in the earlier works it substitutes an old man&rsquo;s kindliness of retrospect. Matters of less importance in these years were the publication of his <span class="t8">Journey to the Western Islands</span>, of the <span class="t8">Prologue</span> to Goldsmith&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Good-Natured Man</span> and of his political pamphlets, <span class="t8">The False Alarm</span>, <span class="t8">Falkland&rsquo;s Islands</span>, <span class="t8">The Patriot</span>, and <span class="t8">Taxation no Tyranny</span>. But none of these things except the <span class="t8">Lives of the Poets</span> occupied much of his time, and his principal occupation in his old age was talking to his friends. He travelled a good deal, often visiting Oxford, his old home at Lichfield, and his friend Taylor&rsquo;s house in Derbyshire. In 1775 he went to France with the Thrales, and even in his last year was planning a tour to Italy. But by that time the motive was rather health than pleasure. He had a&nbsp; paralytic stroke in 1783 and lost his powers of speech for some days. One of the doctors who attended him was Dr. Heberden, who had cured Cowper of a still graver illness twenty years earlier. His strong constitution enabled him to recover rapidly, and within a month he was paying visits in Kent and Wiltshire. But he had other complaints, and never again knew even that modest measure of health which he had once enjoyed.</p>
<p class="p24">The inevitable loss of friends, that saddest and most universal sorrow of old age, joined with illness to depress his last years. Beauclerk died in 1780, Thrale in 1781, Levett and Mrs. Williams, two of the humble friends to whom his charity had given a home in his house, in 1782 and 1788. He was left almost alone. Yet the old courage and love of society asserted itself to the last, and he founded a new dining club the year before he died. But it was too late. The year 1784 opened with a prolonged illness lasting for months, and though in the summer he was well enough to get away to Oxford with Boswell once more, all could see that the end could not be far off. It came on the 18th of December 1784. He was buried in Westminster Abbey on December 20th. Burke and Windham, with Colman the dramatist and Sir Joseph Bankes the President of the Royal Society, were among the&nbsp; pall-bearers, and the mourners included Reynolds and Paoli. Seldom has the death of a man of letters created such a sense of loss either in the public at large or among his friends. Murphy, the editor of Fielding, and biographer of Garrick, says in his well-known essay that Johnson&rsquo;s death &ldquo;kept the public mind in agitation beyond all previous example.&rdquo; Those great men, then, who attended his funeral represented not merely themselves and his other friends but the intelligence of the whole nation, which saw in the death of Johnson the fall of one of the mighty in the moral and intellectual Israel.</p>
