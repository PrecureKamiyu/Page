The idea was to design the file system structures and allocation policies to be “disk aware” and thus improve performance, which is exactly what they did. FFS thus ush- ered in a new era of file system research; by keeping the same <i>interface </i>to the file system (the same APIs, including <span class="s41">open()</span>, <span class="s41">read()</span>, <span class="s41">write()</span>, <span class="s41">close()</span>, and other file system calls) but changing the internal <i>implemen- tation</i>, the authors paved the path for new file system construction, work that continues today. Virtually all modern file systems adhere to the ex- isting interface (and thus preserve compatibility with applications) while changing their internals for performance, reliability, or other reasons.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part453.htm">&lt; 上一个</a><span> | </span><a href="../ostep.html">内容</a><span> | </span><a href="part455.htm">下一个 &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
