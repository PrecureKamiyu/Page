Hopefully, most of the details were easy to follow, as you should have already had a good understanding of most of the basic mech- anisms and policies. More detail is available in the excellent (and short) paper by Levy and Lipman [LL82]; we encourage you to read it, a great way to see what the source material behind these chapters is like.</p><p style="padding-left: 68pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">You should also learn more about the state of the art by reading about Linux and other modern systems when possible. There is a lot of source material out there, including some reasonable books [BC05]. One thing that will amaze you: how classic ideas, found in old papers such as this one on VAX/VMS, still influence how modern operating systems are built.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part255.htm">&lt; 上一个</a><span> | </span><a href="../ostep.html">内容</a><span> | </span><a href="part257.htm">下一个 &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
