<p class="p10">THE RELIGIOUS SIDE OF DR. JOHNSON&rsquo;S CHARACTER</p>
<p class="p21">WISHING, about a year ago, to purchase a copy of <span class="t8">Prayers and Meditations</span>, the writer had to advertise for it in the <span class="t8">Publishers&rsquo; Circular.</span> So far as he knows, it is many years since the last edition was issued from the press. Moreover, in conversation with a considerable number of acquaintances, all of whom were readers of Boswell, he discovered that not one of them had ever seen the book. Some knew of it in a furtive kind of way, and others had read extracts from it in Boswell and elsewhere. That was all. It was thought, therefore, that a new edition of the work would be welcomed by the public. For though it is asserted that while everybody reads Boswell, only the literary student buys the collected works of Johnson, it seemed likely, for several reasons, that <span class="t8">Prayers and Meditations</span> would form an exception. In the first place, the book is comparatively small, and occupies a unique position among the compositions of the author. In the next place, it is intrinsically worthy to take permanent rank among books of devotional literature. And in the third place, and chiefly, it gives an insight into the religious character of Johnson, without which no completely accurate judgment of the man can be formed.</p>
<p class="p24">It is true that careful readers of Boswell cannot but notice how frequently he draws attention to the scrupulous piety and evangelical faith of his hero. But amid the great mass of material which Boswell brings together, the endless anecdotes, the brilliant conversations and disquisitions on all manner of subjects, and the constant movement of distinguished personages across his pages, those side references to the religious faith of Johnson are apt to be neglected, or, at all events, to receive only a cursory attention. In <span class="t8">Prayers and Meditations we </span>see the veil lifted. We are allowed to look into the private soul-life of Johnson. The hilarity of the tavern supper, the discussions of the literary club, the strenuous political controversy, the social circle at Thrale&rsquo;s, at Strahan&rsquo;s, and at Sir Joshua Reynolds&rsquo;, &mdash; all this we leave behind; and we follow the stalwart fighter home to the privacy of his room, and his solitary communings with God and his own heart. And there we see a different man from the loud talker, the ardent and sometimes ferocious disputant, or the convivial friend as he was known to his associates in the outside world. A different man, and yet the same. For in the humility as of a little child in which he bows before the Throne of Grace; in the remorseless condemnation of his vices and sins, his sloth and broken vows; in his earnest and penitent pleas for pardon and amendment; we see something of the same vehemence of passion which marked his daily life among men.</p>
<p class="p24">A recent American writer, one who loves and admires Johnson&rsquo;s prayers, objects to the publication of the <span class="t8">Meditations</span> in the minuti√¶ of their introspection, the mingling of pious ejaculations and descriptions of bodily sickness and remedies. From these published details he thinks Johnson himself would shrink, and that no good end can be served by them. This rather late and superfine objection is completely answered by the fact that Johnson himself gave the Diary to Strahan for publication; and by the further consideration that it is good for posterity to see the inner life of a great man who lived over a century ago, who, to us, is one of the most important personages of those times, and who was the last man likely to wish that any part of his life should be cautiously hidden from view. For, surely, no great man so habitually and fearlessly showed himself to others as he really was &mdash; in all the strength and weakness, the greatness and littleness of his character. And there were few things that his rough, blunt honesty despised more than squeamishness, or any sort of false sentiment, in matters of this kind. May it not also be urged that no sympathetic heart can rise from the perusal of these disjointed diary-jottings of the soul-life of Johnson without being the better for it himself, and without having a tenderer regard for the writer of them?</p>
<p class="p24">How few people, comparatively, ever think of Johnson as a profoundly religious man. Yet such he was. And religion influenced his daily life and thought in a remarkable degree. None the less so, because it happened to be tinged with ceremonialism on the one hand, and, on the other hand, sometimes lapsed into superstitions and scruples which seem odd in so strong a character. Of Dr. Campbell he said, &lsquo;Campbell is a good man, a pious man. I am afraid he has not been in the inside of a church for many years; but he never passes a church without pulling off his hat. This shows that he has good principles.&rsquo; That is sheer formalism. So, likewise, is his scrupulous observance of fast-days. His inclination to believe in ghosts, apparitions, dreams, and witchcraft, reveals, on the other hand, a credulity verging on superstition, and is in keeping with his habit of touching all the posts between the Mitre tavern and his lodgings. But it would be very foolish to conclude from these odd, half-concealed characteristics that Johnson&rsquo;s religion was superficial, credulous, or merely ceremonial. As will be seen from his Opinions on revealed religion and doctrine, which are printed at the end of this volume, he had very clear and decided views on the great dogmas of the Christian Church. And it is equally clear from his habits of personal devotion that what the old divines used to call &lsquo;the root of the matter&rsquo; was in him. Day by day he tried to live, in the sight of the Eternal, a life of devout and Scriptural piety. That he enumerates and mourns his failures to do so with painful penitence and sorrow, only emphasises the sincerity and genuineness of his religion. As a matter of fact, no man of his time had larger, healthier, and saner views on the real nature of godliness and practical Christian duty. In some religious circles of the day the revival of evangelicalism and the rise of Methodism had led to formalism and precision of dress, and to a corresponding outcry against elegance and fashion.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To the arguments urged by some very worthy people against showy dress,&rsquo; Macaulay says, &lsquo;Johnson replied with admirable sense and spirit, &ldquo;Let us not be found, when our Master calls us, stripping the lace off our waistcoats, but the spirit of contention from our souls and tongues. Alas! sir, a man who cannot get to heaven in a green coat, will not find his way thither the sooner in a grey one.&rsquo;&rdquo; And though, as Macaulay goes on to say, Johnson himself was under the tyranny of scruples, and gravely records in his Diary that he once committed the sin of drinking coffee on Good Friday, this by no means detracts from the fact that in all essential things his religion was sound and Scriptural.</p>
<p class="p24">Correctness of opinion, orthodoxy in doctrine, do not alone or pre-eminently constitute a religious man. Supremely above these things in importance is what a great modern preacher once called &lsquo;orthodoxy of the heart.&rsquo; And orthodoxy of the heart, we know, may co-exist with indecision or even positive heresy on some dogmas of the Church as generally received and interpreted. Right through the history of the Christian Church have not saintly lives of the finest type been found among those who have been branded with the sin of heresy? And who that reads the religious literature of to-day, or mixes in thoughtful religious circles, will controvert the fact that some of the most devout and sweet-souled Christians one meets, must be reckoned among those who, on some of the generally accepted Christian dogmas, are outside the pale of orthodoxy. So that, to base Johnson&rsquo;s character as a religious man either on the general soundness of his views on Christian doctrine, or his ardent churchmanship, or both, would be to fashion a chain of very inconclusive reasoning. But all the same religion, to be vital, must have some sure foundation of rational belief. And the <span class="t8">Christian</span> religion, assuredly, based as it is on a historic Person and a divine Revelation, can have no motive force on conduct unless it is founded on accepted dogma. Otherwise it is mere speculative opinion, or uncertain emotion, and cannot be trusted radically to change and determine human life and destiny. No man will live, or die, for an opinion, however beautiful, which in his heart he feels may, or may not, be true.</p>
<p class="p24">The clearness which marked Johnson&rsquo;s belief in the cardinal doctrines of the Christian religion is what might be expected from his keen logical faculty and decision of character. But more admirable still was his firm persuasion that saving faith meant a great deal more than intellectual consent to the truths of Christianity; that it meant, indeed, the daily worship of God, penitence for sin, and personal trust in Christ as the Saviour of men. This is made abundantly evident in his <span class="t8">Prayers and Meditations.</span> No sympathetic reader of this book can see its author, as the hour of midnight steals on, kneeling in solemn silence before his God, or listen to him as with strong cries and tears he confesses his sins and pleads for pardon, and doubt the sincerity of his piety. There the gruff, overbearing dogmatist feels and pleads his weakness, and humbly clings for protection from the penalty of sin, and the woes of time and eternity, to the skirts of the Most High. Equally marked, also, was the influence of religion on Johnson&rsquo;s everyday life. His steadfast adherence to truth, his keen distinction between right and wrong, vice and virtue, and his brooding sense of responsibility for the work given him to do were accompanied by unstinted benevolence and the most generous kindness to all who were in need. His house was a refuge for the infirm and the destitute among his friends, and the untiring patience with which he bore the peevish ill-temper of Mrs. Williams and the gentle consideration he showed her, excited not only the admiration, but almost the anger of his friends. Few men had more glaring defects of Christian character, but few men showed a more anxious desire to amend what was amiss, and to live in the fear of God, and the service of his fellows. Dr. Strahan knew Johnson intimately. In the original preface to this work he writes thus of him: &lsquo;The integrity of his mind was not only speculatively shadowed in his writings, but substantially exemplified in his life. His prayers and his alms, like those of the good Cornelius, went up for a continual memorial; and always from a heart deeply impressed with piety, never insensible to the calls of friendship or compassion, and prone to melt in effusions of tenderness on the slightest incitement.&rsquo; Murphy, the editor of his collected works, who knew him equally well, is equally emphatic in his testimony. In his essay on Johnson he says: &lsquo;Since virtue, or moral goodness, consists in a joint conformity of our actions to the relations in which we stand to the Supreme Being and to our fellow creatures, where shall we find a man who has been, or endeavoured to be, more diligent in the discharge of those essential duties? His first prayer was composed in 1738; he continued those fervent ejaculations of piety to the end of his life. In his Meditations we see him scrutinising himself with severity and aiming at perfection unattainable by man. His duty to his neighbour consisted in universal benevolence and a constant aim at the production of happiness.&rsquo; Such is the judgment of men who knew Johnson intimately. Upon two speculative religious subjects the opinions of Johnson have been much canvassed, viz., his belief in apparitions and dreams, and his practice of praying for the dead. Those questions need not be discussed at length here. They involve opinions or pious hopes, which, in the judgment of many people, may be either cherished or rejected without any infringement of the Christian faith. It is beyond controversy, that appearances of departed spirits are occasionally recorded in the Bible, and that good men in ancient times were profoundly influenced by dreams and visions. Johnson, undoubtedly, admitted the <span class="t8">possibility</span> of apparitions, and in one of the prayers in memory of his wife, he expresses the desire that God may permit him to enjoy his wife&rsquo;s ministrations by &lsquo;appearance, impulse, or dreams.&rsquo; In his <span class="t8">Rasselas</span>, also, he maintains the credibility of apparitions. But beyond that he does not go. He takes the same ground in his prayers for the dead, though from his long-continued use of these prayers it may be inferred that, on this question, he approached more nearly to certainty of faith. Still, he is always careful to note that he offers such petitions &lsquo;as far as might be lawful&rsquo; for him to do so. If this must be reckoned as a superstition, then, as Strahan observes, it is of all superstitions &lsquo;the least unamiable, and most incident to a good mind.&rsquo; But is it a superstition? Without giving adhesion to the gross development of the Roman Catholic doctrine of Purgatory, many Christian people of to-day have been graciously led to believe in the probability of an intermediate state. So many of our loved ones die, of whom it may be said, as was said of Rob Roy, that they were &lsquo;ower bad for blessing, and ower good for banning.&rsquo; Indeed, who, even of the best among us, will affirm that he is prepared by a life of saintly consecration to enter at once the heaven of the pure in heart, who alone can see God? Anyway, there are some thousands of stricken hearts in Britain to-day to whom the growing belief in an intermediate state has brought the comfort of God. It is a message of living and loving hope in the dreary waste of life&rsquo;s bereavements.</p>
<p class="p24">Surely the least we can do is to let the great hope bide!</p>
