Illustration "a" includes three elements: a router in the center, a server to the left representing the sender of the file, and a desktop computer labeled "client" to the right representing the recipient of the file. The server and the client are connected to the router by a communications link; the link from the server to the router is labeled "Rs" and the link from the router to the client is labeled "Rc."</p><p id="P700101195200000000000000000984B" data-uri="M01_KURO4140_07_SE_C01.xhtml#P700101195200000000000000000984B">Example "b" is similar, but with more elements: from left to right we see a server representing the sender of the file, which is connected by a communications link to a router. This communications link is labeled "R1." The first router is connected by a communications link to a second router, and this communications link is labeled "R2." The second router is connected by a communications link to a third router, and this communications link displays the transmission rate of "..." The third router is connected by a communications link to the client, and this communications link is labeled "Rn."</p></div></section></body></html>
