Although many technologies and standards for wireless LANs were developed in the 1990s, one particular class of standards has clearly emerged as the winner: the <span class="keyword" id="P700101195200000000000000000296E" data-uri="M07_KURO4140_07_SE_C07.xhtml#P700101195200000000000000000296E"><b>IEEE 802.11 wireless LAN</b></span>, also known as <span class="keyword" id="P700101195200000000000000000296F" data-uri="M07_KURO4140_07_SE_C07.xhtml#P700101195200000000000000000296F"><b>WiFi</b></span>. In this section, we’ll take a close look at 802.11 wireless LANs, examining its frame structure, its medium access protocol, and its internetworking of 802.11 LANs with wired Ethernet LANs.</p>
<p id="P700101195200000000000000000B325" data-uri="M07_KURO4140_07_SE_C07.xhtml#P700101195200000000000000000B325">There are several 802.11 standards for wireless LAN technology in the IEEE 802.11 (“WiFi”) family, as summarized in <a class="xref" href="#P7001011952000000000000000002972" data-foobar="1"><span class="label">Table</span> <span class="number">7.1</span></a>. The different 802.11 standards all share some common characteristics. They all use the same medium access protocol, CSMA/CA, which we’ll discuss shortly. All three use the same frame structure for their link-layer frames as well. All three standards have the ability to reduce their transmission rate in order to reach out over greater distances. And, importantly, 802.11 products are also all backwards compatible, meaning, for example, that a mobile capable only of 802.11g may still interact with a newer 802.11ac base station.</p>

The 2.4 GHz range is an unlicensed frequency band, where 802.11 devices may compete for frequency spectrum with 2.4 GHz phones and microwave ovens. At 5 GHz, 802.11 LANs have a shorter transmission distance for a given power level and suffer more from multipath propagation.

An ad hoc network might be formed when people with laptops get together (for example, in a conference room, a train, or a car) and want to exchange data in the absence of a centralized AP.

For example, in many cafés in New York City, a wireless station can pick up a signal from numerous nearby APs. One of the APs might be managed by the café, while the other APs might be in residential apartments near the café. Each of these APs would likely be located in a different IP subnet and would have been independently assigned a channel.</p>

But how does your wireless device associate with a particular AP? And more fundamentally, how does your wireless device know which APs, if any, are out there in the jungle?</p>

While a high signal strength is good (see, e.g., <a class="xref" href="fileP7001011952000000000000000002916.xhtml#P7001011952000000000000000002928" data-foobar="7"><span class="label">Figure</span> <span class="number">7.3</span></a>), signal strength is not the only AP characteristic that will determine the performance a device receives. In particular, it’s possible that the selected AP may have a strong signal, but may be overloaded with other affiliated devices (that will need to share the wireless bandwidth at that AP), while an unloaded AP is not selected due to a slightly weaker signal. A number of alternative ways of choosing APs have thus recently been proposed [Vasudevan 2005; <a class="biblioref" href="fileP70010119520000000000000000037E0.xhtml#P7001011952000000000000000003A75" data-foobar="7">Nicholson 2006</a>; <a class="biblioref" href="fileP70010119520000000000000000037E0.xhtml#P7001011952000000000000000003C39" data-foobar="7">Sundaresan 2006]</a>.

But because multiple wireless devices, or the AP itself may want to transmit data frames at the same time over the same channel, a multiple access protocol is needed to coordinate the transmissions. In the following, we'll refer to the devices or the AP as wireless “stations” that share the multiple access channel. As discussed in <a class="xref" href="fileP70010119520000000000000000023B1.xhtml#P70010119520000000000000000023B1" data-foobar="7"><span class="label">Chapter</span> <span class="number">6</span></a> and <a class="xref" href="fileP7001011952000000000000000002916.xhtml#P7001011952000000000000000002946" data-foobar="7"><span class="label">Section</span> <span class="number">7.2.1</span></a>, broadly speaking there are three classes of multiple access protocols: channel partitioning (including CDMA), random access, and taking turns. Inspired by the huge success of Ethernet and its random access protocol, the designers of 802.11 chose a random access protocol for 802.11 wireless LANs. This random access protocol is referred to as <span class="keyword" id="P70010119520000000000000000029BF" data-uri="M07_KURO4140_07_SE_C07.xhtml#P70010119520000000000000000029BF"><b>CSMA with collision avoidance</b></span>, or more succinctly as <span class="keyword" id="P70010119520000000000000000029C0" data-uri="M07_KURO4140_07_SE_C07.xhtml#P70010119520000000000000000029C0"><b>CSMA/CA</b></span>. As with Ethernet’s CSMA/CD, the “CSMA” in CSMA/CA stands for “carrier sense multiple access,” meaning that each station senses the channel before transmitting, and refrains from transmitting when the channel is sensed busy. Although both ­Ethernet and 802.11 use carrier-sensing random access, the two MAC protocols have important differences. First, instead of using collision detection, 802.11 uses collision-avoidance techniques. Second, because of the relatively high bit error rates of wireless channels, 802.11 (unlike Ethernet) uses a link-layer acknowledgment/retransmission (ARQ) scheme. We’ll describe 802.11’s collision-avoidance and link-layer acknowledgment schemes below.</p>

If, while transmitting, it detects that another station is also transmitting, it aborts its transmission and tries to transmit again after waiting a small, random amount of time. Unlike the 802.3 Ethernet protocol, the 802.11 MAC protocol does <i>not</i> implement collision detection. There are two important reasons for this:</p>

<p id="P700101195200000000000000000B373" data-uri="M07_KURO4140_07_SE_C07.xhtml#P700101195200000000000000000B373">To answer this question, let’s consider a scenario in which two stations each have a data frame to transmit, but neither station transmits immediately because each senses that a third station is already transmitting. With Ethernet’s CSMA/CD, the two stations would each transmit as soon as they detect that the third station has finished transmitting. This would cause a collision, which isn’t a serious issue in CSMA/CD, since both stations would abort their transmissions and thus avoid the useless transmissions of the remainders of their frames. In 802.11, however, the situation is quite different. Because 802.11 does not detect a collision and abort transmission, a frame suffering a collision will be transmitted in its entirety. The goal in 802.11 is thus to avoid collisions whenever possible. In 802.11, if the two stations sense the channel busy, they both immediately enter random backoff, hopefully choosing different backoff values. If these values are indeed different, once the channel becomes idle, one of the two stations will begin transmitting before the other, and (if the two stations are not hidden from each other) the “losing station” will hear the <span class="pagebreak" title="540" id="P70010119520000000000000000029E1" data-uri="M07_KURO4140_07_SE_C07.xhtml#P70010119520000000000000000029E1" epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>“winning station’s” signal, freeze its counter, and refrain from transmitting until the winning station has completed its transmission. In this manner, a costly collision is avoided. Of course, collisions can still occur with 802.11 in this scenario: The two stations could be hidden from each other, or the two stations could choose random backoff values that are close enough that the transmission from the station starting first have yet to reach the second station. Recall that we encountered this problem earlier in our discussion of random access algorithms in the context of <a class="xref" href="fileP700101195200000000000000000245F.xhtml#P7001011952000000000000000002505" data-foobar="7"><span class="label">Figure</span> <span class="number">6.12</span></a>.</p>

Let’s investigate this scheme in the context of <a class="xref" href="#P70010119520000000000000000029E9" data-foobar="1"><span class="label">Figure</span> <span class="number">7.11</span></a>, which shows two wireless ­stations and one access point. Both of the wireless stations are within range of the AP (whose ­coverage is shown as a shaded circle) and both have associated with the AP. ­However, due to fading, the signal ranges of wireless stations are limited to the interiors of the shaded circles shown in <a class="xref" href="#P70010119520000000000000000029E9" data-foobar="1"><span class="label">Figure</span> <span class="number">7.11</span></a>.

Suppose Station H1 is transmitting a frame and halfway through H1’s transmission, Station H2 wants to send a frame to the AP. H2, not hearing the transmission from H1, will first wait a DIFS interval and then transmit the frame, resulting in a collision. The channel will therefore be wasted during the entire period of H1’s transmission as well as during H2’s transmission.</p>

For this reason, the RTS/CTS exchange is only used (if at all) to reserve the channel for the transmission of a long DATA frame. In practice, each wireless station can set an RTS threshold such that the RTS/CTS sequence is used only when the frame is longer than the threshold. For many wireless stations, the default RTS threshold value is larger than the maximum frame length, so the RTS/CTS sequence is skipped for all DATA frames sent.</p>

We should mention that if two nodes each have a directional antenna, they can point their directional antennas at each other and run the 802.11 protocol over what is essentially a point-to-point link. Given the low cost of commodity 802.11 hardware, the use of directional antennas and an increased transmission power allow 802.11 to be used as an inexpensive means of providing wireless point-to-point connections over tens of kilometers distance. <a class="biblioref" href="fileP70010119520000000000000000037E0.xhtml#P7001011952000000000000000003ACC" data-foobar="7">[Raman 2007]</a> describes one of the first such multi-hop wireless networks, operating in the rural Ganges plains in India using point-to-point 802.11 links.</p>

Although the field is permitted to be as long as 2,312 bytes, it is typically fewer than 1,500 bytes, holding an IP datagram or an ARP packet. As with an Ethernet frame, an 802.11 frame includes a 32-bit cyclic redundancy check (CRC) so that the receiver can detect bit errors in the received frame. As we’ve seen, bit errors are much more common in wireless LANs than in wired LANs, so the CRC is even more useful here.</p>

But why four address fields? Doesn’t a source MAC field and destination MAC field suffice, as they do for ­Ethernet? It turns out that three address fields are needed for internetworking ­purposes—specifically, for moving the network-layer datagram from a wireless station through an AP to a router interface. The fourth address field is used when APs ­forward frames to each other in ad hoc mode. Since we are only considering infrastructure networks here, let’s focus our attention on the first three address fields. The 802.11 standard defines these fields as follows:</p>

Thus, if a wireless station transmits the frame, that station’s MAC address is inserted in the address 2 field. Similarly, if an AP transmits the frame, the AP’s MAC address is inserted in the address 2 field.</p></li>

In this figure, there are two APs, each of which is responsible for a number of wireless stations. Each of the APs has a direct connection to a router, which in turn connects to the global Internet. We should keep in mind that an AP is a link-layer device, and thus neither “speaks” IP nor understands IP addresses. Consider now moving a datagram from the router interface R1 to the wireless Station H1. The router is not aware that there is an AP between it and H1; from the router’s perspective, H1 is just a host in one of the subnets to which it (the router) is connected.</p>

The source address field of this frame contains R1’s MAC address, and the destination address field contains H1’s MAC address.</p></li>

This naturally raises the issue of mobility among the BSSs—how do wireless stations seamlessly move from one BSS to another while maintaining ongoing TCP sessions? As we’ll see in this subsection, mobility can be handled in a relatively straightforward manner when the BSSs are part of the subnet. When stations move between subnets, more sophisticated mobility management protocols will be needed, such as those we’ll study in <a class="xref" href="fileP7001011952000000000000000002AF2.xhtml#P7001011952000000000000000002AF2" data-foobar="7"><span class="label">Sections</span> <span class="number">7.5</span></a> and <a class="xref" href="fileP7001011952000000000000000002B6D.xhtml#P7001011952000000000000000002B6D" data-foobar="7"><span class="number">7.6</span></a>.</p>

Because in this example the interconnection device that connects the two BSSs is <i>not</i> a router, all of the stations in the two BSSs, including the APs, belong to the same IP subnet. Thus, when H1 moves from BSS1 to BSS2, it may keep its IP address and all of its ongoing TCP connections. If the interconnection device were a router, then H1 would have to obtain a new IP address in the subnet in which it was moving. This address change would disrupt (and eventually terminate) any on-going TCP connections at H1.

As H1 wanders away from AP1, H1 detects a weakening signal from AP1 and starts to scan for a stronger signal. H1 receives beacon frames from AP2 (which in many corporate and university settings will have the same SSID as AP1). H1 then disassociates with AP1 and associates with AP2, while keeping its IP address and maintaining its ongoing TCP sessions.</p>

To appreciate the problem here, recall that before the move, the switch has an entry in its forwarding table that pairs H1’s MAC address with the outgoing switch interface through which H1 can be reached. If H1 is initially in BSS1, then a datagram destined to H1 will be directed to H1 via AP1. Once H1 associates with BSS2, however, its frames should be directed to AP2. One solution (a bit of a hack, really) is for AP2 to send a broadcast Ethernet frame with H1’s source address to the switch just after the new association. When the switch receives the frame, it updates its forwarding table, allowing H1 to be reached via AP2. The 802.11f standards group is developing an inter-AP protocol to handle these and related issues.</p>

This allows different vendors to implement these capabilities using their own (proprietary) approaches, presumably giving them an edge over the competition.</p>

Consider for example a mobile 802.11 user who is initially 20 meters away from the base station, with a high signal-to-noise ratio. Given the high SNR, the user can communicate with the base station using a physical-layer modulation technique that provides high transmission rates while maintaining a low BER. This is one happy user! Suppose now that the user becomes mobile, walking away from the base station, with the SNR falling as the distance from the base station increases. In this case, if the modulation technique used in the 802.11 protocol operating between the base station and the user does not change, the BER will become unacceptably high as the SNR decreases, and eventually no transmitted frames will be received correctly.</p>

If 10 frames in a row are acknowledged, or if a timer that tracks the time since the last fallback expires, the transmission rate increases to the next higher rate. This rate adaptation mechanism shares the same “probing” philosophy as TCP’s congestion-control mechanism—when conditions are good (reflected by ACK receipts), the transmission rate is increased until something “bad” happens (the lack of ACK receipts); when something “bad” happens, the transmission rate is reduced. 802.11 rate adaptation and TCP congestion control are thus similar to the young child who is constantly pushing his/her parents for more and more (say candy for a young child, later curfew hours for the teenager) until the parents finally say “Enough!” and the child backs off (only to try again later after conditions have hopefully improved!).

A node is able to explicitly alternate between sleep and wake states (not unlike a sleepy student in a classroom!). A node indicates to the access point that it will be going to sleep by setting the power-management bit in the header of an 802.11 frame to 1. A timer in the node is then set to wake up the node just before the AP is scheduled to send its beacon frame (recall that an AP typically sends a beacon frame every 100 msec). Since the AP knows from the set power-transmission bit that the node is going to sleep, it (the AP) knows that it should not send any frames to that node, and will buffer any frames destined for the sleeping host for later transmission.</p>

The beacon frames sent out by the AP contain a list of nodes whose frames have been buffered at the AP. If there are no buffered frames for the node, it can go back to sleep. Otherwise, the node can explicitly request that the buffered frames be sent by sending a polling message to the AP. With an inter-beacon time of 100 msec, a wakeup time of 250 microseconds, and a similarly small time to receive a beacon frame and check to ensure that there are no buffered frames, a node that has no frames to send or receive can be asleep 99% of the time, resulting in a significant energy savings.</p>

While Bluetooth networks provide a “cable replacement” data rate of over a Megabit per second, Zigbee is targeted at lower-powered, lower-data-rate, lower-duty-cycle applications than Bluetooth. While we may tend to think that “bigger and faster is better,” not all network applications need high bandwidth and the consequent higher costs (both economic and power costs). For example, home temperature and light sensors, security devices, and wall-mounted switches are all very simple, low-power, low-duty-cycle, low-cost devices. Zigbee is thus well-suited for these devices. Zigbee defines channel rates of 20, 40, 100, and 250 Kbps, depending on the channel frequency.</p>

So-called “reduced-function devices” operate as slave devices under the control of a single “full-function device,” much as Bluetooth slave devices. A full-function device can operate as a master device as in Bluetooth by controlling multiple slave devices, and multiple full-function devices can additionally be configured into a mesh network in which full-function devices route frames amongst themselves. Zigbee shares many protocol mechanisms that we’ve already encountered in other link-layer protocols: beacon frames and link-layer acknowledgments (similar to 802.11), carrier-sense random access protocols with binary exponential backoff (similar to 802.11 and Ethernet), and fixed, guaranteed allocation of time slots (similar to DOCSIS).</p>
