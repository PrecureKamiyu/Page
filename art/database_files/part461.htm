We note, however, that blockchains have many uses beyond cryptocurrencies.</p><p style="padding-left: 88pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">Traditional currencies, also known as “ﬁat currencies” are typically issued by a cen- tral bank of a country, and guaranteed by the government of that country. Currency notes are at one level just a piece of paper; the only reason they are of value is that the government that issues the currency guarantees the value of the currency, and users trust the government. Today, although ﬁnancial holdings continue to be denominated in terms of a currency, most of the ﬁnancial holdings are not physically present as cur- rency notes; they are merely entries in the ledger of a bank or other ﬁnancial institution. Users of the currency are forced to trust the organization that maintains the ledger.</p><p style="padding-left: 88pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">A <span class="s63">cryptocurrency </span>is a currency created purely online, and recorded in a way that does not require any one organization (or country) to be totally trusted. This term arises from the fact that any such scheme has to based on encryption technologies. Since any digital information can be copied easily, unlike currency notes, any cryptocurrency scheme must be able to prevent “double spending” of money. To solve this problem, cryptocurrencies use ledgers to record transactions. Further, the ledgers are stored a secure, distributed infrastructure, with no requirement to trust any one party. These two key concepts, decentralization and trustlessness, are fundamental to cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrenies typically aim, like regular currency, and unlike credit card or debit card transactions, to provide transaction anonymity, to preserve the privacy of users of the currency. However, since cryptocurrency blockchains are public data analytics may be used to compromise or limit anonymity.</p><p style="padding-left: 88pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">Bitcoin, which was the ﬁrst successful cryptocurrency, emerged with the publi- cation of a paper by Satoshi Nakamoto<span class="s76">1</span> in 2008 and the subsequent publication of the open-source Bitcoin code in 2009. The ideas in the original bitcoin paper solved</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 88pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="95" height="1" alt="image" src="Image_3463.png"/></span></p><p class="s77" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 88pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">1<span class="s78">Satoshi Nokamoto is a pseudonym for a person or group that anonymously created Bitcoin.</span></p><p class="s66" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 119pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;">26.1 <span style=" color: #00AEEF;">Overview  </span><span class="s164">1253</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 119pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">a number of problems, and thereby allowed cryptocurrencies, which had earlier been considered impractical, to become a reality.</p><p style="padding-left: 119pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">However, the underlying concepts and algorithms in many cases go back decades in their development. The brilliance of Nakamoto’s work was a combination of innova- tion and well-architected use of prior research. The successes of Bitcoin prove the value of this contribution, but the target — an anonymous, trustless, fully distributed concur- rency— drove many technical decisions in directions that work less well in a database setting. The Further Reading section at the end of the chapter cites key historical pa- pers in the development of these ideas.</p><p style="padding-left: 119pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">At its most basic level, a blockchain is a linked list of blocks of data that can be thought of as constituting a log of updates to data. What makes blockchain technology interesting is that blockchains can be managed in a distributed manner in such a way that they are highly tamper resistant, and cannot be easily modiﬁed or manipulated by any one participant, except by appending digitally signed records to the blockchain.</p><p style="padding-left: 119pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">In a business setting, trustless distributed control is valuable, but absolute anonymity runs counter to both principles of accounting and regulatory requirements. This leads to two main scenarios for the use of blockchains. Bitcoin’s blockchain is referred to as a <span class="s63">public blockchain</span>, since it allows any site to join and participate in the tasks of maintaining the blockchain. In contrast, most enterprise blockchains are more restricted and referred to as <span class="s63">permissioned blockchains</span>. In a permissioned blockchain, participation is not open to the public. Access is granted by a permissioning authority, which may be an enterprise, a consortium of enterprises, or a government agency.</p><p style="padding-left: 119pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">Bitcoin introduced a number of ideas that made public blockchains practical, but these have a signiﬁcant cost in terms of <span class="s44">CPU </span>power (and thereby, electrical power) needed to run the blockchain, as well as latencies in processing transactions. By re- laxing Bitcoin’s strong assumptions about trustlessness and anonymity, it is possible to overcome many of the ineﬃciencies and high latencies of the Bitcoin model and design blockchains that further the goals of enterprise data management.</p><p style="padding-left: 119pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">In this chapter, we begin by looking at the classic blockchain structure as used in Bitcoin and use that to introduce the key distinguishing properties of a blockchain. Achieving many of these properties relies upon one-way cryptographic hash functions. These hash functions are quite diﬀerent from those used in Chapter 24 as a means of indexing databases. Cryptographic hash functions need to have some speciﬁc mathe- matical properties such as the following: given a data value <i>x </i>and a hash function <i>h</i>, it must be relatively easy to compute <i>h</i>(<i>x</i>) but virtually impossible to ﬁnd <i>x </i>given <i>h</i>(<i>x</i>).</p><p style="padding-left: 119pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">When a blockchain is stored distributed across multiple systems, an important issue is to ensure that the participating systems agree on what are the contents of the blockchain, and what gets added to it at each step. When participants trust each other, but may be vulnerable to failure, consensus techniques that we studied earlier in Section</p><p style="padding-left: 119pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">23.8 can be used to ensure that all participants agree on the contents of a log (and a blockchain is, at its core, a log). However, reaching agreement on what data get added to a blockchain is much more challenging when participants in the blockchain do not trust each other and have no centralized control. The basic consensus algorithms are</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 88pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark562">not applicable in such a setting. For example, an attacker could create a large number of systems, each of which joins the blockchain as a participant; the attacker could thereby control a majority of the participating systems. Any decision based on a majority can then be controlled by the attacker, who can force decisions that can tamper with the contents of the blockchain. The tamper resistance property of the blockchain would then be compromised.</a><a name="bookmark592">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="padding-left: 88pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">We begin by describing the energy-intensive approach of Bitcoin, but we then con- sider a variety of alternative, more eﬃcient approaches used in other cryptocurrencies. Finally, we consider approaches based on Byzantine-consensus algorithms, which are consensus algorithms that are resistant to some fraction of the participating nodes not just failing, but also lying and attempting to disrupt consensus. Byzantine consensus is well-suited to an enterprise blockchain environment, and can be used if the blockchain is <i>permissioned</i>, that is, some organization controls who can have permission to ac- cess the blockchain. Byzantine consensus is an old problem and solutions have been around for many years. However, the special constraints of blockchain databases have led to some newer approaches to this problem. References to more details on Byzan- tine consensus techniques may be found in the Further Reading section at the end of the chapter.</p><p style="padding-left: 88pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">Blockchain databases store more than just currency-based debit-credit transac- tions. Like any database, they may store a variety of types of data about the enterprise. A traditional blockchain data organization makes it diﬃcult to retrieve such data eﬃ- ciently, but pairing a blockchain with a traditional database or building the blockchain on top of a database can enable faster query processing. We shall explore a variety of means of speeding up not only queries but also update transactions, both within the blockchain itself and by performing certain operations “oﬀ chain” and adding them in bulk to the blockchain at a later time.</p><p style="padding-left: 88pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">After covering blockchain algorithms, we shall explore (in Section 26.8) some of the most promising applications of blockchain databases.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part460.htm">&lt; 上一个</a><span> | </span><a href="../database.html">内容</a><span> | </span><a href="part462.htm">下一个 &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
