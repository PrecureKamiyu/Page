Several research projects, including <span class="s44">GAMMA </span>([DeWitt (1990)]), <span class="s44">XPRS </span>([Stonebraker et al. (1988)]), and Volcano ([Graefe (1990)]) were launched to investigate the practicality of parallel storage of data and parallel execution of queries. Teradata was one of the ﬁrst commercial shared-nothing parallel database systems designed for decision support systems, and it continues to have a large market share.</p><p class="s64" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 119pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;">Further Reading  <span class="s164">1037</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 119pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Teradata supports partitioning and replication of data to deal with node failures. The Red Brick Warehouse was another early parallel database system designed for decision support (Red Brick was bought by Informix, and later IBM).</p><p style="padding-left: 119pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">Information on the Google ﬁle system can be found in [Ghemawat et al. (2003)], while the Google Bigtable system is described in [Chang et al. (2008)]. The Yahoo! PNUTS system is described in [Cooper et al. (2008)], while Google Megastore and Google Spanner are described in [Baker et al. (2011)] and [Corbett et al. (2013)] re- spectively. Consistent hashing is described in [Karger et al. (1997)], while Dynamo, which is based on consistent hashing, is described in [DeCandia et al. (2007)].</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part395.htm">&lt; 上一个</a><span> | </span><a href="../database.html">内容</a><span> | </span><a href="part397.htm">下一个 &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
