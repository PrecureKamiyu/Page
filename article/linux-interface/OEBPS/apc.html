                arguments or arguments of varying types.</p></div><p>Whether the cast is required before the <code class="literal">NULL</code> in
            cases like this is the source of some confusion. While we can often get away without the
            cast, the C standards require it; failure to include it may lead an application to break
            on some systems.</p><p><code class="literal">NULL</code> is typically defined as either 0 or as
                <span class="emphasis"><em>(void *) 0</em></span>. (The C standards allow other definitions, but they
            are essentially equivalent to one of these two possibilities.) The main reason casts are
            needed is that <code class="literal">NULL</code> is allowed to be defined as 0, so
            this is the case we examine first.</p><p>The C preprocessor translates <code class="literal">NULL</code> to 0 before the
            source code is passed to the compiler. The C standards specify that the integer constant
            0 may be used in any context where a pointer may be used, and the compiler will ensure
            that this value is treated as a null pointer. In most cases, everything is fine, and we
            don’t need to worry about casts. We can, for example, write code such as the
            following:</p><a id="I_programlisting_d1e177437"/><pre class="programlisting">int *p;

p = 0;                                  /* Assign null pointer to 'p' */
p = NULL;                               /* Same as 'p = 0' */</pre><p>The above assignments work because the compiler can determine that a pointer value is
            required on the right-hand side of the assignment, and it will convert the value 0 to a
            null pointer.</p><p>Similarly, for functions with prototypes specifying a fixed argument list, we can
            specify either 0 or <code class="literal">NULL</code> for a pointer argument, to
            indicate that a null pointer should be passed to the function:</p><a id="I_programlisting_d1e177446"/><pre class="programlisting">sigaction(SIGINT, &amp;sa, 0);
sigaction(SIGINT, &amp;sa, NULL);           /* Equivalent to the preceding */</pre><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>If we are passing a null pointer to an old-style, nonprototyped C function, then
                all of the arguments given here about the need to appropriately cast 0 or <code class="literal">NULL</code> also apply, regardless of whether the argument is
                part of a variadic argument list.</p></div><p>Because casting is not required in any of the above examples, one might conclude that
            it is never required. But this is wrong. The need for casting arises when specifying a
            null pointer as one of the varying arguments in a call to a variadic function such as
                <span class="emphasis"><em>execl()</em></span>. To realize why this is necessary, we need to be aware
            of the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>The compiler can’t determine the expected types of the varying arguments of a
                    variadic function.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The C standards don’t require that a null pointer is actually represented in
                    the same way as the integer constant 0. (In theory, a null pointer could be
                    represented by any bit pattern that wasn’t the same as a valid pointer.) Nor do
                    the standards even require that a null pointer is the same size as the integer
                    constant 0. All that the standards require is that when the integer constant 0
                    is found in a context where a pointer is expected, the 0 should be interpreted
                    as a null pointer.</p></li></ul></div><p>Consequently, it is wrong to write either of the following:</p><a id="I_programlisting_d1e177469"/><pre class="programlisting">execl(prog, arg, 0);
execl(prog, arg, NULL);</pre><p>This is an error because the compiler will pass the integer constant 0 to
                <span class="emphasis"><em>execl()</em></span>, and there is no guarantee that this is equivalent to a
            null pointer.</p><p>In practice, we can often get away without the cast, since, on many C implementations
            (e.g., Linux/x86-32), the representations of the integer (<span class="emphasis"><em>int</em></span>)
            constant 0 and the null pointer are the same. However, there are implementations where
            they are not—for example, where the size of a null pointer is larger than the size of
            the integer constant 0—so that in the above examples, <span class="emphasis"><em>execl()</em></span> is
            likely to receive some random bits adjacent to the integer 0, and the resulting value
            will be interpreted as a random (nonnull) pointer. Omitting the cast leads to programs
            breaking when ported to such implementations. (On some of the aforementioned
            implementations, <code class="literal">NULL</code> is defined as the
                <span class="emphasis"><em>long</em></span> integer constant <span class="emphasis"><em>0L</em></span>, and
                <span class="emphasis"><em>long</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>void *</em></span> have the same size, which
            may save wrongly constructed programs that use the second of the
                <span class="emphasis"><em>execl()</em></span> calls above.) Therefore, we should rewrite the above
                <span class="emphasis"><em>execl()</em></span> calls in the following ways:</p><a id="I_programlisting_d1e177506"/><pre class="programlisting">execl(prog, arg, (char *) 0);
execl(prog, arg, (char *) NULL);</pre><p>Casting <code class="literal">NULL</code> in the manner of the last call above
            is generally required, even on implementations where <code class="literal">NULL</code> is defined as <span class="emphasis"><em>(void *) 0</em></span>. This is because,
            although the C standards require that null pointers of different types should test true
            for comparisons on equality, they don’t require that pointers of different types have
            the same internal representation (although on most implementations they do). And, as
            before, in a variadic function, the compiler can’t cast <span class="emphasis"><em>(void *) 0</em></span>
            to a null pointer of the appropriate type.</p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>The C standards make one exception to the rule that pointers of different types
                need not have the same representation: pointers of the types <span class="emphasis"><em>char
                    *</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>void *</em></span> are required to have the same
                internal representation. This means that passing <span class="emphasis"><em>(void *) 0</em></span>
                instead of <span class="emphasis"><em>(char *) 0</em></span> would not be a problem in the example
                case of <span class="emphasis"><em>execl()</em></span>, but, in the general case, a cast is
                needed.</p></div></section></body></html>
