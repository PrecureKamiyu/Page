Disks typically support either the <span class="s63">Serial </span><span class="s82">ATA </span>(<span class="s64">SATA</span>) interface, or the <span class="s63">Serial Attached </span><span class="s82">SCSI </span>(<span class="s64">SAS</span>) interface; the <span class="s44">SAS </span>interface is typically used only in servers. The <span class="s44">SATA</span>-3 version of <span class="s44">SATA </span>nominally supports 6 gigabytes per second, allowing data transfer speeds of up to 600 megabytes per second, while <span class="s44">SAS </span>version 3 supports data transfer rates of 12 gigabits per second. The <span class="s63">Non- Volatile Memory Express </span>(<span class="s64">NVM</span><span class="s84">e</span>) interface is a logical interface standard developed to better support <span class="s44">SSDs </span>and is typically used with the <span class="s44">PCI</span>e interface (the <span class="s44">PCI</span>e interface provides high-speed data transfer internal to computer systems).</p><p style="padding-left: 88pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">While disks are usually connected directly by cables to the disk interface of the computer system, they can be situated remotely and connected by a high-speed network to the computer. In the <span class="s63">storage area network </span>(<span class="s64">SAN</span>) architecture, large numbers of disks are connected by a high-speed network to a number of server computers. The disks are usually organized locally using a storage organization technique called <i>redundant arrays of independent disks </i>(<span class="s44">RAID</span>) (described later, in Section 12.5), to give the servers a logical view of a very large and very reliable disk.

Recent years have also seen the growth of <span class="s63">cloud storage</span>, where data are stored in the cloud and accessed via an <span class="s44">API</span>. Cloud storage has a very high latency of tens to hundreds of milliseconds, if the data are not co-located with the database, and is thus not ideal as the underlying storage for databases. However, applications often use cloud storage for storing objects. Cloud-based storage systems are discussed further in Section 21.7.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part232.htm">&lt; 上一个</a><span> | </span><a href="../database.html">内容</a><span> | </span><a href="part234.htm">下一个 &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
