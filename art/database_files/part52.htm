Those earlier applications were relatively simple com- pared to modern database applications. Modern applications include highly sophisti- cated, worldwide enterprises.</p><p style="padding-left: 119pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">All database applications, old and new, share important common elements. The central aspect of the application is not a program performing some calculation, but rather the data themselves. Today, some of the most valuable corporations are valuable not because of their physical assets, but rather because of the information they own. Imagine a bank without its data on accounts and customers or a social-network site that loses the connections among its users. Such companies’ value would be almost totally lost under such circumstances.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s20" style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;">1</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 106pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Database systems are used to manage collections of data that:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s39" style="padding-left: 91pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• <span class="s40">are highly valuable,</span></p><p class="s39" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 91pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• <span class="s40">are relatively large, and</span></p><p class="s39" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 91pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• <span class="s40">are accessed by multiple users and applications, often at the same time.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 88pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">The ﬁrst database applications had only simple, precisely formatted, structured data. Today, database applications may include data with complex relationships and a more variable structure. As an example of an application with structured data, consider a university’s records regarding courses, students, and course registration. The univer- sity keeps the same type of information about each course: course-identiﬁer, title, de- partment, course number, etc., and similarly for students: student-identiﬁer, name, ad- dress, phone, etc. Course registration is a collection of pairs: one course identiﬁer and one student identiﬁer. Information of this sort has a standard, repeating structure and is representative of the type of database applications that go back to the 1960s. Con- trast this simple university database application with a social-networking site. Users of the site post varying types of information about themselves ranging from simple items such as name or date of birth, to complex posts consisting of text, images, videos, and links to other users. There is only a limited amount of common structure among these data. Both of these applications, however, share the basic features of a database.</p><p style="padding-left: 88pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">Modern database systems exploit commonalities in the structure of data to gain eﬃciency but also allow for weakly structured data and for data whose formats are highly variable. As a result, a database system is a large, complex software system whose task is to manage a large, complex collection of data.</p><p style="padding-left: 88pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">Managing complexity is challenging, not only in the management of data but in any domain. Key to the management of complexity is the concept of <i>abstraction</i>. Ab- straction allows a person to use a complex device or system without having to know the details of how that device or system is constructed. A person is able, for example, to drive a car by knowing how to operate its controls. However, the driver does not need to know how the motor was built nor how it operates. All the driver needs to know is an abstraction of what the motor does. Similarly, for a large, complex collection of data, a database system provides a simpler, abstract view of the information so that users and application programmers do not need to be aware of the underlying details of how data are stored and organized. By providing a high level of abstraction, a database sys- tem makes it possible for an enterprise to combine data of various types into a uniﬁed repository of the information needed to run the enterprise.</p><p style="padding-left: 106pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Here are some representative applications:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s39" style="padding-left: 91pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">• <span class="s46">Enterprise Information</span></p><p class="s50" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 113pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">° <span class="s46">Sales: </span><span class="p">For customer, product, and purchase information.</span></p><p class="s66" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 322pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">1.1 <span style=" color: #00AEEF;">Database-System Applications</span><span class="s67">   </span><span class="s20">3</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s50" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 153pt;text-indent: -8pt;line-height: 77%;text-align: justify;">° <span class="s46">Accounting: </span><span class="p">For payments, receipts, account balances, assets, and other ac- counting information.</span></p><p class="s50" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 153pt;text-indent: -8pt;line-height: 77%;text-align: justify;">° <span class="s46">Human resources: </span><span class="p">For information about employees, salaries, payroll taxes, and beneﬁts, and for generation of paychecks.</span></p><p class="s39" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 139pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: justify;">• <span class="s46">Manufacturing: </span><span class="p">For management of the supply chain and for tracking production of items in factories, inventories of items in warehouses and stores, and orders for items.</span></p><p class="s39" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 123pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">• <span class="s46">Banking and Finance</span></p><p class="s50" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 145pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">° <span class="s46">Banking: </span><span class="p">For customer information, accounts, loans, and banking transactions.</span></p><p class="s50" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 153pt;text-indent: -8pt;line-height: 77%;text-align: justify;">° <span class="s46">Credit card transactions: </span><span class="p">For purchases on credit cards and generation of monthly statements.</span></p><p class="s50" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 153pt;text-indent: -8pt;line-height: 77%;text-align: right;">° <span class="s46">Finance: </span><span class="p">For storing information about holdings, sales, and purchases of ﬁnan- cial instruments such as stocks and bonds; also for storing real-time market</span></p><p style="padding-left: 119pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;">data to enable online trading by customers and automated trading by the ﬁrm.</p><p class="s39" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 139pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: justify;">• <span class="s46">Universities: </span><span class="p">For student information, course registrations, and grades (in addition to standard enterprise information such as human resources and accounting).</span></p><p class="s39" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 139pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: justify;">• <span class="s46">Airlines: </span><span class="p">For reservations and schedule information.

Early databases were maintained as back-oﬃce systems with which users interacted via printed reports and paper forms for input. As database systems became more sophisti- cated, better languages were developed for programmers to use in interacting with the data, along with user interfaces that allowed end users within the enterprise to query and update data.</p><p style="padding-left: 88pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">As the support for programmer interaction with databases improved, and computer hardware performance increased even as hardware costs decreased, more sophisticated applications emerged that brought database data into more direct contact not only with end users within an enterprise but also with the general public. Whereas once bank customers had to interact with a teller for every transaction, automated-teller machines (<span class="s44">ATM</span>s) allowed direct customer interaction. Today, virtually every enterprise employs web applications or mobile applications to allow its customers to interact directly with the enterprise’s database, and, thus, with the enterprise itself.</p><p style="padding-left: 88pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">The user, or customer, can focus on the product or service without being aware of the details of the large database that makes the interaction possible. For instance, when you read a social-media post, or access an online bookstore and browse a book or music collection, you are accessing data stored in a database. When you enter an order online, your order is stored in a database. When you access a bank web site and retrieve your bank balance and transaction information, the information is retrieved from the bank’s database system. When you access a web site, information about you may be retrieved from a database to select which advertisements you should see. Almost every interaction with a smartphone results in some sort of database access. Furthermore, data about your web accesses may be stored in a database.</p><p style="padding-left: 88pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">Thus, although user interfaces hide details of access to a database, and most people are not even aware they are dealing with a database, accessing databases forms an essential part of almost everyone’s life today.</p><p style="padding-left: 106pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Broadly speaking, there are two modes in which databases are used.</p><p class="s39" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 107pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: justify;">• <span class="s40">The ﬁrst mode is to support </span><span class="s63">online transaction processing</span><span class="p">, where a large number of users use the database, with each user retrieving relatively small amounts of data, and performing small updates. This is the primary mode of use for the vast majority of users of database applications such as those that we outlined earlier.</span></p><p class="s39" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 107pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: justify;">• <span class="s40">The second mode is to support </span><span class="s63">data analytics</span><span class="p">, that is, the processing of data to draw conclusions, and infer rules or decision procedures, which are then used to drive business decisions.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 107pt;text-indent: 11pt;text-align: justify;">For example, banks need to decide whether to give a loan to a loan applicant, online advertisers need to decide which advertisement to show to a particular user. These tasks are addressed in two steps. First, data-analysis techniques attempt to automatically discover rules and patterns from data and create <i>predictive models</i>. These models take as input attributes (“features”) of individuals, and output pre-</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 139pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark10">dictions such as likelihood of paying back a loan, or clicking on an advertisement, which are then used to make the business decision.</a><a name="bookmark22">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="padding-left: 139pt;text-indent: 11pt;text-align: justify;">As another example, manufacturers and retailers need to make decisions on what items to manufacture or order in what quantities; these decisions are driven signiﬁcantly by techniques for analyzing past data, and predicting trends. The cost of making wrong decisions can be very high, and organizations are therefore willing to invest a lot of money to gather or purchase required data, and build systems that can use the data to make accurate predictions.</p><p style="padding-left: 139pt;text-indent: 11pt;text-align: justify;">The ﬁeld of <i>data mining </i>combines knowledge-discovery techniques invented by artiﬁcial intelligence researchers and statistical analysts with eﬃcient implemen- tation techniques that enable them to be used on extremely large databases.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part51.htm">&lt; 上一个</a><span> | </span><a href="../database.html">内容</a><span> | </span><a href="part53.htm">下一个 &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
