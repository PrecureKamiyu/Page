<h2 class="h20"><a id="a1995"></a>SCENE VI.</h2>
<p class="p10">MAHOMET, MUSTAPHA.</p>
<p class="p26">MAHOMET.<br/>Now, Mustapha, pursue thy tale of horrour.<br/>Has treason&rsquo;s dire infection reach&rsquo;d my palace?<br/>Can Cali dare the stroke of heav&rsquo;nly justice,<br/>In the dark precincts of the gaping grave,<br/>And load with perjuries his parting soul?<br/>Was it for this, that, sick&rsquo;ning in Epirus,<br/>My father call&rsquo;d me to his couch of death,<br/>Join&rsquo;d Cali&rsquo;s hand to mine, and falt&rsquo;ring cried,<br/>Restrain the fervour of impetuous youth<br/>With venerable Cali&rsquo;s faithful counsels?<br/>Are these the counsels, this the faith of Cali?<br/>Were all our favours lavish&rsquo;d on a villain?<br/>Confest? &mdash; </p>
<p class="p26">MUSTAPHA.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Confest by dying Menodorus.<br/>In his last agonies, the gasping coward,<br/>Amidst the tortures of the burning steel,<br/>Still fond of life, groan&rsquo;d out the dreadful secret,<br/>Held forth this fatal scroll, then sunk to nothing.</p>
<p class="p26">MAHOMET. <span class="t8">examining the paper</span>.<br/>His correspondence with our foes of Greece!<br/>His hand! his seal! The secrets of my soul,<br/>Conceal&rsquo;d from all but him! All, all conspire<br/>To banish doubt, and brand him for a villain!<br/>Our schemes for ever cross&rsquo;d, our mines discover&rsquo;d,<br/>Betray&rsquo;d some traitor lurking near my bosom.<br/>Oft have I rag&rsquo;d, when their wide-wasting cannon<br/>Lay pointed at our batt&rsquo;ries yet unform&rsquo;d,<br/>And broke the meditated lines of war.<br/>Detested Cali, too, with artful wonder,<br/>Would shake his wily head, and closely whisper,<br/>Beware of Mustapha, beware of treason.</p>
<p class="p26">MUSTAPHA.<br/>The faith of Mustapha disdains suspicion;<br/>But yet, great emperour, beware of treason;<br/>Th&rsquo; insidious bassa, fir&rsquo;d by disappointment &mdash; </p>
<p class="p26">MAHOMET.<br/>Shall feel the vengeance of an injur&rsquo;d king.<br/>Go, seize him, load him with reproachful chains;<br/>Before th&rsquo; assembled troops, proclaim his crimes;<br/>Then leave him, stretch&rsquo;d upon the ling&rsquo;ring rack,<br/>Amidst the camp to howl his life away.</p>
<p class="p26">MUSTAPHA.<br/>Should we, before the troops, proclaim his crimes,<br/>I dread his arts of seeming innocence,<br/>His bland address, and sorcery of tongue;<br/>And, should he fall, unheard, by sudden justice,<br/>Th&rsquo; adoring soldiers would revenge their idol.</p>
<p class="p26">MAHOMET.<br/>Cali, this day, with hypocritick zeal,<br/>Implor&rsquo;d my leave to visit Mecca&rsquo;s temple;<br/>Struck with the wonder of a statesman&rsquo;s goodness,<br/>I rais&rsquo;d his thoughts to more sublime devotion.<br/>Now let him go, pursu&rsquo;d by silent wrath,<br/>Meet unexpected daggers in his way,<br/>And, in some distant land, obscurely die.</p>
<p class="p26">MUSTAPHA.<br/>There will his boundless wealth, the spoil of Asia,<br/>Heap&rsquo;d by your father&rsquo;s ill-plac&rsquo;d bounties on him,<br/>Disperse rebellion through the eastern world;<br/>Bribe to his cause, and list beneath his banners,<br/>Arabia&rsquo;s roving troops, the sons of swiftness,<br/>And arm the Persian heretick against thee;<br/>There shall he waste thy frontiers, check thy conquests,<br/>And, though at length subdued, elude thy vengeance.</p>
<p class="p26">MAHOMET.<br/>Elude my vengeance! No &mdash; My troops shall range<br/>Th&rsquo; eternal snows that freeze beyond Maeotis,<br/>And Africk&rsquo;s torrid sands, in search of Cali.<br/>Should the fierce north, upon his frozen wings,<br/>Bear him aloft, above the wond&rsquo;ring clouds,<br/>And seat him in the pleiads&rsquo; golden chariots,<br/>Thence shall my fury drag him down to tortures;<br/>Wherever guilt can fly, revenge can follow.</p>
<p class="p26">MUSTAPHA.<br/>Wilt thou dismiss the savage from the toils,<br/>Only to hunt him round the ravag&rsquo;d world?</p>
<p class="p26">MAHOMET.<br/>Suspend his sentence &mdash; Empire and Irene<br/>Claim my divided soul. This wretch, unworthy<br/>To mix with nobler cares, I&rsquo;ll throw aside<br/>For idle hours, and crush him at my leisure.</p>
<p class="p26">MUSTAPHA.<br/>Let not th&rsquo; unbounded greatness of his mind<br/>Betray my king to negligence of danger.<br/>Perhaps, the clouds of dark conspiracy<br/>Now roll, full fraught with thunder, o&rsquo;er your head.<br/>Twice, since the morning rose, I saw the bassa,<br/>Like a fell adder swelling in a brake,<br/>Beneath the covert of this verdant arch,<br/>In private conference; beside him stood<br/>Two men unknown, the partners of his bosom;<br/>I mark&rsquo;d them well, and trac&rsquo;d in either face<br/>The gloomy resolution, horrid greatness,<br/>And stern composure, of despairing heroes;<br/>And, to confirm my thoughts, at sight of me,<br/>As blasted by my presence, they withdrew,<br/>With all the speed of terrour and of guilt.</p>
<p class="p26">MAHOMET.<br/>The strong emotions of my troubled soul<br/>Allow no pause for art or for contrivance;<br/>And dark perplexity distracts my counsels.<br/>Do thou resolve: for, see, Irene comes!<br/>At her approach each ruder gust of thought<br/>Sinks, like the sighing of a tempest spent,<br/>And gales of softer passion fan my bosom.<br/>[Cali <span class="t8">enters with</span> Irene, <span class="t8">and exit [Transcriber&rsquo;s note: sic] with</span><br/>Mustapha.</p>
