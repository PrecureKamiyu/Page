<p class="p26">&nbsp;&mdash; Quis ineptae<br/>Tam patiens urbis, tam ferreus ut teneat se? JUV.</p>
<p class="p26">Though grief and fondness in my breast rebel,<br/>When injur&rsquo;d Thales bids the town farewell,<br/>Yet still my calmer thoughts his choice commend,<br/>I praise the hermit, but regret the friend;<br/>Resolv&rsquo;d at length, from vice and London far,<br/>To breathe, in distant fields, a purer air,<br/>And, fix&rsquo;d on Cambria&rsquo;s solitary shore,<br/>Give to St. David one true Briton more.<br/>For who would leave, unbrib&rsquo;d, Hibernia&rsquo;s land,<br/>Or change the rocks of Scotland for the Strand?<br/>There none are swept by sudden fate away,<br/>But all, whom hunger spares, with age decay:<br/>Here malice, rapine, accident, conspire,<br/>And now a rabble rages, now a fire;<br/>Their ambush here relentless ruffians lay,<br/>And here the fell attorney prowls for prey;<br/>Here falling houses thunder on your head,<br/>And here a female atheist talks you dead.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While Thales waits the wherry, that contains<br/>Of dissipated wealth the small remains,<br/>On Thames&rsquo;s banks, in silent thought, we stood<br/>Where Greenwich smiles upon the silver flood;<br/>Struck with the seat that gave Eliza birth,<br/>We kneel, and kiss the consecrated earth;<br/>In pleasing dreams the blissful age renew,<br/>And call Britannia&rsquo;s glories back to view;<br/>Behold her cross triumphant on the main,<br/>The guard of commerce, and the dread of Spain,<br/>Ere masquerades debauch&rsquo;d, excise oppress&rsquo;d<br/>Or English honour grew a standing jest.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A transient calm the happy scenes bestow,<br/>And, for a moment, lull the sense of woe.<br/>At length awaking, with contemptuous frown,<br/>Indignant Thales eyes the neighb&rsquo;ring town.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since worth, he cries, in these degen&rsquo;rate days,<br/>Wants ev&rsquo;n the cheap reward of empty praise;<br/>In those curs&rsquo;d walls, devote to vice and gain,<br/>Since unrewarded science toils in vain;<br/>Since hope but sooths to double my distress,<br/>And ev&rsquo;ry moment leaves my little less;<br/>While yet my steady steps no staff sustains,<br/>And life, still vig&rsquo;rous, revels in my veins;<br/>Grant me, kind heaven, to find some happier place,<br/>Where honesty and sense are no disgrace;<br/>Some pleasing bank where verdant osiers play,<br/>Some peaceful vale, with nature&rsquo;s paintings gay;<br/>Where once the harass&rsquo;d Briton found repose,<br/>And, safe in poverty, defied his foes;<br/>Some secret cell, ye pow&rsquo;rs, indulgent give,<br/>Let &mdash; live here, for &mdash; has learn&rsquo;d to live.<br/>Here let those reign, whom pensions can incite<br/>To vote a patriot black, a courtier white;<br/>Explain their country&rsquo;s dear-bought rights away,<br/>And plead for pirates in the face of day;<br/>With slavish tenets taint our poison&rsquo;d youth,<br/>And lend a lie the confidence of truth.<br/>Let such raise palaces, and manors buy,<br/>Collect a tax, or farm a lottery;<br/>With warbling eunuchs fill a licens&rsquo;d stage,<br/>And lull to servitude a thoughtless age.<br/>Heroes, proceed! what bounds your pride shall hold,<br/>What check restrain your thirst of pow&rsquo;r and gold?<br/>Behold rebellious virtue quite o&rsquo;erthrown,<br/>Behold our fame, our wealth, our lives, your own.<br/>To such the plunder of a land is giv&rsquo;n,<br/>When publick crimes inflame the wrath of heaven:<br/>But what, my friend, what hope remains for me.<br/>Who start at theft, and blush at perjury?<br/>Who scarce forbear, though Britain&rsquo;s court he sing,<br/>To pluck a titled poet&rsquo;s borrow&rsquo;d wing;<br/>A statesman&rsquo;s logick unconvinc&rsquo;d can hear.<br/>And dare to slumber o&rsquo;er the Gazetteer;<br/>Despise a fool in half his pension dress&rsquo;d,<br/>And strive, in vain, to laugh at Clodio&rsquo;s jest.<br/>Others, with softer smiles, and subtler art,<br/>Can sap the principles, or taint the heart;<br/>With more address a lover&rsquo;s note convey,<br/>Or bribe a virgin&rsquo;s innocence away.<br/>Well may they rise, while I, whose rustick tongue<br/>Ne&rsquo;er knew to puzzle right, or varnish wrong,<br/>Spurn&rsquo;d as a beggar, dreaded as a spy,<br/>Live unregarded, unlamented die.<br/>For what but social guilt the friend endears?<br/>Who shares Orgilio&rsquo;s crimes, his fortune shares.<br/>But thou, should tempting villany present<br/>All Marlb&rsquo;rough hoarded, or all Villiers spent,<br/>Turn from the glitt&rsquo;ring bribe thy scornful eye,<br/>Nor sell for gold, what gold could never buy,<br/>The peaceful slumber, self-approving day,<br/>Unsullied fame, and conscience ever gay.<br/>&nbsp;The cheated nation&rsquo;s happy fav&rsquo;rites, see!<br/>Mark whom the great caress, who frown on me!<br/>London! the needy villain&rsquo;s gen&rsquo;ral home,<br/>The common sewer of Paris and of Rome;<br/>With eager thirst, by folly or by fate,<br/>Sucks in the dregs of each corrupted state.<br/>Forgive my transports, on a theme like this,<br/>I cannot bear a French metropolis.<br/>Illustrious Edward! from the realms of day,<br/>The land of heroes and of saints survey;<br/>Nor hope the British lineaments to trace,<br/>The rustick grandeur, or the surly grace;<br/>But, lost in thoughtless ease and empty show,<br/>Behold the warriour dwindled to a beau;<br/>Sense, freedom, piety, refin&rsquo;d away,<br/>Of France the mimick, and of Spain the prey.<br/>All that at home no more can beg or steal,<br/>Or like a gibbet better than a wheel;<br/>Hiss&rsquo;d from the stage, or hooted from the court,<br/>Their air, their dress, their politicks, import;<br/>Obsequious, artful, voluble and gay,<br/>On Britain&rsquo;s fond credulity they prey.<br/>No gainful trade their industry can &lsquo;scape,<br/>They sing, they dance, clean shoes, or cure a clap:<br/>All sciences a fasting Monsieur knows,<br/>And, bid him go to hell, to hell he goes.<br/>Ah! what avails it, that, from slav&rsquo;ry far,<br/>I drew the breath of life in English air;<br/>Was early taught a Briton&rsquo;s right to prize,<br/>And lisp the tale of Henry&rsquo;s victories;<br/>If the gull&rsquo;d conqueror receives the chain,<br/>And flattery prevails, when arms are vain!<br/>Studious to please, and ready to submit,<br/>The supple Gaul was born a parasite:<br/>Still to his int&rsquo;rest true, where&rsquo;er he goes,<br/>Wit, brav&rsquo;ry, worth, his lavish tongue bestows;<br/>In ev&rsquo;ry face a thousand graces shine,<br/>From ev&rsquo;ry tongue flows harmony divine.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;These arts in vain our rugged natives try,<br/>Strain out, with fault&rsquo;ring diffidence, a lie,<br/>And get a kick for awkward flattery.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides, with justice, this discerning age<br/>Admires their wondrous talents for the stage:<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Well may they venture on the mimick&rsquo;s art,<br/>Who play from morn to night a borrow&rsquo;d part;<br/>Practis&rsquo;d their master&rsquo;s notions to embrace,<br/>Repeat his maxims, and reflect his face;<br/>With ev&rsquo;ry wild absurdity comply,<br/>And view each object with another&rsquo;s eye;<br/>To shake with laughter, ere the jest they hear,<br/>To pour at will the counterfeited tear;<br/>And, as their patron hints the cold or heat.<br/>To shake in dog-days, in December sweat.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;How, when competitors, like these, contend,<br/>Can surly virtue hope to fix a friend?<br/>Slaves that with serious impudence beguile,<br/>And lie without a blush, without a smile;<br/>Exalt each trifle, ev&rsquo;ry vice adore,<br/>Your taste in snuff, your judgment in a whore:<br/>Can Balbo&rsquo;s eloquence applaud, and swear,<br/>He gropes his breeches with a monarch&rsquo;s air.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;For arts, like these, preferr&rsquo;d, admir&rsquo;d, caress&rsquo;d,<br/>They first invade your table, then your breast;<br/>Explore your secrets with insidious art,<br/>Watch the weak hour, and ransack all the heart;<br/>Then soon your ill-placed confidence repay,<br/>Commence your lords, and govern or betray.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;By numbers here from shame or censure free,<br/>All crimes are safe, but hated poverty.<br/>This, only this, the rigid law pursues,<br/>This, only this, provokes the snarling muse.<br/>The sober trader at a tatter&rsquo;d cloak<br/>Wakes from his dream, and labours for a joke;<br/>With brisker air the silken courtiers gaze,<br/>And turn the varied taunt a thousand ways.<br/>Of all the griefs, that harass the distress&rsquo;d,<br/>Sure the most bitter is a scornful jest;<br/>Fate never wounds more deep the gen&rsquo;rous heart,<br/>Than when a blockhead&rsquo;s insult points the dart.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Has heaven reserv&rsquo;d, in pity to the poor,<br/>No pathless waste, or undiscover&rsquo;d shore?<br/>No secret island in the boundless main?<br/>No peaceful desert, yet unclaim&rsquo;d by Spain?<br/>Quick let us rise, the happy seats explore,<br/>And bear oppression&rsquo;s insolence no more.<br/>This mournful truth is ev&rsquo;ry where confess&rsquo;d,<br/>SLOW RISES WORTH, BY POVERTY DEPRESS&rsquo;D:<br/>But here more slow, where all are slaves to gold,<br/>Where looks are merchandise, and smiles are sold;<br/>Where won by bribes, by flatteries implor&rsquo;d,<br/>The groom retails the favours of his lord.<br/>But hark! th&rsquo; affrighted crowd&rsquo;s tumultuous cries<br/>Roll through the streets, and thunder to the skies:<br/>Rais&rsquo;d from some pleasing dream of wealth and pow&rsquo;r,<br/>Some pompous palace, or some blissful bow&rsquo;r,<br/>Aghast you start, and scarce, with aching sight,<br/>Sustain th&rsquo; approaching fire&rsquo;s tremendous light;<br/>Swift from pursuing horrours take your way,<br/>And leave your little ALL to flames a prey;<br/>Then through the world a wretched vagrant roam;<br/>For where can starving merit find a home?<br/>In vain your mournful narrative disclose,<br/>While all neglect, and most insult your woes.<br/>Should heav&rsquo;n&rsquo;s just bolts Orgilio&rsquo;s wealth confound,<br/>And spread his flaming palace on the ground,<br/>Swift o&rsquo;er the land the dismal rumour flies,<br/>And publick mournings pacify the skies;<br/>The laureate tribe in venal verse relate,<br/>How virtue wars with persecuting fate;<br/>With well-feign&rsquo;d gratitude the pension&rsquo;d band<br/>Refund the plunder of the beggar&rsquo;d land.<br/>See! while he builds, the gaudy vassals come,<br/>And crowd with sudden wealth the rising dome;<br/>The price of boroughs and of souls restore;<br/>And raise his treasures higher than before.<br/>Now bless&rsquo;d with all the baubles of the great,<br/>The polish&rsquo;d marble and the shining plate,<br/>Orgilio sees the golden pile aspire,<br/>And hopes from angry heav&rsquo;n another fire.<br/>Could&rsquo;st thou resign the park and play, content,<br/>For the fair banks of Severn or of Trent;<br/>There might&rsquo;st thou find some elegant retreat,<br/>Some hireling senator&rsquo;s deserted seat;<br/>And stretch thy prospects o&rsquo;er the smiling land,<br/>For less than rent the dungeons of the Strand;<br/>There prune thy walks, support thy drooping flowers,<br/>Direct thy rivulets, and twine thy bowers;<br/>&nbsp;And, while thy grounds a cheap repast afford,<br/>Despise the dainties of a venal lord:<br/>There ev&rsquo;ry bush with nature&rsquo;s musick rings;<br/>There ev&rsquo;ry breeze bears health upon its wings;<br/>On all thy hours security shall smile,<br/>And bless thine evening walk and morning toil.<br/>Prepare for death, if here at night you roam,<br/>And sign your will, before you sup from home.<br/>&nbsp;Some fiery fop, with new commission vain,<br/>Who sleeps on brambles, till he kills his man;<br/>Some frolick drunkard, reeling from a feast,<br/>Provokes a broil, and stabs you for a jest.<br/>Yet e&rsquo;en these heroes, mischievously gay,<br/>Lords of the street, and terrours of the way;<br/>Flush&rsquo;d, as they are, with folly, youth, and wine;<br/>Their prudent insults to the poor confine;<br/>Afar they mark the flambeau&rsquo;s bright approach,<br/>And shun the shining train, and golden coach.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;In vain, these dangers past, your doors you close,<br/>And hope the balmy blessings of repose;<br/>Cruel with guilt, and daring with despair,<br/>The midnight murd&rsquo;rer bursts the faithless bar;<br/>Invades the sacred hour of silent rest,<br/>And leaves, unseen, a dagger in your breast.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Scarce can our fields, such crowds at Tyburn die,<br/>With hemp the gallows and the fleet supply.<br/>Propose your schemes, ye senatorian band,<br/>Whose ways and meanssupport the sinking land:<br/>Lest ropes be wanting in the tempting spring,<br/>To rig another convoy for the king.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;A single gaol, in Alfred&rsquo;s golden reign,<br/>Could half the nation&rsquo;s criminals contain;<br/>Fair justice, then, without constraint ador&rsquo;d,<br/>Held high the steady scale, but sheath&rsquo;d the sword ;<br/>No spies were paid, no special juries known,<br/>Blest age! but ah! how different from our own!<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Much could I add, &mdash; but see the boat at hand,<br/>The tide, retiring, calls me from the land:<br/>&nbsp;Farewell! &mdash; When youth, and health, and fortune spent,<br/>Thou fly&rsquo;st for refuge to the wilds of Kent;<br/>And, tir&rsquo;d, like me, with follies and with crimes,<br/>In angry numbers warn&rsquo;st succeeding times;<br/>Then shall thy friend, nor thou refuse his aid,<br/>Still foe to vice, forsake his Cambrian shade;<br/>In virtue&rsquo;s cause, once more, exert his rage,<br/>Thy satire point, and animate thy page.</p>
