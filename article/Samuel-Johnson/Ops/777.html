<h2 class="h20"><a id="a1906"></a>MACBETH.</h2>
<p class="p21">This play is deservedly celebrated for the propriety of its fictions, and solemnity, grandeur, and variety of its action; but it has no nice discriminations of character; the events are too great to admit the influence of particular dispositions, and the course of the action necessarily determines the conduct of the agents.</p>
<p class="p24">The danger of ambition is well described; and I know not whether it may not be said, in defence of some parts which now seem improbable, that, in Shakespeare&rsquo;s time, it was necessary to warn credulity against vain and illusive predictions.</p>
<p class="p24">The passions are directed to their true end. Lady Macbeth is merely detested; and though the courage of Macbeth preserves some esteem, yet every reader rejoices at his fall.</p>
