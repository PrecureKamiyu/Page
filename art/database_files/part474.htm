Tools exist also to join mining pools. Browsing tools exist to view the contents of public blockchains. For some blockchains, notably Ethereum, it is possible to install a private copy of the blockchain software managing a private blockchain as an educational tool. Ethereum also oﬀers a public test network where smart contracts can be debugged without the expense of gas on the real network.</p><p style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">Hyperledger (<span class="s49">www.hyperledger.org</span>) which is supported by a large consortium of companies, provides a wide variety of open source blockchain platforms and tools. Corda (<span class="s49">www.corda.net</span>) and BigchainDB (<span class="s49">www.bigchaindb.com</span>) are two other blockchain platforms, with BigchainDB having a speciﬁc focus on blockchain databases.</p><p style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">Blockchain based systems for supporting academic certiﬁcates and medical records, such as Blockcert and Medrec (both from MIT), and several other applica- tions are available online. The set of tools for blockchain are evolving rapidly. Due to the rapid rate of change and development, as of late 2018 we are unable to identify a best set of tools, beyond the few mentioned above, that we can recommend. We recom- mend you perform a web search for the latest tools.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part473.htm">&lt; 上一个</a><span> | </span><a href="../database.html">内容</a><span> | </span><a href="part475.htm">下一个 &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
