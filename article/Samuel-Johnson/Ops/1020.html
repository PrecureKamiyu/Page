<p class="p24">&lsquo;The misfortune of Goldsmith in conversation is this: he goes on without knowing how he is to get off. His genius is great, but his knowledge is small. As they say of a generous man, it is a pity he is not rich, we may say of Goldsmith, it is a pity he is not knowing. He would not keep his knowledge to himself.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">1773: AETAT. 64.] &mdash; In 1773 his only publication was an edition of his folio Dictionary, with additions and corrections; nor did he, so far as is known, furnish any productions of his fertile pen to any of his numerous friends or dependants, except the Preface to his old amanuensis Macbean&rsquo;s Dictionary of Ancient Geography.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;TO JAMES BOSWELL, ESQ.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;DEAR SIR, &mdash; . . . A new edition of my great Dictionary is printed, from a copy which I was persuaded to revise; but having made no preparation, I was able to do very little. Some superfluities I have expunged, and some faults I have corrected, and here and there have scattered a remark; but the main fabrick of the work remains as it was. I had looked very little into it since I wrote it, and, I think, I found it full as often better, as worse, than I expected.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Baretti and Davies have had a furious quarrel; a quarrel, I think, irreconcileable. Dr. Goldsmith has a new comedy, which is expected in the spring. No name is yet given it. The chief diversion arises from a stratagem by which a lover is made to mistake his future father-in-law&rsquo;s house for an inn. This, you see, borders upon farce. The dialogue is quick and gay, and the incidents are so prepared as not to seem improbable. . . .</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;My health seems in general to improve; but I have been troubled for many weeks with a vexatious catarrh, which is sometimes sufficiently distressful. I have not found any great effects from bleeding and physick; and am afraid, that I must expect help from brighter days and softer air.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Write to me now and then; and whenever any good befalls you, make haste to let me know it, for no one will rejoice at it more than, dear Sir, your most humble servant,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;London, Feb. 24, 1773.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;You continue to stand very high in the favour of Mrs. Thrale.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">While a former edition of my work was passing through the press, I was unexpectedly favoured with a packet from Philadelphia, from Mr. James Abercrombie, a gentleman of that country, who is pleased to honour me with very high praise of my Life of Dr. Johnson. To have the fame of my illustrious friend, and his faithful biographer, echoed from the New World is extremely flattering; and my grateful acknowledgements shall be wafted across the Atlantick. Mr. Abercrombie has politely conferred on me a considerable additional obligation, by transmitting to me copies of two letters from Dr. Johnson to American gentlemen.</p>
<p class="p24">On Saturday, April 3, the day after my arrival in London this year, I went to his house late in the evening, and sat with Mrs. Williams till he came home. I found in the London Chronicle, Dr. Goldsmith&rsquo;s apology to the publick for beating Evans, a bookseller, on account of a paragraph in a newspaper published by him, which Goldsmith thought impertinent to him and to a lady of his acquaintance. The apology was written so much in Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s manner, that both Mrs. Williams and I supposed it to be his; but when he came home, he soon undeceived us. When he said to Mrs. Williams, &lsquo;Well, Dr. Goldsmith&rsquo;s manifesto has got into your paper;&rsquo; I asked him if Dr. Goldsmith had written it, with an air that made him see I suspected it was his, though subscribed by Goldsmith. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, Dr. Goldsmith would no more have asked me to write such a thing as that for him, than he would have asked me to feed him with a spoon, or to do anything else that denoted his imbecility. I as much believe that he wrote it, as if I had seen him do it. Sir, had he shewn it to any one friend, he would not have been allowed to publish it. He has, indeed, done it very well; but it is a foolish thing well done. I suppose he has been so much elated with the success of his new comedy, that he has thought every thing that concerned him must be of importance to the publick.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;I fancy, Sir, this is the first time that he has been engaged in such an adventure.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, I believe it is the first time he has BEAT; he may have BEEN BEATEN before. This, Sir, is a new plume to him.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">At Mr. Thrale&rsquo;s, in the evening, he repeated his usual paradoxical declamation against action in publick speaking. &lsquo;Action can have no effect upon reasonable minds. It may augment noise, but it never can enforce argument.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Lord Chesterfield being mentioned, Johnson remarked, that almost all of that celebrated nobleman&rsquo;s witty sayings were puns. He, however, allowed the merit of good wit to his Lordship&rsquo;s saying of Lord Tyrawley and himself, when both very old and infirm: &lsquo;Tyrawley and I have been dead these two years; but we don&rsquo;t choose to have it known.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">The conversation having turned on modern imitations of ancient ballads, and some one having praised their simplicity, he treated them with that ridicule which he always displayed when that subject was mentioned.</p>
<p class="p24">He disapproved of introducing scripture phrases into secular discourse. This seemed to me a question of some difficulty. A scripture expression may be used, like a highly classical phrase, to produce an instantaneous strong impression; and it may be done without being at all improper. Yet I own there is danger, that applying the language of our sacred book to ordinary subjects may tend to lessen our reverence for it. If therefore it be introduced at all, it should be with very great caution.</p>
<p class="p24">On Thursday, April 8, I sat a good part of the evening with him, but he was very silent.</p>
<p class="p24">Though he was not disposed to talk, he was unwilling that I should leave him; and when I looked at my watch, and told him it was twelve o&rsquo;clock, he cried, What&rsquo;s that to you and me?&rsquo; and ordered Frank to tell Mrs. Williams that we were coming to drink tea with her, which we did. It was settled that we should go to church together next day.</p>
<p class="p24">On the 9th of April, being Good Friday, I breakfasted with him on tea and cross-buns; DOCTOR Levet, as Frank called him, making the tea. He carried me with him to the church of St. Clement Danes, where he had his seat; and his behaviour was, as I had imaged to myself, solemnly devout. I never shall forget the tremulous earnestness with which he pronounced the awful petition in the Litany: &lsquo;In the hour of death, and at the day of judgement, good LORD deliver us.</p>
<p class="p24">We went to church both in the morning and evening. In the interval between the two services we did not dine; but he read in the Greek New Testament, and I turned over several of his books.</p>
<p class="p24">I told him that Goldsmith had said to me a few days before, &lsquo;As I take my shoes from the shoemaker, and my coat from the taylor, so I take my religion from the priest.&rsquo; I regretted this loose way of talking. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, he knows nothing; he has made up his mind about nothing.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">To my great surprize he asked me to dine with him on Easter-day. I never supposed that he had a dinner at his house; for I had not then heard of any one of his friends having been entertained at his table. He told me, &lsquo;I generally have a meat pye on Sunday: it is baked at a publick oven, which is very properly allowed, because one man can attend it; and thus the advantage is obtained of not keeping servants from church to dress dinners.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">April 11, being Easter-Sunday, after having attended Divine Service at St. Paul&rsquo;s, I repaired to Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s. I had gratified my curiosity much in dining with JEAN JAQUES ROUSSEAU, while he lived in the wilds of Neufchatel: I had as great a curiosity to dine with DR. SAMUEL JOHNSON, in the dusky recess of a court in Fleet-street. I supposed we should scarcely have knives and forks, and only some strange, uncouth, ill-drest dish: but I found every thing in very good order. We had no other company but Mrs. Williams and a young woman whom I did not know. As a dinner here was considered as a singular phaenomenon, and as I was frequently interrogated on the subject, my readers may perhaps be desirous to know our bill of fare. Foote, I remember, in allusion to Francis, the NEGRO, was willing to suppose that our repast was BLACK BROTH. But the fact was, that we had a very good soup, a boiled leg of lamb and spinach, a veal pye, and a rice pudding.</p>
<p class="p24">He owned that he thought Hawkesworth was one of his imitators, but he did not think Goldsmith was. Goldsmith, he said, had great merit. BOSWELL. &lsquo;But, Sir, he is much indebted to you for his getting so high in the publick estimation.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, he has perhaps got SOONER to it by his intimacy with me.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Goldsmith, though his vanity often excited him to occasional competition, had a very high regard for Johnson, which he at this time expressed in the strongest manner in the Dedication of his comedy, entitled, She Stoops to Conquer.</p>
<p class="p24">He told me that he had twelve or fourteen times attempted to keep a journal of his life, but never could persevere. He advised me to do it. &lsquo;The great thing to be recorded, (said he,) is the state of your own mind; and you should write down every thing that you remember, for you cannot judge at first what is good or bad; and write immediately while the impression is fresh, for it will not be the same a week afterwards.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I again solicited him to communicate to me the particulars of his early life. He said, &lsquo;You shall have them all for two-pence. I hope you shall know a great deal more of me before you write my Life.&rsquo; He mentioned to me this day many circumstances, which I wrote down when I went home, and have interwoven in the former part of this narrative.</p>
<p class="p24">On Tuesday, April 13, he and Dr. Goldsmith and I dined at General Oglethorpe&rsquo;s. Goldsmith expatiated on the common topick, that the race of our people was degenerated, and that this was owing to luxury. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, in the first place, I doubt the fact. I believe there are as many tall men in England now, as ever there were. But, secondly, supposing the stature of our people to be diminished, that is not owing to luxury; for, Sir, consider to how very small a proportion of our people luxury can reach. Our soldiery, surely, are not luxurious, who live on sixpence a day; and the same remark will apply to almost all the other classes. Luxury, so far as it reaches the poor, will do good to the race of people; it will strengthen and multiply them. Sir, no nation was ever hurt by luxury; for, as I said before, it can reach but to a very few. I admit that the great increase of commerce and manufactures hurts the military spirit of a people; because it produces a competition for something else than martial honours, &mdash; a competition for riches. It also hurts the bodies of the people; for you will observe, there is no man who works at any particular trade, but you may know him from his appearance to do so. One part or other of his body being more used than the rest, he is in some degree deformed: but, Sir, that is not luxury. A tailor sits cross-legged; but that is not luxury.&rsquo; GOLDSMITH. &lsquo;Come, you&rsquo;re just going to the same place by another road.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Nay, Sir, I say that is not LUXURY. Let us take a walk from Charing-cross to White-chapel, through, I suppose, the greatest series of shops in the world; what is there in any of these shops (if you except gin-shops,) that can do any human being any harm?&rsquo; GOLDSMITH. &lsquo;Well, Sir, I&rsquo;ll accept your challenge. The very next shop to Northumberland-house is a pickle-shop.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Well, Sir: do we not know that a maid can in one afternoon make pickles sufficient to serve a whole family for a year? nay, that five pickle-shops can serve all the kingdom? Besides, Sir, there is no harm done to any body by the making of pickles, or the eating of pickles.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">We drank tea with the ladies; and Goldsmith sung Tony Lumpkin&rsquo;s song in his comedy, She Stoops to Conquer, and a very pretty one, to an Irish tune, which he had designed for Miss Hardcastle; but as Mrs. Bulkeley, who played the part, could not sing, it was left out. He afterwards wrote it down for me, by which means it was preserved, and now appears amongst his poems. Dr. Johnson, in his way home, stopped at my lodgings in Piccadilly, and sat with me, drinking tea a second time, till a late hour.</p>
<p class="p24">I told him that Mrs. Macaulay said, she wondered how he could reconcile his political principles with his moral; his notions of inequality and subordination with wishing well to the happiness of all mankind, who might live so agreeably, had they all their portions of land, and none to domineer over another. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, I reconcile my principles very well, because mankind are happier in a state of inequality and subordination. Were they to be in this pretty state of equality, they would soon degenerate into brutes; &mdash; they would become Monboddo&rsquo;s nation; &mdash; their tails would grow. Sir, all would be losers were all to work for all &mdash; they would have no intellectual improvement. All intellectual improvement arises from leisure; all leisure arises from one working for another.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Talking of the family of Stuart, he said, &lsquo;It should seem that the family at present on the throne has now established as good a right as the former family, by the long consent of the people; and that to disturb this right might be considered as culpable. At the same time I own, that it is a very difficult question, when considered with respect to the house of Stuart. To oblige people to take oaths as to the disputed right, is wrong. I know not whether I could take them: but I do not blame those who do.&rsquo; So conscientious and so delicate was he upon this subject, which has occasioned so much clamour against him.</p>
<p class="p24">On Thursday, April 15, I dined with him and Dr. Goldsmith at General Paoli&rsquo;s.</p>
<p class="p24">I spoke of Allan Ramsay&rsquo;s Gentle Shepherd, in the Scottish dialect, as the best pastoral that had ever been written; not only abounding with beautiful rural imagery, and just and pleasing sentiments, but being a real picture of manners; and I offered to teach Dr. Johnson to understand it. &lsquo;No, Sir, (said he,) I won&rsquo;t learn it. You shall retain your superiority by my not knowing it.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">It having been observed that there was little hospitality in London; &mdash; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Nay, Sir, any man who has a name, or who has the power of pleasing, will be very generally invited in London. The man, Sterne, I have been told, has had engagements for three months.&rsquo; GOLDSMITH. &lsquo;And a very dull fellow.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, no, Sir.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Martinelli told us, that for several years he lived much with Charles Townshend, and that he ventured to tell him he was a bad joker. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, thus much I can say upon the subject. One day he and a few more agreed to go and dine in the country, and each of them was to bring a friend in his carriage with him. Charles Townshend asked Fitzherbert to go with him, but told him, &ldquo;You must find somebody to bring you back: I can only carry you there.&rdquo; Fitzherbert did not much like this arrangement. He however consented, observing sarcastically, &ldquo;It will do very well; for then the same jokes will serve you in returning as in going.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">An eminent publick character being mentioned; &mdash; JOHNSON. &lsquo;I remember being present when he shewed himself to be so corrupted, or at least something so different from what I think right, as to maintain, that a member of parliament should go along with his party right or wrong. Now, Sir, this is so remote from native virtue, from scholastick virtue, that a good man must have undergone a great change before he can reconcile himself to such a doctrine. It is maintaining that you may lie to the publick; for you lie when you call that right which you think wrong, or the reverse. A friend of ours, who is too much an echo of that gentleman, observed, that a man who does not stick uniformly to a party, is only waiting to be bought. Why then, said I, he is only waiting to be what that gentleman is already.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">We talked of the King&rsquo;s coming to see Goldsmith&rsquo;s new play.&mdash; &lsquo;I wish he would,&rsquo; said Goldsmith; adding, however, with an affected indifference, &lsquo;Not that it would do me the least good.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Well then, Sir, let us say it would do HIM good, (laughing.) No, Sir, this affectation will not pass; &mdash; it is mighty idle. In such a state as ours, who would not wish to please the Chief Magistrate?&rsquo; GOLDSMITH. &lsquo;I DO wish to please him. I remember a line in Dryden, &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;And every poet is the monarch&rsquo;s friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">It ought to be reversed.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Nay, there are finer lines in Dryden on this subject: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;For colleges on bounteous Kings depend,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And never rebel was to arts a friend.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">General Paoli observed, that &lsquo;successful rebels might.&rsquo; MARTINELLI. &lsquo;Happy rebellions.&rsquo; GOLDSMITH. &lsquo;We have no such phrase.&rsquo; GENERAL PAOLI. &lsquo;But have you not the THING?&rsquo; GOLDSMITH. &lsquo;Yes; all our HAPPY revolutions. They have hurt our constitution, and will hurt it, till we mend it by another HAPPY REVOLUTION.&rsquo; I never before discovered that my friend Goldsmith had so much of the old prejudice in him.</p>
<p class="p24">General Paoli, talking of Goldsmith&rsquo;s new play, said, &lsquo;Il a fait un compliment tres gracieux a une certaine grande dame;&rsquo; meaning a Duchess of the first rank.</p>
<p class="p24">I expressed a doubt whether Goldsmith intended it, in order that I might hear the truth from himself. It, perhaps, was not quite fair to endeavour to bring him to a confession, as he might not wish to avow positively his taking part against the Court. He smiled and hesitated. The General at once relieved him, by this beautiful image: &lsquo;Monsieur Goldsmith est comme la mer, qui jette des perles et beaucoup d&rsquo;autres belles choses, sans s&rsquo;en appercevoir.&rsquo; GOLDSMITH. &lsquo;Tres bien dit et tres elegamment.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">A person was mentioned, who it was said could take down in short hand the speeches in parliament with perfect exactness. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, it is impossible. I remember one, Angel, who came to me to write for him a Preface or Dedication to a book upon short hand, and he professed to write as fast as a man could speak. In order to try him, I took down a book, and read while he wrote; and I favoured him, for I read more deliberately than usual. I had proceeded but a very little way, when he begged I would desist, for he could not follow me.&rsquo; Hearing now for the first time of this Preface or Dedication, I said, &lsquo;What an expense, Sir, do you put us to in buying books, to which you have written Prefaces or Dedications.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, I have dedicated to the Royal family all round; that is to say, to the last generation of the Royal family.&rsquo; GOLDSMITH. &lsquo;And perhaps, Sir, not one sentence of wit in a whole Dedication.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Perhaps not, Sir.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;What then is the reason for applying to a particular person to do that which any one may do as well?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, one man has greater readiness at doing it than another.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I spoke of Mr. Harris, of Salisbury, as being a very learned man, and in particular an eminent Grecian. JOHNSON. &lsquo;I am not sure of that. His friends give him out as such, but I know not who of his friends are able to judge of it.&rsquo; GOLDSMITH. &lsquo;He is what is much better: he is a worthy humane man.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Nay, Sir, that is not to the purpose of our argument: that will as much prove that he can play upon the fiddle as well as Giardini, as that he is an eminent Grecian.&rsquo; GOLDSMITH. &lsquo;The greatest musical performers have but small emoluments. Giardini, I am told, does not get above seven hundred a year.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;That is indeed but little for a man to get, who does best that which so many endeavour to do. There is nothing, I think, in which the power of art is shown so much as in playing on the fiddle. In all other things we can do something at first. Any man will forge a bar of iron, if you give him a hammer; not so well as a smith, but tolerably. A man will saw a piece of wood, and make a box, though a clumsy one; but give him a fiddle and a fiddle-stick, and he can do nothing.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Monday, April 19, he called on me with Mrs. Williams, in Mr. Strahan&rsquo;s coach, and carried me out to dine with Mr. Elphinston, at his academy at Kensington. A printer having acquired a fortune sufficient to keep his coach, was a good topick for the credit of literature. Mrs. Williams said, that another printer, Mr. Hamilton, had not waited so long as Mr. Strahan, but had kept his coach several years sooner. JOHNSON. &lsquo;He was in the right. Life is short. The sooner that a man begins to enjoy his wealth the better.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Mr. Elphinston talked of a new book that was much admired, and asked Dr. Johnson if he had read it. JOHNSON. &lsquo;I have looked into it.&rsquo; &lsquo;What, (said Elphinston,) have you not read it through?&rsquo; Johnson, offended at being thus pressed, and so obliged to own his cursory mode of reading, answered tartly, &lsquo;No, Sir, do YOU read books THROUGH?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Wednesday, April 21, I dined with him at Mr. Thrale&rsquo;s. A gentleman attacked Garrick for being vain. JOHNSON. &lsquo;No wonder, Sir, that he is vain; a man who is perpetually flattered in every mode that can be conceived. So many bellows have blown the fire, that one wonders he is not by this time become a cinder.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;And such bellows too. Lord Mansfield with his cheeks like to burst: Lord Chatham like an Aeolus. I have read such notes from them to him, as were enough to turn his head.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;True. When he whom every body else flatters, flatters me, I then am truly happy.&rsquo; Mrs. THRALE. &lsquo;The sentiment is in Congreve, I think.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Yes, Madam, in The Way of the World:</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;If there&rsquo;s delight in love, &rsquo;tis when I see</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That heart which others bleed for, bleed for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">No, Sir, I should not be surprized though Garrick chained the ocean, and lashed the winds.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Should it not be, Sir, lashed the ocean and chained the winds?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;No, Sir, recollect the original:</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;In Corum atque Eurum solitus saevire flagellis</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Barbarus, Aeolia nunquam hoc in carcere passos,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ipsum compedibus qui vinxerat Ennosigaeum.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">The modes of living in different countries, and the various views with which men travel in quest of new scenes, having been talked of, a learned gentleman who holds a considerable office in the law, expatiated on the happiness of a savage life; and mentioned an instance of an officer who had actually lived for some time in the wilds of America, of whom, when in that state, he quoted this reflection with an air of admiration, as if it had been deeply philosophical: &lsquo;Here am I, free and unrestrained, amidst the rude magnificence of Nature, with this Indian woman by my side, and this gun with which I can procure food when I want it; what more can be desired for human happiness?&rsquo; It did not require much sagacity to foresee that such a sentiment would not be permitted to pass without due animadversion. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Do not allow yourself, Sir, to be imposed upon by such gross absurdity. It is sad stuff; it is brutish. If a bull could speak, he might as well exclaim, &mdash; Here am I with this cow and this grass; what being can enjoy greater felicity?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">We talked of the melancholy end of a gentleman who had destroyed himself. JOHNSON. &lsquo;It was owing to imaginary difficulties in his affairs, which, had he talked with any friend, would soon have vanished.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Do you think, Sir, that all who commit suicide are mad?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, they are often not universally disordered in their intellects, but one passion presses so upon them, that they yield to it, and commit suicide, as a passionate man will stab another.&rsquo; He added, &lsquo;I have often thought, that after a man has taken the resolution to kill himself, it is not courage in him to do any thing, however desperate, because he has nothing to fear.&rsquo; GOLDSMITH. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t see that.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Nay, but my dear Sir, why should not you see what every one else sees?&rsquo; GOLDSMITH. &lsquo;It is for fear of something that he has resolved to kill himself; and will not that timid disposition restrain him?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;It does not signify that the fear of something made him resolve; it is upon the state of his mind, after the resolution is taken, that I argue. Suppose a man, either from fear, or pride, or conscience, or whatever motive, has resolved to kill himself; when once the resolution is taken, he has nothing to fear. He may then go and take the King of Prussia by the nose, at the head of his army. He cannot fear the rack, who is resolved to kill himself. When Eustace Budgel was walking down to the Thames, determined to drown himself, he might, if he pleased, without any apprehension of danger, have turned aside, and first set fire to St. James&rsquo;s palace.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Tuesday, April 27, Mr. Beauclerk and I called on him in the morning. As we walked up Johnson&rsquo;s-court, I said, &lsquo;I have a veneration for this court;&rsquo; and was glad to find that Beauclerk had the same reverential enthusiasm. We found him alone. We talked of Mr. Andrew Stuart&rsquo;s elegant and plausible Letters to Lord Mansfield: a copy of which had been sent by the authour to Dr. Johnson. JOHNSON. &lsquo;They have not answered the end. They have not been talked of; I have never heard of them. This is owing to their not being sold. People seldom read a book which is given to them; and few are given. The way to spread a work is to sell it at a low price. No man will send to buy a thing that costs even sixpence, without an intention to read it.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He said, &lsquo;Goldsmith should not be for ever attempting to shine in conversation: he has not temper for it, he is so much mortified when he fails. Sir, a game of jokes is composed partly of skill, partly of chance, a man may be beat at times by one who has not the tenth part of his wit. Now Goldsmith&rsquo;s putting himself against another, is like a man laying a hundred to one who cannot spare the hundred. It is not worth a man&rsquo;s while. A man should not lay a hundred to one, unless he can easily spare it, though he has a hundred chances for him: he can get but a guinea, and he may lose a hundred. Goldsmith is in this state. When he contends, if he gets the better, it is a very little addition to a man of his literary reputation: if he does not get the better, he is miserably vexed.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson&rsquo;s own superlative powers of wit set him above any risk of such uneasiness. Garrick had remarked to me of him, a few days before, &lsquo;Rabelais and all other wits are nothing compared with him. You may be diverted by them; but Johnson gives you a forcible hug, and shakes laughter out of you, whether you will or no.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Goldsmith, however, was often very fortunate in his witty contests, even when he entered the lists with Johnson himself. Sir Joshua Reynolds was in company with them one day, when Goldsmith said, that he thought he could write a good fable, mentioned the simplicity which that kind of composition requires, and observed, that in most fables the animals introduced seldom talk in character. &lsquo;For instance, (said he,) the fable of the little fishes, who saw birds fly over their heads, and envying them, petitioned Jupiter to be changed into birds. The skill (continued he,) consists in making them talk like little fishes.&rsquo; While he indulged himself in this fanciful reverie, he observed Johnson shaking his sides, and laughing. Upon which he smartly proceeded, &lsquo;Why, Dr. Johnson, this is not so easy as you seem to think; for if you were to make little fishes talk, they would talk like WHALES.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Thursday, April 29, I dined with him at General Oglethorpe&rsquo;s, where were Sir Joshua Reynolds, Mr. Langton, Dr. Goldsmith, and Mr. Thrale. I was very desirous to get Dr. Johnson absolutely fixed in his resolution to go with me to the Hebrides this year; and I told him that I had received a letter from Dr. Robertson the historian, upon the subject, with which he was much pleased; and now talked in such a manner of his long-intended tour, that I was satisfied he meant to fulfil his engagement.</p>
<p class="p24">The character of Mallet having been introduced, and spoken of slightingly by Goldsmith; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, Mallet had talents enough to keep his literary reputation alive as long as he himself lived; and that, let me tell you, is a good deal.&rsquo; GOLDSMITH. &lsquo;But I cannot agree that it was so. His literary reputation was dead long before his natural death. I consider an authour&rsquo;s literary reputation to be alive only while his name will ensure a good price for his copy from the booksellers. I will get you (to Johnson,) a hundred guineas for any thing whatever that you shall write, if you put your name to it.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Dr. Goldsmith&rsquo;s new play, She Stoops to Conquer, being mentioned; JOHNSON. &lsquo;I know of no comedy for many years that has so much exhilarated an audience, that has answered so much the great end of comedy &mdash; making an audience merry.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Goldsmith having said, that Garrick&rsquo;s compliment to the Queen, which he introduced into the play of The Chances, which he had altered and revised this year, was mean and gross flattery; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, I would not WRITE, I would not give solemnly under my hand, a character beyond what I thought really true; but a speech on the stage, let it flatter ever so extravagantly, is formular. It has always been formular to flatter Kings and Queens; so much so, that even in our church-service we have &ldquo;our most religious King,&rdquo; used indiscriminately, whoever is King. Nay, they even flatter themselves;&mdash; &ldquo;we have been graciously pleased to grant.&rdquo; No modern flattery, however, is so gross as that of the Augustan age, where the Emperour was deified. &ldquo;Proesens Divus habebitur Augustus.&rdquo; And as to meanness, (rising into warmth,) how is it mean in a player, &mdash; a showman, &mdash; a fellow who exhibits himself for a shilling, to flatter his Queen? The attempt, indeed, was dangerous; for if it had missed, what became of Garrick, and what became of the Queen? As Sir William Temple says of a great General, it is necessary not only that his designs be formed in a masterly manner, but that they should be attended with success. Sir, it is right, at a time when the Royal Family is not generally liked, to let it be seen that the people like at least one of them.&rsquo; SIR JOSHUA REYNOLDS. &lsquo;I do not perceive why the profession of a player should be despised; for the great and ultimate end of all the employments of mankind is to produce amusement. Garrick produces more amusement than any body.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;You say, Dr. Johnson, that Garrick exhibits himself for a shilling. In this respect he is only on a footing with a lawyer who exhibits himself for his fee, and even will maintain any nonsense or absurdity, if the case requires it. Garrick refuses a play or a part which he does not like; a lawyer never refuses.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, what does this prove? only that a lawyer is worse. Boswell is now like Jack in The Tale of a Tub, who, when he is puzzled by an argument, hangs himself. He thinks I shall cut him down, but I&rsquo;ll let him hang.&rsquo; (laughing vociferously.) SIR JOSHUA REYNOLDS. &lsquo;Mr. Boswell thinks that the profession of a lawyer being unquestionably honourable, if he can show the profession of a player to be more honourable, he proves his argument.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Friday, April 30, I dined with him at Mr. Beauclerk&rsquo;s, where were Lord Charlemont, Sir Joshua Reynolds, and some more members of the LITERARY CLUB, whom he had obligingly invited to meet me, as I was this evening to be balloted for as candidate for admission into that distinguished society. Johnson had done me the honour to propose me, and Beauclerk was very zealous for me.</p>
<p class="p24">Goldsmith being mentioned; JOHNSON. &lsquo;It is amazing how little Goldsmith knows. He seldom comes where he is not more ignorant than any one else.&rsquo; SIR JOSHUA REYNOLDS. &lsquo;Yet there is no man whose company is more liked.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;To be sure, Sir. When people find a man of the most distinguished abilities as a writer, their inferiour while he is with them, it must be highly gratifying to them. What Goldsmith comically says of himself is very true, &mdash; he always gets the better when he argues alone; meaning, that he is master of a subject in his study, and can write well upon it; but when he comes into company, grows confused, and unable to talk. Take him as a poet, his Traveller is a very fine performance; ay, and so is his Deserted Village, were it not sometimes too much the echo of his Traveller. Whether, indeed, we take him as a poet, &mdash; as a comick writer, &mdash; or as an historian, he stands in the first class.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;An historian! My dear Sir, you surely will not rank his compilation of the Roman History with the works of other historians of this age?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, who are before him?&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Hume, &mdash; Robertson, &mdash; Lord Lyttelton.&rsquo; JOHNSON (his antipathy to the Scotch beginning to rise). &lsquo;I have not read Hume; but, doubtless, Goldsmith&rsquo;s History is better than the VERBIAGE of Robertson, or the foppery of Dalrymple.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Will you not admit the superiority of Robertson, in whose History we find such penetration &mdash; such painting?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, you must consider how that penetration and that painting are employed. It is not history, it is imagination. He who describes what he never saw, draws from fancy. Robertson paints minds as Sir Joshua paints faces in a history-piece: he imagines an heroic countenance. You must look upon Robertson&rsquo;s work as romance, and try it by that standard. History it is not. Besides, Sir, it is the great excellence of a writer to put into his book as much as his book will hold. Goldsmith has done this in his History. Now Robertson might have put twice as much into his book. Robertson is like a man who has packed gold in wool: the wool takes up more room than the gold. No, Sir; I always thought Robertson would be crushed by his own weight, &mdash; would be buried under his own ornaments. Goldsmith tells you shortly all you want to know: Robertson detains you a great deal too long. No man will read Robertson&rsquo;s cumbrous detail a second time; but Goldsmith&rsquo;s plain narrative will please again and again. I would say to Robertson what an old tutor of a college said to one of his pupils: &ldquo;Read over your compositions, and where ever you meet with a passage which you think is particularly fine, strike it out.&rdquo; Goldsmith&rsquo;s abridgement is better than that of Lucius Florus or Eutropius; and I will venture to say, that if you compare him with Vertot, in the same places of the Roman History, you will find that he excels Vertot. Sir, he has the art of compiling, and of saying every thing he has to say in a pleasing manner. He is now writing a Natural History and will make it as entertaining as a Persian Tale.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I cannot dismiss the present topick without observing, that it is probable that Dr. Johnson, who owned that he often &lsquo;talked for victory,&rsquo; rather urged plausible objections to Dr. Robertson&rsquo;s excellent historical works, in the ardour of contest, than expressed his real and decided opinion; for it is not easy to suppose, that he should so widely differ from the rest of the literary world.</p>
<p class="p24">JOHNSON. &lsquo;I remember once being with Goldsmith in Westminster-abbey. While we surveyed the Poets&rsquo; Corner, I said to him,</p>
<p class="p24">&ldquo;Forsitan et nostrum nomen miscebitur istis.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">when we got to Temple-bar he stopped me, pointed to the heads upon it, and slily whispered me,</p>
<p class="p24">&ldquo;Forsitan et nostrum nomen miscebitur ISTIS.&rdquo;&rsquo;*</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* In allusion to Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s supposed political</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;principles, and perhaps his own.&nbsp; Boswell.</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson praised John Bunyan highly. &lsquo;His Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress has great merit, both for invention, imagination, and the conduct of the story; and it has had the best evidence of its merit, the general and continued approbation of mankind. Few books, I believe, have had a more extensive sale. It is remarkable, that it begins very much like the poem of Dante; yet there was no translation of Dante when Bunyan wrote. There is reason to think that he had read Spenser.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">A proposition which had been agitated, that monuments to eminent persons should, for the time to come, be erected in St. Paul&rsquo;s church as well as in Westminster-abbey, was mentioned; and it was asked, who should be honoured by having his monument first erected there. Somebody suggested Pope. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, as Pope was a Roman Catholick, I would not have his to be first. I think Milton&rsquo;s rather should have the precedence. I think more highly of him now than I did at twenty. There is more thinking in him and in Butler, than in any of our poets.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">The gentlemen went away to their club, and I was left at Beauclerk&rsquo;s till the fate of my election should be announced to me. I sat in a state of anxiety which even the charming conversation of Lady Di Beauclerk could not entirely dissipate. In a short time I received the agreeable intelligence that I was chosen. I hastened to the place of meeting, and was introduced to such a society as can seldom be found. Mr. Edmund Burke, whom I then saw for the first time, and whose splendid talents had long made me ardently wish for his acquaintance; Dr. Nugent, Mr. Garrick, Dr. Goldsmith, Mr. (afterwards Sir William) Jones, and the company with whom I had dined. Upon my entrance, Johnson placed himself behind a chair, on which he leaned as on a desk or pulpit, and with humorous formality gave me a Charge, pointing out the conduct expected from me as a good member of this club.</p>
<p class="p24">Goldsmith produced some very absurd verses which had been publickly recited to an audience for money. JOHNSON. &lsquo;I can match this nonsense. There was a poem called Eugenio, which came out some years ago, and concludes thus:</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;And now, ye trifling, self-assuming elves,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brimful of pride, of nothing, of yourselves,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Survey Eugenio, view him o&rsquo;er and o&rsquo;er,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then sink into yourselves, and be no more.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Nay, Dryden in his poem on the Royal Society, has these lines:</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Then we upon our globe&rsquo;s last verge shall go,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And see the ocean leaning on the sky;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From thence our rolling neighbours we shall know,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And on the lunar world securely pry.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Much pleasant conversation passed, which Johnson relished with great good humour. But his conversation alone, or what led to it, or was interwoven with it, is the business of this work.</p>
<p class="p24">On Saturday, May 1, we dined by ourselves at our old rendezvous, the Mitre tavern. He was placid, but not much disposed to talk. He observed that &lsquo;The Irish mix better with the English than the Scotch do; their language is nearer to English; as a proof of which, they succeed very well as players, which Scotchmen do not. Then, Sir, they have not that extreme nationality which we find in the Scotch. I will do you, Boswell, the justice to say, that you are the most UNSCOTTIFIED of your countrymen. You are almost the only instance of a Scotchman that I have known, who did not at every other sentence bring in some other Scotchman.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Friday, May 7, I breakfasted with him at Mr. Thrale&rsquo;s in the Borough. While we were alone, I endeavoured as well as I could to apologise for a lady who had been divorced from her husband by act of Parliament. I said, that he had used her very ill, had behaved brutally to her, and that she could not continue to live with him without having her delicacy contaminated; that all affection for him was thus destroyed; that the essence of conjugal union being gone, there remained only a cold form, a mere civil obligation; that she was in the prime of life, with qualities to produce happiness; that these ought not to be lost; and, that the gentleman on whose account she was divorced had gained her heart while thus unhappily situated. Seduced, perhaps, by the charms of the lady in question, I thus attempted to palliate what I was sensible could not be justified; for when I had finished my harangue, my venerable friend gave me a proper check: &lsquo;My dear Sir, never accustom your mind to mingle virtue and vice. The woman&rsquo;s a whore, and there&rsquo;s an end on&rsquo;t.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He described the father of one of his friends thus: &lsquo;Sir, he was so exuberant a talker at publick meeting, that the gentlemen of his county were afraid of him. No business could be done for his declamation.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He did not give me full credit when I mentioned that I had carried on a short conversation by signs with some Esquimaux who were then in London, particularly with one of them who was a priest. He thought I could not make them understand me. No man was more incredulous as to particular facts, which were at all extraordinary; and therefore no man was more scrupulously inquisitive, in order to discover the truth.</p>
<p class="p24">I dined with him this day at the house of my friends, Messieurs Edward and Charles Dilly, booksellers in the Poultry: there were present, their elder brother Mr. Dilly of Bedfordshire, Dr. Goldsmith, Mr. Langton, Mr. Claxton, Reverend Dr. Mayo a dissenting minister, the Reverend Mr. Toplady, and my friend the Reverend Mr. Temple.</p>
<p class="p24">BOSWELL. &lsquo;I am well assured that the people of Otaheite who have the bread tree, the fruit of which serves them for bread, laughed heartily when they were informed of the tedious process necessary with us to have bread; &mdash; plowing, sowing, harrowing, reaping, threshing, grinding, baking.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, all ignorant savages will laugh when they are told of the advantages of civilized life. Were you to tell men who live without houses, how we pile brick upon brick, and rafter upon rafter, and that after a house is raised to a certain height, a man tumbles off a scaffold, and breaks his neck; he would laugh heartily at our folly in building; but it does not follow that men are better without houses. No, Sir, (holding up a slice of a good loaf,) this is better than the bread tree.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I introduced the subject of toleration. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Every society has a right to preserve publick peace and order, and therefore has a good right to prohibit the propagation of opinions which have a dangerous tendency. To say the MAGISTRATE has this right, is using an inadequate word: it is the SOCIETY for which the magistrate is agent. He may be morally or theologically wrong in restraining the propagation of opinions which he thinks dangerous, but he is politically right.&rsquo; MAYO. &lsquo;I am of opinion, Sir, that every man is entitled to liberty of conscience in religion; and that the magistrate cannot restrain that right.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, I agree with you. Every man has a right to liberty of conscience, and with that the magistrate cannot interfere. People confound liberty of thinking with liberty of talking; nay, with liberty of preaching. Every man has a physical right to think as he pleases; for it cannot be discovered how he thinks. He has not a moral right, for he ought to inform himself, and think justly. But, Sir, no member of a society has a right to TEACH any doctrine contrary to what the society holds to be true. The magistrate, I say, may be wrong in what he thinks: but while he thinks himself right, he may and ought to enforce what he thinks.&rsquo; MAYO. &lsquo;Then, Sir, we are to remain always in errour, and truth never can prevail; and the magistrate was right in persecuting the first Christians.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, the only method by which religious truth can be established is by martyrdom. The magistrate has a right to enforce what he thinks; and he who is conscious of the truth has a right to suffer. I am afraid there is no other way of ascertaining the truth, but by persecution on the one hand and enduring it on the other.&rsquo; GOLDSMITH. &lsquo;But how is a man to act, Sir? Though firmly convinced of the truth of his doctrine, may he not think it wrong to expose himself to persecution? Has he a right to do so? Is it not, as it were, committing voluntary suicide?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, as to voluntary suicide, as you call it, there are twenty thousand men in an army who will go without scruple to be shot at, and mount a breach for five-pence a day.&rsquo; GOLDSMITH. &lsquo;But have they a moral right to do this?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Nay, Sir, if you will not take the universal opinion of mankind, I have nothing to say. If mankind cannot defend their own way of thinking, I cannot defend it. Sir, if a man is in doubt whether it would be better for him to expose himself to martyrdom or not, he should not do it. He must be convinced that he has a delegation from heaven.&rsquo; GOLDSMITH. &lsquo;I would consider whether there is the greater chance of good or evil upon the whole. If I see a man who had fallen into a well, I would wish to help him out; but if there is a greater probability that he shall pull me in, than that I shall pull him out, I would not attempt it. So were I to go to Turkey, I might wish to convert the Grand Signor to the Christian faith; but when I considered that I should probably be put to death without effectuating my purpose in any degree, I should keep myself quiet.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, you must consider that we have perfect and imperfect obligations. Perfect obligations, which are generally not to do something, are clear and positive; as, &ldquo;thou shalt not kill?&rsquo; But charity, for instance, is not definable by limits. It is a duty to give to the poor; but no man can say how much another should give to the poor, or when a man has given too little to save his soul. In the same manner it is a duty to instruct the ignorant, and of consequence to convert infidels to Christianity; but no man in the common course of things is obliged to carry this to such a degree as to incur the danger of martyrdom, as no man is obliged to strip himself to the shirt in order to give charity. I have said, that a man must be persuaded that he has a particular delegation from heaven.&rsquo; GOLDSMITH. &lsquo;How is this to be known? Our first reformers, who were burnt for not believing bread and wine to be CHRIST&rsquo; &mdash; JOHNSON. (interrupting him,) &lsquo;Sir, they were not burnt for not believing bread and wine to be CHRIST, but for insulting those who did believe it. And, Sir, when the first reformers began, they did not intend to be martyred: as many of them ran away as could.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;But, Sir, there was your countryman, Elwal, who you told me challenged King George with his black-guards, and his red-guards.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;My countryman, Elwal, Sir, should have been put in the stocks; a proper pulpit for him; and he&rsquo;d have had a numerous audience. A man who preaches in the stocks will always have hearers enough.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;But Elwal thought himself in the right.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;We are not providing for mad people; there are places for them in the neighbourhood.&rsquo; (meaning moorfields.) MAYO. &lsquo;But, Sir, is it not very hard that I should not be allowed to teach my children what I really believe to be the truth?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, you might contrive to teach your children extra scandalum; but, Sir, the magistrate, if he knows it, has a right to restrain you. Suppose you teach your children to be thieves?&rsquo; MAYO. &lsquo;This is making a joke of the subject.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Nay, Sir, take it thus: &mdash; that you teach them the community of goods; for which there are as many plausible arguments as for most erroneous doctrines. You teach them that all things at first were in common, and that no man had a right to any thing but as he laid his hands upon it; and that this still is, or ought to be, the rule amongst mankind. Here, Sir, you sap a great principle in society, &mdash; property. And don&rsquo;t you think the magistrate would have a right to prevent you? Or, suppose you should teach your children the notion of the Adamites, and they should run naked into the streets, would not the magistrate have a right to flog &rsquo;em into their doublets?&rsquo; MAYO. &lsquo;I think the magistrate has no right to interfere till there is some overt act.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;So, Sir, though he sees an enemy to the state charging a blunderbuss, he is not to interfere till it is fired off?&rsquo; MAYO. &lsquo;He must be sure of its direction against the state.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;The magistrate is to judge of that. &mdash; He has no right to restrain your thinking, because the evil centers in yourself. If a man were sitting at this table, and chopping off his fingers, the magistrate, as guardian of the community, has no authority to restrain him, however he might do it from kindness as a parent. &mdash; Though, indeed, upon more consideration, I think he may; as it is probable, that he who is chopping off his own fingers, may soon proceed to chop off those of other people. If I think it right to steal Mr. Dilly&rsquo;s plate, I am a bad man; but he can say nothing to me. If I make an open declaration that I think so, he will keep me out of his house. If I put forth my hand, I shall be sent to Newgate. This is the gradation of thinking, preaching, and acting: if a man thinks erroneously, he may keep his thoughts to himself, and nobody will trouble him; if he preaches erroneous doctrine, society may expel him; if he acts in consequence of it, the law takes place, and he is hanged.&rsquo; MAYO. &lsquo;But, Sir, ought not Christians to have liberty of conscience?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;I have already told you so, Sir. You are coming back to where you were.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Dr. Mayo is always taking a return post-chaise, and going the stage over again. He has it at half price.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Dr. Mayo, like other champions for unlimited toleration, has got a set of words. Sir, it is no matter, politically, whether the magistrate be right or wrong. Suppose a club were to be formed, to drink confusion to King George the Third, and a happy restoration to Charles the Third, this would be very bad with respect to the State; but every member of that club must either conform to its rules, or be turned out of it. Old Baxter, I remember, maintains, that the magistrate should &ldquo;tolerate all things that are tolerable.&rdquo; This is no good definition of toleration upon any principle; but it shows that he thought some things were not tolerable.&rsquo; TOPLADY. &lsquo;Sir, you have untwisted this difficult subject with great dexterity.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">During this argument, Goldsmith sat in restless agitation, from a wish to get in and SHINE. Finding himself excluded, he had taken his hat to go away, but remained for some time with it in his hand, like a gamester, who at the close of a long night, lingers for a little while, to see if he can have a favourable opening to finish with success. Once when he was beginning to speak, he found himself overpowered by the loud voice of Johnson, who was at the opposite end of the table, and did not perceive Goldsmith&rsquo;s attempt. Thus disappointed of his wish to obtain the attention of the company, Goldsmith in a passion threw down his hat, looking angrily at Johnson, and exclaiming in a bitter tone, &lsquo;TAKE IT.&rsquo; When Toplady was going to speak, Johnson uttered some sound, which led Goldsmith to think that he was beginning again, and taking the words from Toplady. Upon which, he seized this opportunity of venting his own envy and spleen, under the pretext of supporting another person:</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Sir, (said he to Johnson,) the gentleman has heard you patiently for an hour; pray allow us now to hear him.&rsquo; JOHNSON. (sternly,) &lsquo;Sir, I was not interrupting the gentleman. I was only giving him a signal of my attention. Sir, you are impertinent.&rsquo; Goldsmith made no reply, but continued in the company for some time.</p>
<p class="p24">A gentleman present ventured to ask Dr. Johnson if there was not a material difference as to toleration of opinions which lead to action, and opinions merely speculative; for instance, would it be wrong in the magistrate to tolerate those who preach against the doctrine of the TRINITY? Johnson was highly offended, and said, &lsquo;I wonder, Sir, how a gentleman of your piety can introduce this subject in a mixed company.&rsquo; He told me afterwards, that the impropriety was, that perhaps some of the company might have talked on the subject in such terms as might have shocked him; or he might have been forced to appear in their eyes a narrow-minded man. The gentleman, with submissive deference, said, he had only hinted at the question from a desire to hear Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s opinion upon it. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why then, Sir, I think that permitting men to preach any opinion contrary to the doctrine of the established church tends, in a certain degree, to lessen the authority of the church, and consequently, to lessen the influence of religion.&rsquo; &lsquo;It may be considered, (said the gentleman,) whether it would not be politick to tolerate in such a case.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, we have been talking of RIGHT: this is another question. I think it is NOT politick to tolerate in such a case.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">BOSWELL. &lsquo;Pray, Mr. Dilly, how does Dr. Leland&rsquo;s History of Ireland sell?&rsquo; JOHNSON. (bursting forth with a generous indignation,) &lsquo;The Irish are in a most unnatural state; for we see there the minority prevailing over the majority. There is no instance, even in the ten persecutions, of such severity as that which the protestants of Ireland have exercised against the Catholicks. Did we tell them we have conquered them, it would be above board: to punish them by confiscation and other penalties, as rebels, was monstrous injustice. King William was not their lawful sovereign: he had not been acknowledged by the Parliament of Ireland, when they appeared in arms against him.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He and Mr. Langton and I went together to THE CLUB, where we found Mr. Burke, Mr. Garrick, and some other members, and amongst them our friend Goldsmith, who sat silently brooding over Johnson&rsquo;s reprimand to him after dinner. Johnson perceived this, and said aside to some of us, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll make Goldsmith forgive me;&rsquo; and then called to him in a loud voice, &lsquo;Dr. Goldsmith, &mdash; something passed to-day where you and I dined; I ask your pardon.&rsquo; Goldsmith answered placidly, &lsquo;It must be much from you, Sir, that I take ill.&rsquo; And so at once the difference was over, and they were on as easy terms as ever, and Goldsmith rattled away as usual.</p>
<p class="p24">In our way to the club to-night, when I regretted that Goldsmith would, upon every occasion, endeavour to shine, by which he often exposed himself, Mr. Langton observed, that he was not like Addison, who was content with the fame of his writings, and did not aim also at excellency in conversation, for which he found himself unfit; and that he said to a lady who complained of his having talked little in company, &lsquo;Madam, I have but ninepence in ready money, but I can draw for a thousand pounds.&rsquo; I observed, that Goldsmith had a great deal of gold in his cabinet, but, not content with that, was always taking out his purse. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Yes, Sir, and that so often an empty purse!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Goldsmith&rsquo;s incessant desire of being conspicuous in company, was the occasion of his sometimes appearing to such disadvantage as one should hardly have supposed possible in a man of his genius. When his literary reputation had risen deservedly high, and his society was much courted, he became very jealous of the extraordinary attention which was every where paid to Johnson. One evening, in a circle of wits, he found fault with me for talking of Johnson as entitled to the honour of unquestionable superiority. &lsquo;Sir, (said he,) you are for making a monarchy of what should be a republick.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He was still more mortified, when talking in a company with fluent vivacity, and, as he flattered himself, to the admiration of all who were present; a German who sat next him, and perceived Johnson rolling himself, as if about to speak, suddenly stopped him, saying, &lsquo;Stay, stay, &mdash; Toctor Shonson is going to say something.&rsquo; This was, no doubt, very provoking, especially to one so irritable as Goldsmith, who frequently mentioned it with strong expressions of indignation.</p>
<p class="p24">It may also be observed, that Goldsmith was sometimes content to be treated with an easy familiarity, but, upon occasions, would be consequential and important. An instance of this occurred in a small particular. Johnson had a way of contracting the names of his friends; as Beauclerk, Beau; Boswell, Bozzy; Langton, Lanky; Murphy, Mur; Sheridan, Sherry. I remember one day, when Tom Davies was telling that Dr. Johnson said, &lsquo;We are all in labour for a name to GOLDY&rsquo;S play,&rsquo; Goldsmith seemed displeased that such a liberty should be taken with his name, and said, &lsquo;I have often desired him not to call me GOLDY.&rsquo; Tom was remarkably attentive to the most minute circumstance about Johnson. I recollect his telling me once, on my arrival in London, &lsquo;Sir, our great friend has made an improvement on his appellation of old Mr. Sheridan. He calls him now Sherry derry.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Monday, May 9, as I was to set out on my return to Scotland next morning, I was desirous to see as much of Dr. Johnson as I could. But I first called on Goldsmith to take leave of him. The jealousy and envy which, though possessed of many most amiable qualities, he frankly avowed, broke out violently at this interview. Upon another occasion, when Goldsmith confessed himself to be of an envious disposition, I contended with Johnson that we ought not to be angry with him, he was so candid in owning it. &lsquo;Nay, Sir, (said Johnson,) we must be angry that a man has such a superabundance of an odious quality, that he cannot keep it within his own breast, but it boils over.&rsquo; In my opinion, however, Goldsmith had not more of it than other people have, but only talked of it freely.</p>
<p class="p24">He now seemed very angry that Johnson was going to be a traveller; said &lsquo;he would be a dead weight for me to carry, and that I should never be able to lug him along through the Highlands and Hebrides.&rsquo; Nor would he patiently allow me to enlarge upon Johnson&rsquo;s wonderful abilities; but exclaimed, &lsquo;Is he like Burke, who winds into a subject like a serpent?&rsquo; &lsquo;But, (said I,) Johnson is the Hercules who strangled serpents in his cradle.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I dined with Dr. Johnson at General Paoli&rsquo;s. He was obliged, by indisposition, to leave the company early; he appointed me, however, to meet him in the evening at Mr. (now Sir Robert) Chambers&rsquo;s in the Temple, where he accordingly came, though he continued to be very ill. Chambers, as is common on such occasions, prescribed various remedies to him. JOHNSON. (fretted by pain,) &lsquo;Pr&rsquo;ythee don&rsquo;t tease me. Stay till I am well, and then you shall tell me how to cure myself.&rsquo; He grew better, and talked with a noble enthusiasm of keeping up the representation of respectable families. His zeal on this subject was a circumstance in his character exceedingly remarkable, when it is considered that he himself had no pretensions to blood. I heard him once say, &lsquo;I have great merit in being zealous for subordination and the honours of birth; for I can hardly tell who was my grandfather.&rsquo; He maintained the dignity and propriety of male succession, in opposition to the opinion of one of our friends, who had that day employed Mr. Chambers to draw his will, devising his estate to his three sisters, in preference to a remote heir male. Johnson called them &lsquo;three DOWDIES,&rsquo; and said, with as high a spirit as the boldest Baron in the most perfect days of the feudal system, &lsquo;An ancient estate should always go to males. It is mighty foolish to let a stranger have it because he marries your daughter, and takes your name. As for an estate newly acquired by trade, you may give it, if you will, to the dog Towser, and let him keep his OWN name.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I have known him at times exceedingly diverted at what seemed to others a very small sport. He now laughed immoderately, without any reason that we could perceive, at our friend&rsquo;s making his will; called him the TESTATOR, and added, &lsquo;I dare say, he thinks he has done a mighty thing. He won&rsquo;t stay till he gets home to his seat in the country, to produce this wonderful deed: he&rsquo;ll call up the landlord of the first inn on the road; and, after a suitable preface upon mortality and the uncertainty of life, will tell him that he should not delay making his will; and here, Sir, will he say, is my will, which I have just made, with the assistance of one of the ablest lawyers in the kingdom; and he will read it to him (laughing all the time). He believes he has made this will; but he did not make it: you, Chambers, made it for him. I trust you have had more conscience than to make him say, &ldquo;being of sound understanding;&rdquo; ha, ha, ha! I hope he has left me a legacy. I&rsquo;d have his will turned into verse, like a ballad.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Mr. Chambers did not by any means relish this jocularity upon a matter of which pars magna fuit, and seemed impatient till he got rid of us. Johnson could not stop his merriment, but continued it all the way till we got without the Temple-gate. He then burst into such a fit of laughter, that he appeared to be almost in a convulsion; and, in order to support himself, laid hold of one of the posts at the side of the foot pavement, and sent forth peals so loud, that in the silence of the night his voice seemed to resound from Temple-bar to Fleet-ditch.</p>
<p class="p24">This most ludicrous exhibition of the aweful, melancholy, and venerable Johnson, happened well to counteract the feelings of sadness which I used to experience when parting with him for a considerable time. I accompanied him to his door, where he gave me his blessing.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;TO JAMES BOSWELL, ESQ.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;DEAR Sir, &mdash; I shall set out from London on Friday the sixth of this month, and purpose not to loiter much by the way. Which day I shall be at Edinburgh, I cannot exactly tell. I suppose I must drive to an inn, and send a porter to find you.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am afraid Beattie will not be at his College soon enough for us, and I shall be sorry to miss him; but there is no staying for the concurrence of all conveniences. We will do as well as we can. I am, Sir, your most humble servant,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;August 3, 1773.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo; TO JAMES BOSWELL, ESQ.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Newcastle, Aug. 11, 1773.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;DEAR SIR, I came hither last night, and hope, but do not absolutely promise, to be in Edinburgh on Saturday. Beattie will not come so soon. I am, Sir, your most humble servant,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;My compliments to your lady.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo; TO THE SAME.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Mr. Johnson sends his compliments to Mr. Boswell, being just arrived at Boyd&rsquo;s. &mdash; Saturday night.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">His stay in Scotland was from the 18th of August, on which day he arrived, till the 22nd of November, when he set out on his return to London; and I believe ninety-four days were never passed by any man in a more vigorous exertion.*</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* In his Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides, published the</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;year after Johnson died, Boswell gives a detailed account of</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Johnson&rsquo;s conversation and adventures with him throughout</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the journey of 1773.&nbsp; Partly owing to their uninterrupted</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;association, partly to the strangeness and variation of</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;background and circumstances, and partly to Boswell&rsquo;s larger</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;leisure during the tour for the elaboration of his account,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the journal is even more racy, picturesque, and interesting</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;than any equal part of the Life.&nbsp; No reader who enjoys the</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Life should fail to read the Tour &mdash; unabridged! &mdash; ED.</p>
<p class="p24">His humane forgiving disposition was put to a pretty strong test on his return to London, by a liberty which Mr. Thomas Davies had taken with him in his absence, which was, to publish two volumes, entitled, Miscellaneous and fugitive Pieces, which he advertised in the news-papers, &lsquo;By the Authour of the Rambler.&rsquo; In this collection, several of Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s acknowledged writings, several of his anonymous performances, and some which he had written for others, were inserted; but there were also some in which he had no concern whatever. He was at first very angry, as he had good reason to be. But, upon consideration of his poor friend&rsquo;s narrow circumstances, and that he had only a little profit in view, and meant no harm, he soon relented, and continued his kindness to him as formerly.</p>
<p class="p24">In the course of his self-examination with retrospect to this year, he seems to have been much dejected; for he says, January 1, 1774, &lsquo;This year has passed with so little improvement, that I doubt whether I have not rather impaired than increased my learning&rsquo;; and yet we have seen how he READ, and we know how he TALKED during that period.</p>
<p class="p24">He was now seriously engaged in writing an account of our travels in the Hebrides, in consequence of which I had the pleasure of a more frequent correspondence with him.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;TO BENNET LANGTON, ESQ., AT LANGTON, NEAR SPILSBY, LINCOLNSHIRE.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;DEAR SIR, &mdash; You have reason to reproach me that I have left your last letter so long unanswered, but I had nothing particular to say. Chambers, you find, is gone far, and poor Goldsmith is gone much further. He died of a fever, exasperated, as I believe, by the fear of distress. He had raised money and squandered it, by every artifice of acquisition, and folly of expence. But let not his frailties be remembered; he was a very great man.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I have just begun to print my Journey to the Hebrides, and am leaving the press to take another journey into Wales, whither Mr. Thrale is going, to take possession of, at least, five hundred a year, fallen to his lady. All at Streatham, that are alive, are well.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I have never recovered from the last dreadful illness, but flatter myself that I grow gradually better; much, however, yet remains to mend. [Greek text omitted].</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;If you have the Latin version of Busy, curious, thirsty fly, be so kind as to transcribe and send it; but you need not be in haste, for I shall be I know not where, for at least five weeks. I wrote the following tetastrick on poor Goldsmith: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">[Greek text omitted]</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Please to make my most respectful compliments to all the ladies, and remember me to young George and his sisters. I reckon George begins to shew a pair of heels.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Do not be sullen now, but let me find a letter when I come back. I am, dear Sir, your affectionate, humble servant,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;July 5,1774.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">In his manuscript diary of this year, there is the following entry: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Nov. 27. Advent Sunday. I considered that this day, being the beginning of the ecclesiastical year, was a proper time for a new course of life. I began to read the Greek Testament regularly at 160 verses every Sunday. This day I began the Acts.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;In this week I read Virgil&rsquo;s Pastorals. I learned to repeat the Pollio and Gallus. I read carelessly the first Georgick.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Such evidences of his unceasing ardour, both for &lsquo;divine and human lore,&rsquo; when advanced into his sixty-fifth year, and notwithstanding his many disturbances from disease, must make us at once honour his spirit, and lament that it should be so grievously clogged by its material tegument.</p>
<p class="p24">1775: AETAT. 66.]&mdash; &lsquo;MR. BOSWELL TO DR. JOHNSON.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Edinburgh, Feb. 2,1775.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;. . . As to Macpherson,&rsquo; I am anxious to have from yourself a full and pointed account of what has passed between you and him. It is confidently told here, that before your book came out he sent to you, to let you know that he understood you meant to deny the authenticity of Ossian&rsquo;s poems; that the originals were in his possession; that you might have inspection of them, and might take the evidence of people skilled in the Erse language; and that he hoped, after this fair offer, you would not be so uncandid as to assert that he had refused reasonable proof. That you paid no regard to his message, but published your strong attack upon him; and then he wrote a letter to you, in such terms as he thought suited to one who had not acted as a man of veracity.&rsquo; . . .</p>
<p class="p24">What words were used by Mr. Macpherson in his letter to the venerable Sage, I have never heard; but they are generally said to have been of a nature very different from the language of literary contest. Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s answer appeared in the news-papers of the day, and has since been frequently re-published; but not with perfect accuracy. I give it as dictated to me by himself, written down in his presence, and authenticated by a note in his own handwriting, &lsquo;This, I think, is a true copy.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;MR. JAMES MACPHERSON, &mdash; I received your foolish and impudent letter. Any violence offered me I shall do my best to repel; and what I cannot do for myself, the law shall do for me. I hope I shall never be deterred from detecting what I think a cheat, by the menaces of a ruffian.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;What would you have me retract? I thought your book an imposture; I think it an imposture still. For this opinion I have given my reasons to the publick, which I here dare you to refute. Your rage I defy. Your abilities, since your Homer, are not so formidable; and what I hear of your morals, inclines me to pay regard not to what you shall say, but to what you shall prove. You may print this if you will.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Mr. Macpherson little knew the character of Dr. Johnson, if he supposed that he could be easily intimidated; for no man was ever more remarkable for personal courage. He had, indeed, an aweful dread of death, or rather, &lsquo;of something after death;&rsquo; and what rational man, who seriously thinks of quitting all that he has ever known, and going into a new and unknown state of being, can be without that dread? But his fear was from reflection; his courage natural. His fear, in that one instance, was the result of philosophical and religious consideration. He feared death, but he feared nothing else, not even what might occasion death. Many instances of his resolution may be mentioned. One day, at Mr. Beauclerk&rsquo;s house in the country, when two large dogs were fighting, he went up to them, and beat them till they separated; and at another time, when told of the danger there was that a gun might burst if charged with many balls, he put in six or seven, and fired it off against a wall. Mr. Langton told me, that when they were swimming together near Oxford, he cautioned Dr. Johnson against a pool, which was reckoned particularly dangerous; upon which Johnson directly swam into it. He told me himself that one night he was attacked in the street by four men, to whom he would not yield, but kept them all at bay, till the watch came up, and carried both him and them to the round-house. In the playhouse at Lichfield, as Mr. Garrick informed me, Johnson having for a moment quitted a chair which was placed for him between the side-scenes, a gentleman took possession of it, and when Johnson on his return civilly demanded his seat, rudely refused to give it up; upon which Johnson laid hold of it, and tossed him and the chair into the pit. Foote, who so successfully revived the old comedy, by exhibiting living characters, had resolved to imitate Johnson on the stage, expecting great profits from his ridicule of so celebrated a man. Johnson being informed of his intention, and being at dinner at Mr. Thomas Davies&rsquo;s the bookseller, from whom I had the story, he asked Mr. Davies &lsquo;what was the common price of an oak stick;&rsquo; and being answered six-pence, &lsquo;Why then, Sir, (said he,) give me leave to send your servant to purchase me a shilling one. I&rsquo;ll have a double quantity; for I am told Foote means to take me off, as he calls it, and I am determined the fellow shall not do it with impunity. Davies took care to acquaint Foote of this, which effectually checked the wantonness of the mimick. Mr. Macpherson&rsquo;s menaces made Johnson provide himself with the same implement of defence; and had he been attacked, I have no doubt that, old as he was, he would have made his corporal prowess be felt as much as his intellectual.</p>
<p class="p24">His Journey to the Western Islands of Scotland is a most valuable performance. Johnson&rsquo;s grateful acknowledgements of kindnesses received in the course of this tour, completely refute the brutal reflections which have been thrown out against him, as if he had made an ungrateful return; and his delicacy in sparing in his book those who we find from his letters to Mrs. Thrale were just objects of censure, is much to be admired. His candour and amiable disposition is conspicuous from his conduct, when informed by Mr. Macleod, of Rasay, that he had committed a mistake, which gave that gentleman some uneasiness. He wrote him a courteous and kind letter, and inserted in the news-papers an advertisement, correcting the mistake.</p>
<p class="p24">As to his prejudice against the Scotch, which I always ascribed to that nationality which he observed in THEM, he said to the same gentleman, &lsquo;When I find a Scotchman, to whom an Englishman is as a Scotchman, that Scotchman shall be as an Englishman to me.&rsquo; His intimacy with many gentlemen of Scotland, and his employing so many natives of that country as his amanuenses, prove that his prejudice was not virulent; and I have deposited in the British Museum, amongst other pieces of his writing, the following note in answer to one from me, asking if he would meet me at dinner at the Mitre, though a friend of mine, a Scotchman, was to be there: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Mr. Johnson does not see why Mr. Boswell should suppose a Scotchman less acceptable than any other man. He will be at the Mitre.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">My much-valued friend Dr. Barnard, now Bishop of Killaloc, having once expressed to him an apprehension, that if he should visit Ireland he might treat the people of that country more unfavourably than he had done the Scotch, he answered, with strong pointed double-edged wit, &lsquo;Sir, you have no reason to be afraid of me. The Irish are not in a conspiracy to cheat the world by false representations of the merits of their countrymen. No, Sir; the Irish are a FAIR PEOPLE; &mdash; they never speak well of one another.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">All the miserable cavillings against his Journey, in newspapers, magazines, and other fugitive publications, I can speak from certain knowledge, only furnished him with sport. At last there came out a scurrilous volume, larger than Johnson&rsquo;s own, filled with malignant abuse, under a name, real or fictitious, of some low man in an obscure corner of Scotland, though supposed to be the work of another Scotchman, who has found means to make himself well known both in Scotland and England. The effect which it had upon Johnson was, to produce this pleasant observation to Mr. Seward, to whom he lent the book: &lsquo;This fellow must be a blockhead. They don&rsquo;t know how to go about their abuse. Who will read a five-shilling book against me? No, Sir, if they had wit, they should have kept pelting me with pamphlets.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Tuesday, March 21, I arrived in London; and on repairing to Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s before dinner, found him in his study, sitting with Mr. Peter Garrick, the elder brother of David, strongly resembling him in countenance and voice, but of more sedate and placid manners. Johnson informed me, that &lsquo;though Mr. Beauclerk was in great pain, it was hoped he was not in danger, and that he now wished to consult Dr. Heberden to try the effect of a NEW UNDERSTANDING.&rsquo; Both at this interview, and in the evening at Mr. Thrale&rsquo;s where he and Mr. Peter Garrick and I met again, he was vehement on the subject of the Ossian controversy; observing, &lsquo;We do not know that there are any ancient Erse manuscripts; and we have no other reason to disbelieve that there are men with three heads, but that we do not know that there are any such men.&rsquo; He also was outrageous upon his supposition that my countrymen &lsquo;loved Scotland better than truth,&rsquo; saying, &lsquo;All of them, &mdash; nay not all, &mdash; but DROVES of them, would come up, and attest any thing for the honour of Scotland.&rsquo; He also persevered in his wild allegation, that he questioned if there was a tree between Edinburgh and the English border older than himself. I assured him he was mistaken, and suggested that the proper punishment would be that he should receive a stripe at every tree above a hundred years old, that was found within that space. He laughed, and said, &lsquo;I believe I might submit to it for a BAUBEE!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">The doubts which, in my correspondence with him, I had ventured to state as to the justice and wisdom of the conduct of Great-Britain towards the American colonies, while I at the same time requested that he would enable me to inform myself upon that momentous subject, he had altogether disregarded; and had recently published a pamphlet, entitled, Taxation no Tyranny; an answer to the Resolutions and Address of the American Congress.</p>
<p class="p24">He had long before indulged most unfavourable sentiments of our fellow-subjects in America. For, as early as 1769, I was told by Dr. John Campbell, that he had said of them, &lsquo;Sir, they are a race of convicts, and ought to be thankful for any thing we allow them short of hanging.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Of this performance I avoided to talk with him; for I had now formed a clear and settled opinion, that the people of America were well warranted to resist a claim that their fellow-subjects in the mother-country should have the entire command of their fortunes, by taxing them without their own consent; and the extreme violence which it breathed, appeared to me so unsuitable to the mildness of a christian philosopher, and so directly opposite to the principles of peace which he had so beautifully recommended in his pamphlet respecting Falkland&rsquo;s Islands, that I was sorry to see him appear in so unfavourable a light.</p>
<p class="p24">On Friday, March 24, I met him at the LITERARY CLUB, where were Mr. Beauclerk, Mr. Langton, Mr. Colman, Dr. Percy, Mr. Vesey, Sir Charles Bunbury, Dr. George Fordyce, Mr. Steevens, and Mr. Charles Fox. Before he came in, we talked of his Journey to the Western Islands, and of his coming away &lsquo;willing to believe the second sight,&rsquo; which seemed to excite some ridicule. I was then so impressed with the truth of many of the stories of it which I had been told, that I avowed my conviction, saying, &lsquo;He is only WILLING to believe: I DO believe. The evidence is enough for me, though not for his great mind. What will not fill a quart bottle will fill a pint bottle. I am filled with belief.&rsquo; &lsquo;Are you? (said Colman,) then cork it up.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I found his Journey the common topick of conversation in London at this time, wherever I happened to be. At one of Lord Mansfield&rsquo;s formal Sunday evening conversations, strangely called Levees, his Lordship addressed me, &lsquo;We have all been reading your travels, Mr. Boswell.&rsquo; I answered, &lsquo;I was but the humble attendant of Dr. Johnson.&rsquo; The Chief Justice replied, with that air and manner which none, who ever saw and heard him, can forget, &lsquo;He speaks ill of nobody but Ossian.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson was in high spirits this evening at the club, and talked with great animation and success. He attacked Swift, as he used to do upon all occasions. The Tale of a Tub is so much superiour to his other writings, that one can hardly believe he was the authour of it: &lsquo;there is in it such a vigour of mind, such a swarm of thoughts, so much of nature, and art, and life.&rsquo; I wondered to hear him say of Gulliver&rsquo;s Travels, &lsquo;When once you have thought of big men and little men, it is very easy to do all the rest.&rsquo; I endeavoured to make a stand for Swift, and tried to rouse those who were much more able to defend him; but in vain. Johnson at last, of his own accord, allowed very great merit to the inventory of articles found in the pocket of the Man Mountain, particularly the description of his watch, which it was conjectured was his God; as he consulted it upon all occasions. He observed, that &lsquo;Swift put his name to but two things, (after he had a name to put,) The Plan for the Improvement of the English Language, and the last Drapier&rsquo;s Letter.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">From Swift, there was an easy transition to Mr. Thomas Sheridan &mdash; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sheridan is a wonderful admirer of the tragedy of Douglas, and presented its authour with a gold medal. Some years ago, at a coffee-house in Oxford, I called to him, &ldquo;Mr. Sheridan, Mr. Sheridan, how came you to give a gold medal to Home, for writing that foolish play?&rdquo; This you see, was wanton and insolent; but I MEANT to be wanton and insolent. A medal has no value but as a stamp of merit. And was Sheridan to assume to himself the right of giving that stamp? If Sheridan was magnificent enough to bestow a gold medal as an honorary reward of dramatick excellence, he should have requested one of the Universities to choose the person on whom it should be conferred. Sheridan had no right to give a stamp of merit: it was counterfeiting Apollo&rsquo;s coin.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Monday, March 27, I breakfasted with him at Mr Strahan&rsquo;s. He told us, that he was engaged to go that evening to Mrs. Abington&rsquo;s benefit. &lsquo;She was visiting some ladies whom I was visiting, and begged that I would come to her benefit. I told her I could not hear: but she insisted so much on my coming, that it would have been brutal to have refused her.&rsquo; This was a speech quite characteristical. He loved to bring forward his having been in the gay circles of life; and he was, perhaps, a little vain of the solicitations of this elegant and fashionable actress. He told us, the play was to be the The Hypocrite, altered from Cibber&rsquo;s Nonjuror, so as to satirize the Methodists. &lsquo;I do not think (said he,) the character of The Hypocrite justly applicable to the Methodists, but it was very applicable to the Nonjurors.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Mr. Strahan had taken a poor boy from the country as an apprentice, upon Johnson&rsquo;s recommendation. Johnson having enquired after him, said, &lsquo;Mr. Strahan, let me have five guineas on account, and I&rsquo;ll give this boy one. Nay if a man recommends a boy, and does nothing for him, it is sad work. Call him down.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I followed him into the court-yard, behind Mr. Strahan&rsquo;s house; and there I had a proof of what I had heard him profess, that he talked alike to all. &lsquo;Some people tell you that they let themselves down to the capacity of their hearers. I never do that. I speak uniformly, in as intelligible a manner as I can.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Well, my boy, how do you go on?&rsquo;&mdash; &lsquo;Pretty well, Sir; but they are afraid I an&rsquo;t strong enough for some parts of the business.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, I shall be sorry for it; for when you consider with how little mental power and corporeal labour a printer can get a guinea a week, it is a very desirable occupation for you. Do you hear, &mdash; take all the pains you can; and if this does not do, we must think of some other way of life for you. There&rsquo;s a guinea.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Here was one of the many, many instances of his active benevolence. At the same time, the slow and sonorous solemnity with which, while he bent himself down, he addressed a little thick short-legged boy, contrasted with the boy&rsquo;s aukwardness and awe, could not but excite some ludicrous emotions.</p>
<p class="p24">I met him at Drury-lane play-house in the evening. Sir Joshua Reynolds, at Mrs. Abington&rsquo;s request, had promised to bring a body of wits to her benefit; and having secured forty places in the front boxes, had done me the honour to put me in the group. Johnson sat on the seat directly behind me; and as he could neither see nor hear at such a distance from the stage, he was wrapped up in grave abstraction, and seemed quite a cloud, amidst all the sunshine of glitter and gaiety. I wondered at his patience in sitting out a play of five acts, and a farce of two. He said very little; but after the prologue to Bon Ton had been spoken, which he could hear pretty well from the more slow and distinct utterance, he talked of prologue-writing, and observed, &lsquo;Dryden has written prologues superiour to any that David Garrick has written; but David Garrick has written more good prologues than Dryden has done. It is wonderful that he has been able to write such variety of them.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">At Mr. Beauclerk&rsquo;s, where I supped, was Mr. Garrick, whom I made happy with Johnson&rsquo;s praise of his prologues; and I suppose, in gratitude to him, he took up one of his favourite topicks, the nationality of the Scotch, which he maintained in a pleasant manner, with the aid of a little poetical fiction. &lsquo;Come, come, don&rsquo;t deny it: they are really national. Why, now, the Adams are as liberal-minded men as any in the world: but, I don&rsquo;t know how it is, all their workmen are Scotch. You are, to be sure, wonderfully free from that nationality: but so it happens, that you employ the only Scotch shoe-black in London.&rsquo; He imitated the manner of his old master with ludicrous exaggeration; repeating, with pauses and half-whistlings interjected,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Os homini sublime dedit, &mdash; caelumque tueri</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jussit, &mdash; et erectos ad sidera &mdash; tollere vultus&rsquo;;</p>
<p class="p24">looking downwards all the time, and, while pronouncing the four last words, absolutely touching the ground with a kind of contorted gesticulation.</p>
<p class="p24">Garrick, however, when he pleased, could imitate Johnson very exactly; for that great actor, with his distinguished powers of expression which were so universally admired, possessed also an admirable talent of mimickry. He was always jealous that Johnson spoke lightly of him. I recollect his exhibiting him to me one day, as if saying, &lsquo;Davy has some convivial pleasantry about him, but &rsquo;tis a futile fellow;&rsquo; which he uttered perfectly with the tone and air of Johnson.</p>
<p class="p24">I cannot too frequently request of my readers, while they peruse my account of Johnson&rsquo;s conversation, to endeavour to keep in mind his deliberate and strong utterance. His mode of speaking was indeed very impressive; and I wish it could be preserved as musick is written, according to the very ingenious method of Mr. Steele, who has shewn how the recitation of Mr. Garrick, and other eminent speakers, might be transmitted to posterity IN SCORE.</p>
<p class="p24">Next day I dined with Johnson at Mr. Thrale&rsquo;s. He attacked Gray, calling him &lsquo;a dull fellow.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;I understand he was reserved, and might appear dull in company; but surely he was not dull in poetry.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, he was dull in company, dull in his closet, dull every where. He was dull in a new way, and that made many people think him GREAT. He was a mechanical poet.&rsquo; He then repeated some ludicrous lines, which have escaped my memory, and said, &lsquo;Is not that GREAT, like his Odes?&rsquo; Mrs. Thrale maintained that his Odes were melodious; upon which he exclaimed,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Weave the warp, and weave the woof;&rsquo; &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">I added, in a solemn tone,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The winding-sheet of Edward&rsquo;s race.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;THERE is a good line.&rsquo; &lsquo;Ay, (said he,) and the next line is a good one,&rsquo; (pronouncing it contemptuously;)</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Give ample verge and room enough.&rsquo; &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;No, Sir, there are but two good stanzas in Gray&rsquo;s poetry, which are in his Elegy in a Country Church-yard.&rsquo; He then repeated the stanza,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;For who to dumb forgetfulness a prey,&rsquo; &amp;c.</p>
<p class="p24">mistaking one word; for instead of precincts he said confines. He added, &lsquo;The other stanza I forget.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">A young lady who had married a man much her inferiour in rank being mentioned, a question arose how a woman&rsquo;s relations should behave to her in such a situation; and, while I recapitulate the debate, and recollect what has since happened, I cannot but be struck in a manner that delicacy forbids me to express. While I contended that she ought to be treated with an inflexible steadiness of displeasure, Mrs. Thrale was all for mildness and forgiveness, and, according to the vulgar phrase, &lsquo;making the best of a bad bargain.&rsquo; JOHNSON. Madam, we must distinguish. Were I a man of rank, I would not let a daughter starve who had made a mean marriage; but having voluntarily degraded herself from the station which she was originally entitled to hold, I would support her only in that which she herself had chosen; and would not put her on a level with my other daughters. You are to consider, Madam, that it is our duty to maintain the subordination of civilized society; and when there is a gross and shameful deviation from rank, it should be punished so as to deter others from the same perversion.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Friday, March 31, I supped with him and some friends at a tavern. One of the company* attempted, with too much forwardness, to rally him on his late appearance at the theatre; but had reason to repent of his temerity. &lsquo;Why, Sir, did you go to Mrs. Abington&rsquo;s benefit? Did you see?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;No, Sir.&rsquo; &lsquo;Did you hear?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;No, Sir.&rsquo; &lsquo;Why then, Sir, did you go?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Because, Sir, she is a favourite of the publick; and when the publick cares the thousandth part for you that it does for her, I will go to your benefit too.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Very likely Boswell. &mdash; HILL.</p>
<p class="p24">Next morning I won a small bet from Lady Diana Beauclerk, by asking him as to one of his particularities, which her Ladyship laid I durst not do. It seems he had been frequently observed at the Club to put into his pocket the Seville oranges, after he had squeezed the juice of them into the drink which he made for himself. Beauclerk and Garrick talked of it to me, and seemed to think that he had a strange unwillingness to be discovered. We could not divine what he did with them; and this was the bold question to be put. I saw on his table the spoils of the preceding night, some fresh peels nicely scraped and cut into pieces. &lsquo;O, Sir, (said I,) I now partly see what you do with the squeezed oranges which you put into your pocket at the Club.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;I have a great love for them.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;And pray, Sir, what do you do with them? You scrape them, it seems, very neatly, and what next?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Let them dry, Sir.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;And what next?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Nay, Sir, you shall know their fate no further.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Then the world must be left in the dark. It must be said (assuming a mock solemnity,) he scraped them, and let them dry, but what he did with them next, he never could be prevailed upon to tell.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Nay, Sir, you should say it more emphatically: &mdash; he could not be prevailed upon, even by his dearest friends, to tell.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He had this morning received his Diploma as Doctor of Laws from the University of Oxford. He did not vaunt of his new dignity, but I understood he was highly pleased with it.</p>
<p class="p24">I observed to him that there were very few of his friends so accurate as that I could venture to put down in writing what they told me as his sayings. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why should you write down MY sayings?&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;I write them when they are good.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Nay, you may as well write down the sayings of any one else that are good.&rsquo; But WHERE, I might with great propriety have added, can I find such?</p>
<p class="p24">Next day, Sunday, April 2, I dined with him at Mr. Hoole&rsquo;s. We talked of Pope. JOHNSON. &lsquo;He wrote, his Dunciad for fame. That was his primary motive. Had it not been for that, the dunces might have railed against him till they were weary, without his troubling himself about them. He delighted to vex them, no doubt; but he had more delight in seeing how well he could vex them.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">His Taxation no Tyranny being mentioned, he said, &lsquo;I think I have not been attacked enough for it. Attack is the re-action; I never think I have hit hard, unless it rebounds.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know, Sir, what you would be at. Five or six shots of small arms in every newspaper, and repeated cannonading in pamphlets, might, I think, satisfy you. But, Sir, you&rsquo;ll never make out this match, of which we have talked, with a certain political lady,* since you are so severe against her principles.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Nay, Sir, I have the better chance for that. She is like the Amazons of old; she must be courted by the sword. But I have not been severe upon her.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Yes, Sir, you have made her ridiculous.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;That was already done, Sir. To endeavour to make HER ridiculous, is like blacking the chimney.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Croker identifies her as Mrs. Macaulay.&nbsp; See p. 119. &mdash; ED.</p>
<p class="p24">I talked of the cheerfulness of Fleet-street, owing to the constant quick succession of people which we perceive passing through it. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, Fleet-street has a very animated appearance; but I think the full tide of human existence is at Charing-cross.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He made the common remark on the unhappiness which men who have led a busy life experience, when they retire in expectation of enjoying themselves at ease, and that they generally languish for want of their habitual occupation, and wish to return to it. He mentioned as strong an instance of this as can well be imagined. &lsquo;An eminent tallow-chandler in London, who had acquired a considerable fortune, gave up the trade in favour of his foreman, and went to live at a country-house near town. He soon grew weary, and paid frequent visits to his old shop, where he desired they might let him know their melting-days, and he would come and assist them; which he accordingly did. Here, Sir, was a man, to whom the most disgusting circumstance in the business to which he had been used was a relief from idleness.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Wednesday, April 5, I dined with him at Messieurs Dilly&rsquo;s, with Mr. John Scott of Amwell, the Quaker, Mr. Langton, Mr. Miller, (now Sir John,) and Dr. Thomas Campbell, an Irish clergyman, whom I took the liberty of inviting to Mr. Dilly&rsquo;s table, having seen him at Mr. Thrale&rsquo;s, and been told that he had come to England chiefly with a view to see Dr. Johnson, for whom he entertained the highest veneration. He has since published A Philosophical Survey of the South of Ireland, a very entertaining book, which has, however, one fault; &mdash; that it assumes the fictitious character of an Englishman.</p>
<p class="p24">We talked of publick speaking &mdash; JOHNSON. &lsquo;We must not estimate a man&rsquo;s powers by his being able, or not able to deliver his sentiments in publick. Isaac Hawkins Browne, one of the first wits of this country, got into Parliament, and never opened his mouth. For my own part, I think it is more disgraceful never to try to speak, than to try it and fail; as it is more disgraceful not to fight, than to fight and be beaten.&rsquo; This argument appeared to me fallacious; for if a man has not spoken, it may be said that he would have done very well it he had tried; whereas, if he has tried and failed, there is nothing to be said for him. &lsquo;Why then, (I asked,) is it thought disgraceful for a man not to fight, and not disgraceful not to speak in publick?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Because there may be other reasons for a man&rsquo;s not speaking in publick than want of resolution: he may have nothing to say, (laughing.) Whereas, Sir, you know courage is reckoned the greatest of all virtues; because, unless a man has that virtue, he has no security for preserving any other.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Thursday, April 6, I dined with him at Mr. Thomas Davies&rsquo;s, with Mr. Hicky, the painter, and my old acquaintance Mr. Moody, the player.</p>
<p class="p24">Dr. Johnson, as usual, spoke contemptuously of Colley Cibber. &lsquo;It is wonderful that a man, who for forty years had lived with the great and the witty, should have acquired so ill the talents of conversation: and he had but half to furnish; for one half of what he said was oaths.&rsquo; He, however, allowed considerable merit to some of his comedies, and said there was no reason to believe that the Careless Husband was not written by himself. Davies said, he was the first dramatick writer who introduced genteel ladies upon the stage. Johnson refuted this observation by instancing several such characters in comedies before his time. DAVIES. (trying to defend himself from a charge of ignorance,) &lsquo;I mean genteel moral characters.&rsquo; &lsquo;I think (said Hicky,) gentility and morality are inseparable.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;By no means, Sir. The genteelest characters are often the most immoral. Does not Lord Chesterfield give precepts for uniting wickedness and the graces? A man, indeed, is not genteel when he gets drunk; but most vices may be committed very genteelly: a man may debauch his friend&rsquo;s wife genteelly: he may cheat at cards genteelly.&rsquo; HICKY. &lsquo;I do not think THAT is genteel.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Sir, it may not be like a gentleman, but it may be genteel.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;You are meaning two different things. One means exteriour grace; the other honour. It is certain that a man may be very immoral with exteriour grace. Lovelace, in Clarissa, is a very genteel and a very wicked character. Tom Hervey, who died t&rsquo;other day, though a vicious man, was one of the genteelest men that ever lived.&rsquo; Tom Davies instanced Charles the Second. JOHNSON. (taking fire at any attack upon that Prince, for whom he had an extraordinary partiality,) &lsquo;Charles the Second was licentious in his practice; but he always had a reverence for what was good. Charles the Second knew his people, and rewarded merit. The Church was at no time better filled than in his reign. He was the best King we have had from his time till the reign of his present Majesty, except James the Second, who was a very good King, but unhappily believed that it was necessary for the salvation of his subjects that they should be Roman Catholicks. HE had the merit of endeavouring to do what he thought was for the salvation of the souls of his subjects, till he lost a great Empire. WE, who thought that we should NOT be saved if we were Roman Catholicks, had the merit of maintaining our religion, at the expence of submitting ourselves to the government of King William, (for it could not be done otherwise,) &mdash; to the government of one of the most worthless scoundrels that ever existed. No; Charles the Second was not such a man as &mdash;&mdash; , (naming another King). He did not destroy his father&rsquo;s will. He took money, indeed, from France: but he did not betray those over whom he ruled: he did not let the French fleet pass ours. George the First knew nothing, and desired to know nothing; did nothing, and desired to do nothing: and the only good thing that is told of him is, that he wished to restore the crown to its hereditary successor.&rsquo; He roared with prodigious violence against George the Second. When he ceased, Moody interjected, in an Irish tone, and with a comick look, &lsquo;Ah! poor George the Second.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I mentioned that Dr. Thomas Campbell had come from Ireland to London, principally to see Dr. Johnson. He seemed angry at this observation. DAVIES. &lsquo;Why, you know, Sir, there came a man from Spain to see Livy; and Corelli came to England to see Purcell, and when he heard he was dead, went directly back again to Italy.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;I should not have wished to be dead to disappoint Campbell, had he been so foolish as you represent him; but I should have wished to have been a hundred miles off.&rsquo; This was apparently perverse; and I do believe it was not his real way of thinking: he could not but like a man who came so far to see him. He laughed with some complacency, when I told him Campbell&rsquo;s odd expression to me concerning him: &lsquo;That having seen such a man, was a thing to talk of a century hence,&rsquo; &mdash; as if he could live so long.</p>
<p class="p24">We got into an argument whether the Judges who went to India might with propriety engage in trade. Johnson warmly maintained that they might. &lsquo;For why (he urged,) should not Judges get riches, as well as those who deserve them less?&rsquo; I said, they should have sufficient salaries, and have nothing to take off their attention from the affairs of the publick. JOHNSON. &lsquo;No Judge, Sir, can give his whole attention to his office; and it is very proper that he should employ what time he has to himself, to his own advantage, in the most profitable manner.&rsquo; &lsquo;Then, Sir, (said Davies, who enlivened the dispute by making it somewhat dramatick,) he may become an insurer; and when he is going to the bench, he may be stopped,&mdash; &ldquo;Your Lordship cannot go yet: here is a bunch of invoices: several ships are about to sail.&rdquo;&rsquo; JOHNSON. Sir, you may as well say a Judge should not have a house; for they may come and tell him, &ldquo;Your Lordship&rsquo;s house is on fire;&rdquo; and so, instead of minding the business of his Court, he is to be occupied in getting the engine with the greatest speed. There is no end of this. Every Judge who has land, trades to a certain extent in corn or in cattle; and in the land itself, undoubtedly. His steward acts for him, and so do clerks for a great merchant. A Judge may be a farmer; but he is not to geld his own pigs. A Judge may play a little at cards for his amusement; but he is not to play at marbles, or at chuck-farthing in the Piazza. No, Sir; there is no profession to which a man gives a very great proportion of his time. It is wonderful, when a calculation is made, how little the mind is actually employed in the discharge of any profession. No man would be a Judge, upon the condition of being totally a Judge. The best employed lawyer has his mind at work but for a small proportion of his time; a great deal of his occupation is merely mechanical. I once wrote for a magazine: I made a calculation, that if I should write but a page a day, at the same rate, I should, in ten years, write nine volumes in folio, of an ordinary size and print.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Such as Carte&rsquo;s History?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Yes, Sir. When a man writes from his own mind, he writes very rapidly. The greatest part of a writer&rsquo;s time is spent in reading, in order to write: a man will turn over half a library to make one book.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">We spoke of Rolt, to whose Dictionary of Commerce Dr. Johnson wrote the Preface. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Old Gardner the bookseller employed Rolt and Smart to write a monthly miscellany, called The Universal Visitor. There was a formal written contract, which Allen the printer saw. Gardner thought as you do of the Judge. They were bound to write nothing else; they were to have, I think, a third of the profits of this sixpenny pamphlet; and the contract was for ninety-nine years. I wish I had thought of giving this to Thurlow, in the cause about Literary Property. What an excellent instance would it have been of the oppression of booksellers towards poor authours!&rsquo; (smiling.) Davies, zealous for the honour of THE TRADE, said, Gardner was not properly a bookseller. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Nay, Sir; he certainly was a bookseller. He had served his time regularly, was a member of the Stationers&rsquo; company, kept a shop in the face of mankind, purchased copyright, and was a bibliopole, Sir, in every sense. I wrote for some months in The Universal Visitor, for poor Smart, while he was mad, not then knowing the terms on which he was engaged to write, and thinking I was doing him good. I hoped his wits would soon return to him. Mine returned to me, and I wrote in The Universal Visitor no longer.</p>
<p class="p24">Friday, April 7, I dined with him at a Tavern, with a numerous company.</p>
<p class="p24">One of the company suggested an internal objection to the antiquity of the poetry said to be Ossian&rsquo;s, that we do not find the wolf in it, which must have been the case had it been of that age.</p>
<p class="p24">The mention of the wolf had led Johnson to think of other wild beasts; and while Sir Joshua Reynolds and Mr. Langton were carrying on a dialogue about something which engaged them earnestly, he, in the midst of it, broke out, &lsquo;Pennant tells of Bears&mdash; &lsquo; [what he added, I have forgotten.] They went on, which he being dull of hearing, did not perceive, or, if he did, was not willing to break off his talk; so he continued to vociferate his remarks, and BEAR (&lsquo;like a word in a catch&rsquo; as Beauclerk said,) was repeatedly heard at intervals, which coming from him who, by those who did not know him, had been so often assimilated to that ferocious animal, while we who were sitting around could hardly stifle laughter, produced a very ludicrous effect. Silence having ensued, he proceeded: &lsquo;We are told, that the black bear is innocent; but I should not like to trust myself with him.&rsquo; Mr. Gibbon muttered, in a low tone of voice, &lsquo;I should not like to trust myself with YOU.&rsquo; This piece of sarcastick pleasantry was a prudent resolution, if applied to a competition of abilities.</p>
<p class="p24">Patriotism having become one of our topicks, Johnson suddenly uttered, in a strong determined tone, an apophthegm, at which many will start: &lsquo;Patriotism is the last refuge of a scoundrel.&rsquo; But let it be considered, that he did not mean a real and generous love of our country, but that pretended patriotism which so many, in all ages and countries, have made a cloak for self-interest.</p>
<p class="p24">Mrs. Prichard being mentioned, he said, &lsquo;Her playing was quite mechanical. It is wonderful how little mind she had. Sir, she had never read the tragedy of Macbeth all through. She no more thought of the play out of which her part was taken, than a shoemaker thinks of the skin, out of which the piece of leather, of which he is making a pair of shoes, is cut.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Saturday, April 8, I dined with him at Mr. Thrale&rsquo;s, where we met the Irish Dr. Campbell. Johnson had supped the night before at Mrs. Abington&rsquo;s, with some fashionable people whom he named; and he seemed much pleased with having made one in so elegant a circle. Nor did he omit to pique his MISTRESS a little with jealousy of her housewifery; for he said, (with a smile,) &lsquo;Mrs. Abington&rsquo;s jelly, my dear lady, was better than yours.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Mrs. Thrale, who frequently practised a coarse mode of flattery, by repeating his bon-mots in his hearing, told us that he had said, a certain celebrated actor was just fit to stand at the door of an auction-room with a long pole, and cry &lsquo;Pray gentlemen, walk in;&rsquo; and that a certain authour, upon hearing this, had said, that another still more celebrated actor was fit for nothing better than that, and would pick your pocket after you came out. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Nay, my dear lady, there is no wit in what our friend added; there is only abuse. You may as well say of any man that he will pick a pocket. Besides, the man who is stationed at the door does not pick people&rsquo;s pockets; that is done within, by the auctioneer.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Monday, April 10, I dined with him at General Oglethorpe&rsquo;s, with Mr. Langton and the Irish Dr. Campbell, whom the General had obligingly given me leave to bring with me. This learned gentleman was thus gratified with a very high intellectual feast, by not only being in company with Dr. Johnson, but with General Oglethorpe, who had been so long a celebrated name both at home and abroad.</p>
<p class="p24">I must, again and again, intreat of my readers not to suppose that my imperfect record of conversation contains the whole of what was said by Johnson, or other eminent persons who lived with him. What I have preserved, however, has the value of the most perfect authenticity.</p>
<p class="p24">He urged General Oglethorpe to give the world his Life. He said, &lsquo;I know no man whose Life would be more interesting. If I were furnished with materials, I should be very glad to write it.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Mr. Scott of Amwell&rsquo;s Elegies were lying in the room. Dr. Johnson observed, &lsquo;They are very well; but such as twenty people might write.&rsquo; Upon this I took occasion to controvert Horace&rsquo;s maxim,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo; &mdash;&mdash;&nbsp; &mdash; mediocribus esse poetis</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Non Di, non homines, non concessere columnae.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">For here, (I observed,) was a very middle-rate poet, who pleased many readers, and therefore poetry of a middle sort was entitled to some esteem; nor could I see why poetry should not, like every thing else, have different gradations of excellence, and consequently of value. Johnson repeated the common remark, that, &lsquo;as there is no necessity for our having poetry at all, it being merely a luxury, an instrument of pleasure, it can have no value, unless when exquisite in its kind.&rsquo; I declared myself not satisfied. &lsquo;Why then, Sir, (said he,) Horace and you must settle it.&rsquo; He was not much in the humour of talking.</p>
<p class="p24">No more of his conversation for some days appears in my journal, except that when a gentleman told him he had bought a suit of lace for his lady, he said, &lsquo;Well, Sir, you have done a good thing and a wise thing.&rsquo; &lsquo;I have done a good thing, (said the gentleman,) but I do not know that I have done a wise thing.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Yes, Sir; no money is better spent than what is laid out for domestick satisfaction. A man is pleased that his wife is drest as well as other people; and a wife is pleased that she is drest.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Friday, April 14, being Good-Friday, I repaired to him in the morning, according to my usual custom on that day, and breakfasted with him. I observed that he fasted so very strictly, that he did not even taste bread, and took no milk with his tea; I suppose because it is a kind of animal food.</p>
<p class="p24">I told him that I had been informed by Mr. Orme, that many parts of the East-Indies were better mapped than the Highlands of Scotland. JOHNSON. &lsquo;That a country may be mapped, it must be travelled over.&rsquo; &lsquo;Nay, (said I, meaning to laugh with him at one of his prejudices,) can&rsquo;t you say, it is not WORTH mapping?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">As we walked to St. Clement&rsquo;s church, and saw several shops open upon this most solemn fast-day of the Christian world, I remarked, that one disadvantage arising from the immensity of London, was, that nobody was heeded by his neighbour; there was no fear of censure for not observing Good-Friday, as it ought to be kept, and as it is kept in country-towns. He said, it was, upon the whole, very well observed even in London. He, however, owned, that London was too large; but added, &lsquo;It is nonsense to say the head is too big for the body. It would be as much too big, though the body were ever so large; that is to say, though the country were ever so extensive. It has no similarity to a head connected with a body.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Dr. Wetherell, Master of University College, Oxford, accompanied us home from church; and after he was gone, there came two other gentlemen, one of whom uttered the commonplace complaints, that by the increase of taxes, labour would be dear, other nations would undersell us, and our commerce would be ruined. JOHNSON. (smiling,) &lsquo;Never fear, Sir. Our commerce is in a very good state; and suppose we had no commerce at all, we could live very well on the produce of our own country.&rsquo; I cannot omit to mention, that I never knew any man who was less disposed to be querulous than Johnson. Whether the subject was his own situation, or the state of the publick, or the state of human nature in general, though he saw the evils, his mind was turned to resolution, and never to whining or complaint.</p>
<p class="p24">We went again to St. Clement&rsquo;s in the afternoon. He had found fault with the preacher in the morning for not choosing a text adapted to the day. The preacher in the afternoon had chosen one extremely proper: &lsquo;It is finished.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">After the evening service, he said, &lsquo;Come, you shall go home with me, and sit just an hour.&rsquo; But he was better than his word; for after we had drunk tea with Mrs. Williams, he asked me to go up to his study with him, where we sat a long while together in a serene undisturbed frame of mind, sometimes in silence, and sometimes conversing, as we felt ourselves inclined, or more properly speaking, as HE was inclined; for during all the course of my long intimacy with him, my respectful attention never abated, and my wish to hear him was such, that I constantly watched every dawning of communication from that great and illuminated mind.</p>
<p class="p24">He again advised me to keep a journal fully and minutely, but not to mention such trifles as, that meat was too much or too little done, or that the weather was fair or rainy. He had, till very near his death, a contempt for the notion that the weather affects the human frame.</p>
<p class="p24">I told him that our friend Goldsmith had said to me, that he had come too late into the world, for that Pope and other poets had taken up the places in the Temple of Fame; so that, as but a few at any period can possess poetical reputation, a man of genius can now hardly acquire it. JOHNSON. &lsquo;That is one of the most sensible things I have ever heard of Goldsmith. It is difficult to get literary fame, and it is every day growing more difficult. Ah, Sir, that should make a man think of securing happiness in another world, which all who try sincerely for it may attain. In comparison of that, how little are all other things! The belief of immortality is impressed upon all men, and all men act under an impression of it, however they may talk, and though, perhaps, they may be scarcely sensible of it.&rsquo; I said, it appeared to me that some people had not the least notion of immortality; and I mentioned a distinguished gentleman of our acquaintance. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, if it were not for the notion of immortality, he would cut a throat to fill his pockets.&rsquo; When I quoted this to Beauclerk, who knew much more of the gentleman than we did, he said, in his acid manner, &lsquo;He would cut a throat to fill his pockets, if it were not for fear of being hanged.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He was pleased to say, &lsquo;If you come to settle here, we will have one day in the week on which we will meet by ourselves. That is the happiest conversation where there is no competition, no vanity, but a calm quiet interchange of sentiments.&rsquo; In his private register this evening is thus marked, &lsquo;Boswell sat with me till night; we had some serious talk.&rsquo; It also appears from the same record, that after I left him he was occupied in religious duties, in &lsquo;giving Francis, his servant, some directions for preparation to communicate; in reviewing his life, and resolving on better conduct.&rsquo; The humility and piety which he discovers on such occasions, is truely edifying. No saint, however, in the course of his religious warfare, was more sensible of the unhappy failure of pious resolves, than Johnson. He said one day, talking to an acquaintance on this subject, &lsquo;Sir Hell is paved with good intentions.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Sunday, April 16, being Easter Day, after having attended the solemn service at St. Paul&rsquo;s, I dined with Dr. Johnson and Mrs. Williams. I maintained that Horace was wrong in placing happiness in Nil admirari, for that I thought admiration one of the most agreeable of all our feelings; and I regretted that I had lost much of my disposition to admire, which people generally do as they advance in life. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, as a man advances in life, he gets what is better than admiration &mdash; judgement, to estimate things at their true value.&rsquo; I still insisted that admiration was more pleasing than judgement, as love is more pleasing than friendship. The feeling of friendship is like that of being comfortably filled with roast beef; love, like being enlivened with champagne. JOHNSON. &lsquo;No, Sir; admiration and love are like being intoxicated with champagne; judgement and friendship like being enlivened. Waller has hit upon the same thought with you: but I don&rsquo;t believe you have borrowed from Waller. I wish you would enable yourself to borrow more.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He then took occasion to enlarge on the advantages of reading, and combated the idle superficial notion, that knowledge enough may be acquired in conversation. &lsquo;The foundation (said he,) must be laid by reading. General principles must be had from books, which, however, must be brought to the test of real life. In conversation you never get a system. What is said upon a subject is to be gathered from a hundred people. The parts of a truth, which a man gets thus, are at such a distance from each other that he never attains to a full view.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Tuesday, April 15, he and I were engaged to go with Sir Joshua Reynolds to dine with Mr. Cambridge, at his beautiful villa on the banks of the Thames, near Twickenham. Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s tardiness was such, that Sir Joshua, who had an appointment at Richmond, early in the day, was obliged to go by himself on horseback, leaving his coach to Johnson and me. Johnson was in such good spirits, that every thing seemed to please him as we drove along.</p>
<p class="p24">Our conversation turned on a variety of subjects. He thought portrait-painting an improper employment for a woman. &lsquo;Publick practice of any art, (he observed,) and staring in men&rsquo;s faces, is very indelicate in a female.&rsquo; I happened to start a question, whether, when a man knows that some of his intimate friends are invited to the house of another friend, with whom they are all equally intimate, he may join them without an invitation. JOHNSON. &lsquo;No, Sir; he is not to go when he is not invited. They may be invited on purpose to abuse him&rsquo; (smiling).</p>
<p class="p24">As a curious instance how little a man knows, or wishes to know, his own character in the world, or, rather, as a convincing proof that Johnson&rsquo;s roughness was only external, and did not proceed from his heart, I insert the following dialogue. JOHNSON. &lsquo;It is wonderful, Sir, how rare a quality good humour is in life. We meet with very few good humoured men.&rsquo; I mentioned four of our friends, none of whom he would allow to be good humoured. One was ACID, another was MUDDY, and to the others he had objections which have escaped me. Then, shaking his head and stretching himself at ease in the coach, and smiling with much complacency, he turned to me and said, &lsquo;I look upon MYSELF as a good humoured fellow.&rsquo; The epithet FELLOW, applied to the great Lexicographer, the stately Moralist, the masterly critick, as if he had been SAM Johnson, a mere pleasant companion, was highly diverting; and this light notion of himself struck me with wonder. I answered, also smiling, &lsquo;No, no, Sir; that will NOT do. You are good natured, but not good humoured: you are irascible. You have not patience with folly and absurdity. I believe you would pardon them, if there were time to deprecate your vengeance; but punishment follows so quick after sentence, that they cannot escape.</p>
<p class="p24">I had brought with me a great bundle of Scotch magazines and news-papers, in which his Journey to the Western Islands was attacked in every mode; and I read a great part of them to him, knowing they would afford him entertainment. I wish the writers of them had been present: they would have been sufficiently vexed. One ludicrous imitation of his style, by Mr. Maclaurin, now one of the Scotch Judges, with the title of Lord Dreghorn, was distinguished by him from the rude mass. &lsquo;This (said he,) is the best. But I could caricature my own style much better myself.&rsquo; He defended his remark upon the general insufficiency of education in Scotland; and confirmed to me the authenticity of his witty saying on the learning of the Scotch;&mdash; &lsquo;Their learning is like bread in a besieged town: every man gets a little, but no man gets a full meal.&rsquo; &lsquo;There is (said he,) in Scotland, a diffusion of learning, a certain portion of it widely and thinly spread. A merchant there has as much learning as one of their clergy.</p>
<p class="p24">No sooner had we made our bow to Mr. Cambridge, in his library, than Johnson ran eagerly to one side of the room, intent on poring over the backs of the books. Sir Joshua observed, (aside,) &lsquo;He runs to the books, as I do to the pictures: but I have the advantage. I can see much more of the pictures than he can of the books.&rsquo; Mr. Cambridge, upon this, politely said, &lsquo;Dr. Johnson, I am going, with your pardon, to accuse myself, for I have the same custom which I perceive you have. But it seems odd that one should have such a desire to look at the backs of books.&rsquo; Johnson, ever ready for contest, instantly started from his reverie, wheeled about, and answered, &lsquo;Sir, the reason is very plain. Knowledge is of two kinds. We know a subject ourselves, or we know where we can find information upon it. When we enquire into any subject, the first thing we have to do is to know what books have treated of it. This leads us to look at catalogues, and the backs of books in libraries.&rsquo; Sir Joshua observed to me the extraordinary promptitude with which Johnson flew upon an argument. &lsquo;Yes, (said I,) he has no formal preparation, no flourishing with his sword; he is through your body in an instant.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson was here solaced with an elegant entertainment, a very accomplished family, and much good company; among whom was Mr. Harris of Salisbury, who paid him many compliments on his Journey to the Western Islands.</p>
<p class="p24">The common remark as to the utility of reading history being made; &mdash; JOHNSON. &lsquo;We must consider how very little history there is; I mean real authentick history. That certain Kings reigned, and certain battles were fought, we can depend upon as true; but all the colouring, all the philosophy of history is conjecture.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Then, Sir, you would reduce all history to no better than an almanack, a mere chronological series of remarkable events.&rsquo; Mr. Gibbon, who must at that time have been employed upon his History, of which he published the first volume in the following year, was present; but did not step forth in defence of that species of writing. He probably did not like to TRUST himself with JOHNSON!</p>
<p class="p24">The Beggar&rsquo;s Opera, and the common question, whether it was pernicious in its effects, having been introduced; &mdash; JOHNSON. &lsquo;As to this matter, which has been very much contested, I myself am of opinion, that more influence has been ascribed to The Beggar&rsquo;s Opera, than it in reality ever had; for I do not believe that any man was ever made a rogue by being present at its representation. At the same time I do not deny that it may have some influence, by making the character of a rogue familiar, and in some degree pleasing.&rsquo; Then collecting himself as it were, to give a heavy stroke: &lsquo;There is in it such a LABEFACTATION of all principles, as may be injurious to morality.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">While he pronounced this response, we sat in a comical sort of restraint, smothering a laugh, which we were afraid might burst out.</p>
<p class="p24">We talked of a young gentleman&rsquo;s* marriage with an eminent singer, and his determination that she should no longer sing in publick, though his father was very earnest she should, because her talents would be liberally rewarded, so as to make her a good fortune. It was questioned whether the young gentleman, who had not a shilling in the world, but was blest with very uncommon talents, was not foolishly delicate, or foolishly proud, and his father truely rational without being mean. Johnson, with all the high spirit of a Roman senator, exclaimed, &lsquo;He resolved wisely and nobly to be sure. He is a brave man. Would not a gentleman be disgraced by having his wife singing publickly for hire? No, Sir, there can be no doubt here. I know not if I should not PREPARE myself for a publick singer, as readily as let my wife be one.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Probably Richard Brinsley Sheridan, whose romantic</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;marriage with the beautiful Elizabeth Linley took place in</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1773.&nbsp; He became a member of the Club on Johnson&rsquo;s proposal.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See below, p. 325. &mdash; ED.</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson arraigned the modern politicks of this country, as entirely devoid of all principle of whatever kind. &lsquo;Politicks (said he,) are now nothing more than means of rising in the world. With this sole view do men engage in politicks, and their whole conduct proceeds upon it.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Somebody found fault with writing verses in a dead language, maintaining that they were merely arrangements of so many words, and laughed at the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge, for sending forth collections of them not only in Greek and Latin, but even in Syriac, Arabick, and other more unknown tongues. JOHNSON. &lsquo;I would have as many of these as possible; I would have verses in every language that there are the means of acquiring. Nobody imagines that an University is to have at once two hundred poets; but it should be able to show two hundred scholars. Pieresc&rsquo;s death was lamented, I think, in forty languages. And I would have had at every coronation, and every death of a King, every Gaudium, and every Luctus, University verses, in as many languages as can be acquired. I would have the world to be thus told, &ldquo;Here is a school where every thing may be learnt.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Having set out next day on a visit to the Earl of Pembroke, at Wilton, and to my friend, Mr. Temple, at Mamhead, in Devonshire, and not having returned to town till the second of May, I did not see Dr. Johnson for a considerable time, and during the remaining part of my stay in London, kept very imperfect notes of his conversation, which had I according to my usual custom written out at large soon after the time, much might have been preserved, which is now irretrievably lost.</p>
<p class="p24">On Monday, May 8, we went together and visited the mansions of Bedlam. I had been informed that he had once been there before with Mr. Wedderburne, (now Lord Loughborough,) Mr. Murphy, and Mr. Foote; and I had heard Foote give a very entertaining account of Johnson&rsquo;s happening to have his attention arrested by a man who was very furious, and who, while beating his straw, supposed it was William Duke of Cumberland, whom he was punishing for his cruelties in Scotland, in 1746. There was nothing peculiarly remarkable this day; but the general contemplation of insanity was very affecting. I accompanied him home, and dined and drank tea with him.</p>
<p class="p24">On Friday, May 12, as he had been so good as to assign me a room in his house, where I might sleep occasionally, when I happened to sit with him to a late hour, I took possession of it this night, found every thing in excellent order, and was attended by honest Francis with a most civil assiduity. I asked Johnson whether I might go to a consultation with another lawyer upon Sunday, as that appeared to me to be doing work as much in my way, as if an artisan should work on the day appropriated for religious rest. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, when you are of consequence enough to oppose the practice of consulting upon Sunday, you should do it: but you may go now. It is not criminal, though it is not what one should do, who is anxious for the preservation and increase of piety, to which a peculiar observance of Sunday is a great help. The distinction is clear between what is of moral and what is of ritual obligation.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Saturday, May 13, I breakfasted with him by invitation, accompanied by Mr. Andrew Crosbie, a Scotch Advocate, whom he had seen at Edinburgh, and the Hon. Colonel (now General) Edward Stopford, brother to Lord Courtown, who was desirous of being introduced to him. His tea and rolls and butter, and whole breakfast apparatus were all in such decorum, and his behaviour was so courteous, that Colonel Stopford was quite surprized, and wondered at his having heard so much said of Johnson&rsquo;s slovenliness and roughness.</p>
<p class="p24">I passed many hours with him on the 17th, of which I find all my memorial is, &lsquo;much laughing.&rsquo; It should seem he had that day been in a humour for jocularity and merriment, and upon such occasions I never knew a man laugh more heartily. We may suppose, that the high relish of a state so different from his habitual gloom, produced more than ordinary exertions of that distinguishing faculty of man, which has puzzled philosophers so much to explain. Johnson&rsquo;s laugh was as remarkable as any circumstance in his manner. It was a kind of good humoured growl. Tom Davies described it drolly enough: &lsquo;He laughs like a rhinoceros.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;TO BENNET LANGTON, ESQ.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;DEAR SIR, &mdash; I have an old amanuensis in great distress. I have given what I think I can give, and begged till I cannot tell where to beg again. I put into his hands this morning four guineas. If you could collect three guineas more, it would clear him from his present difficulty. I am, Sir, your most humble servant,</p>

<p class="p24">After my return to Scotland, I wrote three letters to him.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;TO JAMES BOSWELL, ESQ.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;DEAR SIR, &mdash; I am returned from the annual ramble into the middle counties. Having seen nothing I had not seen before, I have nothing to relate. Time has left that part of the island few antiquities; and commerce has left the people no singularities. I was glad to go abroad, and, perhaps, glad to come home; which is, in other words, I was, I am afraid, weary of being at home, and weary of being abroad. Is not this the state of life? But, if we confess this weariness, let us not lament it, for all the wise and all the good say, that we may cure it. . . .</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Mrs. Thrale was so entertained with your Journal,* that she almost read herself blind. She has a great regard for you.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Of Mrs. Boswell, though she knows in her heart that she does not love me, I am always glad to hear any good, and hope that she and the little dear ladies will have neither sickness nor any other affliction. But she knows that she does not care what becomes of me, and for that she may be sure that I think her very much to blame.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Never, my dear Sir, do you take it into your head to think that I do not love you; you may settle yourself in full confidence both of my love and my esteem; I love you as a kind man, I value you as a worthy man, and hope in time to reverence you as a man of exemplary piety. I hold you, as Hamlet has it, &ldquo;in my heart of hearts,&rdquo; and therefore, it is little to say, that I am, Sir, your affectionate humble servant,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;London, Aug. 27, 1775.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* My Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides, which that lady read</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the original manuscript. &mdash; BOSWELL.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;TO MR. ROBERT LEVET.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Paris,* Oct. 22, 1775.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;DEAR SIR, &mdash; We are still here, commonly very busy in looking about us. We have been to-day at Versailles. You have seen it, and I shall not describe it. We came yesterday from Fontainbleau, where the Court is now. We went to see the King and Queen at dinner, and the Queen was so impressed by Miss,** that she sent one of the Gentlemen to enquire who she was. I find all true that you have ever told me of Paris. Mr. Thrale is very liberal, and keeps us two coaches, and a very fine table; but I think our cookery very bad. Mrs. Thrale got into a convent of English nuns; and I talked with her through the grate, and I am very kindly used by the English Benedictine friars. But upon the whole I cannot make much acquaintance here; and though the churches, palaces, and some private houses are very magnificent, there is no very great pleasure after having seen many, in seeing more; at least the pleasure, whatever it be, must some time have an end, and we are beginning to think when we shall come home. Mr. Thrale calculates that, as we left Streatham on the fifteenth of September, we shall see it again about the fifteenth of November.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Written from a tour in France with the Thrales, Johnson&rsquo;s</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;only visit to the Continent. &mdash; ED.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;** Miss Thrale.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I think I had not been on this side of the sea five days before I found a sensible improvement in my health. I ran a race in the rain this day, and beat Baretti. Baretti is a fine fellow, and speaks French, I think, quite as well as English.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Make my compliments to Mrs. Williams; and give my love to Francis; and tell my friends that I am not lost. I am, dear Sir, your affectionate humble, &amp;c.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">It is to be regretted that he did not write an account of his travels in France; for as he is reported to have once said, that &lsquo;he could write the Life of a Broomstick,&rsquo; so, notwithstanding so many former travellers have exhausted almost every subject for remark in that great kingdom, his very accurate observation, and peculiar vigour of thought and illustration, would have produced a valuable work.</p>
<p class="p24">When I met him in London the following year, the account which he gave me of his French tour, was, &lsquo;Sir, I have seen all the visibilities of Paris, and around it; but to have formed an acquaintance with the people there, would have required more time than I could stay. I was just beginning to creep into acquaintance by means of Colonel Drumgold, a very high man, Sir, head of L&rsquo;Ecole Militaire, a most complete character, for he had first been a professor of rhetorick, and then became a soldier. And, Sir, I was very kindly treated by the English Benedictines, and have a cell appropriated to me in their convent.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He observed, &lsquo;The great in France live very magnificently, but the rest very miserably. There is no happy middle state as in England. The shops of Paris are mean; the meat in the markets is such as would be sent to a gaol in England: and Mr. Thrale justly observed, that the cookery of the French was forced upon them by necessity; for they could not eat their meat, unless they added some taste to it. The French are an indelicate people; they will spit upon any place. At Madame &mdash;&mdash; &mdash; &lsquo;s, a literary lady of rank, the footman took the sugar in his fingers, and threw it into my coffee. I was going to put it aside; but hearing it was made on purpose for me, I e&rsquo;en tasted Tom&rsquo;s fingers. The same lady would needs make tea a l&rsquo;Angloise. The spout of the tea-pot did not pour freely; she had the footman blow into it. France is worse than Scotland in every thing but climate. Nature has done more for the French; but they have done less for themselves than the Scotch have done.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">It happened that Foote was at Paris at the same time with Dr. Johnson, and his description of my friend while there, was abundantly ludicrous. He told me, that the French were quite astonished at his figure and manner, and at his dress, which he obstinately continued exactly as in London; &mdash; his brown clothes, black stockings, and plain shirt. He mentioned, that an Irish gentleman said to Johnson, &lsquo;Sir, you have not seen the best French players.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Players, Sir! I look on them as no better than creatures set upon tables and joint-stools to make faces and produce laughter, like dancing dogs.&rsquo;&mdash; &lsquo;But, Sir, you will allow that some players are better than others?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Yes, Sir, as some dogs dance better than others.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">While Johnson was in France, he was generally very resolute in speaking Latin. It was a maxim with him that a man should not let himself down, by speaking a language which he speaks imperfectly. Indeed, we must have often observed how inferiour, how much like a child a man appears, who speaks a broken tongue. When Sir Joshua Reynolds, at one of the dinners of the Royal Academy, presented him to a Frenchman of great distinction, he would not deign to speak French, but talked Latin, though his Excellency did not understand it, owing, perhaps, to Johnson&rsquo;s English pronunciation: yet upon another occasion he was observed to speak French to a Frenchman of high rank, who spoke English; and being asked the reason, with some expression of surprise, &mdash; he answered, &lsquo;because I think my French is as good as his English.&rsquo; Though Johnson understood French perfectly, he could not speak it readily, as I have observed at his first interview with General Pauli, in 1769; yet he wrote it, I imagine, pretty well.</p>
<p class="p24">Here let me not forget a curious anecdote, as related to me by Mr. Beauclerk, which I shall endeavour to exhibit as well as I can in that gentleman&rsquo;s lively manner; and in justice to him it is proper to add, that Dr. Johnson told me I might rely both on the correctness of his memory, and the fidelity of his narrative. &lsquo;When Madame de Boufflers was first in England, (said Beauclerk,) she was desirous to see Johnson. I accordingly went with her to his chambers in the Temple, where she was entertained with his conversation for some time. When our visit was over, she and I left him, and were got into Inner Temple-lane, when all at once I heard a noise like thunder. This was occasioned by Johnson, who it seems, upon a little recollection, had taken it into his head that he ought to have done the honours of his literary residence to a foreign lady of quality, and eager to shew himself a man of gallantry, was hurrying down the stair-case in violent agitation. He overtook us before we reached the Temple-gate, and brushing in between me and Madame de Boufflers, seized her hand, and conducted her to her coach. His dress was a rusty brown morning suit, a pair of old shoes by way of slippers, a little shrivelled wig sticking on the top of his head, and the sleeves of his shirt and the knees of his breeches hanging loose. A considerable crowd of people gathered round, and were not a little struck by this singular appearance.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He spoke Latin with wonderful fluency and elegance. When Pere Boscovich was in England, Johnson dined in company with him at Sir Joshua Reynolds&rsquo;s, and at Dr. Douglas&rsquo;s, now Bishop of Salisbury. Upon both occasions that celebrated foreigner expressed his astonishment at Johnson&rsquo;s Latin conversation. When at Paris, Johnson thus characterised Voltaire to Freron the Journalist: &lsquo;Vir est acerrimi ingenii et paucarum literarum.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">In the course of this year Dr. Burney informs me that &lsquo;he very frequently met Dr. Johnson at Mr. Thrale&rsquo;s, at Streatham, where they had many long conversations, often sitting up as long as the fire and candles lasted, and much longer than the patience of the servants subsisted.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">A few of Johnson&rsquo;s sayings, which that gentleman recollects, shall here be inserted.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I never take a nap after dinner but when I have had a bad night, and then the nap takes me.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The writer of an epitaph should not be considered as saying nothing but what is strictly true. Allowance must be made for some degree of exaggerated praise. In lapidary inscriptions a man is not upon oath.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;There is now less flogging in our great schools than formerly, but then less is learned there; so that what the boys get at one end they lose at the other.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;More is learned in publick than in private schools, from emulation; there is the collision of mind with mind, or the radiation of many minds pointing to one centre. Though few boys make their own exercises, yet if a good exercise is given up, out of a great number of boys, it is made by somebody.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I hate by-roads in education. Education is as well known, and has long been as well known, as ever it can be. Endeavouring to make children prematurely wise is useless labour. Suppose they have more knowledge at five or six years old than other children, what use can be made of it? It will be lost before it is wanted, and the waste of so much time and labour of the teacher can never be repaid. Too much is expected from precocity, and too little performed. Miss &mdash;&mdash; was an instance of early cultivation, but in what did it terminate? In marrying a little Presbyterian parson, who keeps an infant boarding-school, so that all her employment now is,</p>
<p class="p24">&ldquo;To suckle fools, and chronicle small-beer.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">She tells the children, &ldquo;This is a cat, and that is a dog, with four legs and a tail; see there! you are much better than a cat or a dog, for you can speak.&rdquo; If I had bestowed such an education on a daughter, and had discovered that she thought of marrying such a fellow, I would have sent her to the Congress.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;After having talked slightingly of musick, he was observed to listen very attentively while Miss Thrale played on the harpsichord, and with eagerness he called to her, &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you dash away like Burney?&rdquo; Dr. Burney upon this said to him, &ldquo;I believe, Sir, we shall make a musician of you at last.&rdquo; Johnson with candid complacency replied, &ldquo;Sir, I shall be glad to have a new sense given to me.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;He had come down one morning to the breakfast-room, and been a considerable time by himself before any body appeared. When, on a subsequent day, he was twitted by Mrs. Thrale for being very late, which he generally was, he defended himself by alluding to the extraordinary morning, when he had been too early. &ldquo;Madame, I do not like to come down to VACUITY.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Dr. Burney having remarked that Mr. Garrick was beginning to look old, he said, &ldquo;Why, Sir, you are not to wonder at that; no man&rsquo;s face has had more wear and tear.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">1776: AETAT. 67.] &mdash; Having arrived in London late on Friday, the 15th of March, I hastened next morning to wait on Dr. Johnson, at his house; but found he was removed from Johnson&rsquo;s-court, No. 7, to Bolt-court, No. 8, still keeping to his favourite Fleet-street. My reflection at the time upon this change as marked in my Journal, is as follows: &lsquo;I felt a foolish regret that he had left a court which bore his name;* but it was not foolish to be affected with some tenderness of regard for a place in which I had seen him a great deal, from whence I had often issued a better and a happier man than when I went in, and which had often appeared to my imagination while I trod its pavements, in the solemn darkness of the night, to be sacred to wisdom and piety.&rsquo; Being informed that he was at Mr. Thrale&rsquo;s, in the Borough, I hastened thither, and found Mrs. Thrale and him at breakfast. I was kindly welcomed. In a moment he was in a full glow of conversation, and I felt myself elevated as if brought into another state of being. Mrs. Thrale and I looked to each other while he talked, and our looks expressed our congenial admiration and affection for him. I shall ever recollect this scene with great pleasure, I exclaimed to her, &lsquo;I am now, intellectually, Hermippus redivivus, I am quite restored by him, by transfusion of mind.&rsquo; &lsquo;There are many (she replied) who admire and respect Mr. Johnson; but you and I LOVE him.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* He said, when in Scotland, that he was Johnson of that</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ilk. &mdash; BOSWELL.</p>
<p class="p24">He seemed very happy in the near prospect of going to Italy with Mr. and Mrs. Thrale. &lsquo;But, (said he,) before leaving England I am to take a jaunt to Oxford, Birmingham, my native city Lichfield, and my old friend, Dr. Taylor&rsquo;s, at Ashbourn, in Derbyshire. I shall go in a few days, and you, Boswell, shall go with me.&rsquo; I was ready to accompany him; being willing even to leave London to have the pleasure of his conversation.</p>
<p class="p24">We got into a boat to cross over to Black-friars; and as we moved along the Thames, I talked to him of a little volume, which, altogether unknown to him, was advertised to be published in a few days, under the title of Johnsoniana, or Bon-Mots of Dr. Johnson. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, it is a mighty impudent thing.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Pray, Sir, could you have no redress if you were to prosecute a publisher for bringing out, under your name, what you never said, and ascribing to you dull stupid nonsense, or making you swear profanely, as many ignorant relaters of your bon-mots do?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;No, Sir; there will always be some truth mixed with the falsehood, and how can it be ascertained how much is true and how much is false? Besides, Sir, what damages would a jury give me for having been represented as swearing?&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;I think, Sir, you should at least disavow such a publication, because the world and posterity might with much plausible foundation say, &ldquo;Here is a volume which was publickly advertised and came out in Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s own time, and, by his silence, was admitted by him to be genuine.&rdquo;&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;I shall give myself no trouble about the matter.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He was, perhaps, above suffering from such spurious publications; but I could not help thinking, that many men would be much injured in their reputation, by having absurd and vicious sayings imputed to them; and that redress ought in such cases to be given.</p>
<p class="p24">He said, &lsquo;The value of every story depends on its being true. A story is a picture either of an individual or of human nature in general: if it be false, it is a picture of nothing. For instance: suppose a man should tell that Johnson, before setting out for Italy, as he had to cross the Alps, sat down to make himself wings. This many people would believe; but it would be a picture of nothing. ******* (naming a worthy friend of ours,) used to think a story, a story, till I shewed him that truth was essential to it.&rsquo; I observed, that Foote entertained us with stories which were not true; but that, indeed, it was properly not as narratives that Foote&rsquo;s stories pleased us, but as collections of ludicrous images. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Foote is quite impartial, for he tells lies of every body.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">The importance of strict and scrupulous veracity cannot be too often inculcated. Johnson was known to be so rigidly attentive to it, that even in his common conversation the slightest circumstance was mentioned with exact precision. The knowledge of his having such a principle and habit made his friends have a perfect reliance on the truth of every thing that he told, however it might have been doubted if told by many others. As an instance of this, I may mention an odd incident which he related as having happened to him one night in Fleet-street. &lsquo;A gentlewoman (said he) begged I would give her my arm to assist her in crossing the street, which I accordingly did; upon which she offered me a shilling, supposing me to be the watchman. I perceived that she was somewhat in liquor.&rsquo; This, if told by most people, would have been thought an invention; when told by Johnson, it was believed by his friends as much as if they had seen what passed.</p>
<p class="p24">We landed at the Temple-stairs, where we parted.</p>
<p class="p24">I found him in the evening in Mrs. Williams&rsquo;s room. Finding him still persevering in his abstinence from wine, I ventured to speak to him of it &mdash; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, I have no objection to a man&rsquo;s drinking wine, if he can do it in moderation. I found myself apt to go to excess in it, and therefore, after having been for some time without it, on account of illness, I thought it better not to return to it. Every man is to judge for himself, according to the effects which he experiences. One of the fathers tells us, he found fasting made him so peevish that he did not practise it.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Though he often enlarged upon the evil of intoxication, he was by no means harsh and unforgiving to those who indulged in occasional excess in wine. One of his friends, I well remember, came to sup at a tavern with him and some other gentlemen, and too plainly discovered that he had drunk too much at dinner. When one who loved mischief, thinking to produce a severe censure, asked Johnson, a few days afterwards, &lsquo;Well, Sir, what did your friend say to you, as an apology for being in such a situation?&rsquo; Johnson answered, &lsquo;Sir, he said all that a man SHOULD say: he said he was sorry for it.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I again visited him on Monday. He took occasion to enlarge, as he often did, upon the wretchedness of a sea-life. &lsquo;A ship is worse than a gaol. There is, in a gaol, better air, better company, better conveniency of every kind; and a ship has the additional disadvantage of being in danger. When men come to like a sea-life, they are not fit to live on land.&rsquo;&mdash; &lsquo;Then (said I) it would be cruel in a father to breed his son to the sea.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;It would be cruel in a father who thinks as I do. Men go to sea, before they know the unhappiness of that way of life; and when they have come to know it, they cannot escape from it, because it is then too late to choose another profession; as indeed is generally the case with men, when they have once engaged in any particular way of life.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Tuesday, March 19, which was fixed for our proposed jaunt, we met in the morning at the Somerset coffee-house in the Strand, where we were taken up by the Oxford coach. He was accompanied by Mr. Gwyn, the architect; and a gentleman of Merton College, whom we did not know, had the fourth seat. We soon got into conversation; for it was very remarkable of Johnson, that the presence of a stranger had no restraint upon his talk. I observed that Garrick, who was about to quit the stage, would soon have an easier life. JOHNSON. &lsquo;I doubt that, Sir.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Why, Sir, he will be Atlas with the burthen off his back.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;But I know not, Sir, if he will be so steady without his load. However, he should never play any more, but be entirely the gentleman, and not partly the player: he should no longer subject himself to be hissed by a mob, or to be insolently treated by performers, whom he used to rule with a high hand, and who would gladly retaliate.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;I think he should play once a year for the benefit of decayed actors, as it has been said he means to do.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Alas, Sir! he will soon be a decayed actor himself.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson expressed his disapprobation of ornamental architecture, such as magnificent columns supporting a portico, or expensive pilasters supporting merely their own capitals, &lsquo;because it consumes labour disproportionate to its utility.&rsquo; For the same reason he satyrised statuary. &lsquo;Painting (said he) consumes labour not disproportionate to its effect; but a fellow will hack half a year at a block of marble to make something in stone that hardly resembles a man. The value of statuary is owing to its difficulty. You would not value the finest head cut upon a carrot.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Gwyn was a fine lively rattling fellow. Dr. Johnson kept him in subjection, but with a kindly authority. The spirit of the artist, however, rose against what he thought a Gothick attack, and he made a brisk defence. &lsquo;What, Sir, will you allow no value to beauty in architecture or in statuary? Why should we allow it then in writing? Why do you take the trouble to give us so many fine allusions, and bright images, and elegant phrases? You might convey all your instruction without these ornaments.&rsquo; Johnson smiled with complacency; but said, &lsquo;Why, Sir, all these ornaments are useful, because they obtain an easier reception for truth; but a building is not at all more convenient for being decorated with superfluous carved work.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Gwyn at last was lucky enough to make one reply to Dr. Johnson, which he allowed to be excellent. Johnson censured him for taking down a church which might have stood many years, and building a new one at a different place, for no other reason but that there might be a direct road to a new bridge; and his expression was, &lsquo;You are taking a church out of the way, that the people may go in a straight line to the bridge.&rsquo;&mdash; &lsquo;No, Sir, (said Gwyn,) I am putting the church IN the way, that the people may not GO OUT OF THE WAY.&rsquo; JOHNSON. (with a hearty loud laugh of approbation,) &lsquo;Speak no more. Rest your colloquial fame upon this.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Upon our arrival at Oxford, Dr. Johnson and I went directly to University College, but were disappointed on finding that one of the fellows, his friend Mr. Scott, who accompanied him from Newcastle to Edinburgh, was gone to the country. We put up at the Angel inn, and passed the evening by ourselves in easy and familiar conversation. Talking of constitutional melancholy, he observed, &lsquo;A man so afflicted, Sir, must divert distressing thoughts, and not combat with them.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;May not he think them down, Sir?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;No, Sir. To attempt to THINK THEM DOWN is madness. He should have a lamp constantly burning in his bed-chamber during the night, and if wakefully disturbed, take a book, and read, and compose himself to rest. To have the management of the mind is a great art, and it may be attained in a considerable degree by experience and habitual exercise.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Should not he provide amusements for himself? Would it not, for instance, be right for him to take a course of chymistry?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Let him take a course of chymistry, or a course of rope-dancing, or a course of any thing to which he is inclined at the time. Let him contrive to have as many retreats for his mind as he can, as many things to which it can fly from itself. Burton&rsquo;s Anatomy of Melancholy is a valuable work. It is, perhaps, overloaded with quotation. But there is great spirit and great power in what Burton says, when he writes from his own mind.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Next morning we visited Dr. Wetherell, Master of University College, with whom Dr. Johnson conferred on the most advantageous mode of disposing of the books printed at the Clarendon press. I often had occasion to remark, Johnson loved business, loved to have his wisdom actually operate on real life.</p>
<p class="p24">We then went to Pembroke College, and waited on his old friend Dr. Adams, the master of it, whom I found to be a most polite, pleasing, communicative man. Before his advancement to the headship of his college, I had intended to go and visit him at Shrewsbury, where he was rector of St. Chad&rsquo;s, in order to get from him what particulars he could recollect of Johnson&rsquo;s academical life. He now obligingly gave me part of that authentick information, which, with what I afterwards owed to his kindness, will be found incorporated in its proper place in this work.</p>
<p class="p24">Dr. Adams told us, that in some of the Colleges at Oxford, the fellows had excluded the students from social intercourse with them in the common room. JOHNSON. &lsquo;They are in the right, Sir: there can be no real conversation, no fair exertion of mind amongst them, if the young men are by; for a man who has a character does not choose to stake it in their presence.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;But, Sir, may there not be very good conversation without a contest for superiority?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;No animated conversation, Sir, for it cannot be but one or other will come off superiour. I do not mean that the victor must have the better of the argument, for he may take the weak side; but his superiority of parts and knowledge will necessarily appear: and he to whom he thus shews himself superiour is lessened in the eyes of the young men.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">We walked with Dr. Adams into the master&rsquo;s garden, and into the common room. JOHNSON. (after a reverie of meditation,) &lsquo;Ay! Here I used to play at draughts with Phil. Jones and Fludyer. Jones loved beer, and did not get very forward in the church. Fludyer turned out a scoundrel, a Whig, and said he was ashamed of having been bred at Oxford. He had a living at Putney, and got under the eye of some retainers to the court at that time, and so became a violent Whig: but he had been a scoundrel all along to be sure.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Was he a scoundrel, Sir, in any other way than that of being a political scoundrel? Did he cheat at draughts?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, we never played for MONEY.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He then carried me to visit Dr. Bentham, Canon of Christ-Church, and Divinity Professor, with whose learned and lively conversation we were much pleased. He gave us an invitation to dinner, which Dr. Johnson told me was a high honour. &lsquo;Sir, it is a great thing to dine with the Canons of Christ-Church.&rsquo; We could not accept his invitation, as we were engaged to dine at University College. We had an excellent dinner there, with the Master and Fellows, it being St. Cuthbert&rsquo;s day, which is kept by them as a festival, as he was a saint of Durham, with which this college is much connected.</p>
<p class="p24">We drank tea with Dr. Horne, late President of Magdalen College, and Bishop of Norwich, of whose abilities, in different respects, the publick has had eminent proofs, and the esteem annexed to whose character was increased by knowing him personally.</p>
<p class="p24">We then went to Trinity College, where he introduced me to Mr. Thomas Warton, with whom we passed a part of the evening. We talked of biography &mdash; JOHNSON. &lsquo;It is rarely well executed. They only who live with a man can write his life with any genuine exactness and discrimination; and few people who have lived with a man know what to remark about him. The chaplain of a late Bishop, whom I was to assist in writing some memoirs of his Lordship, could tell me scarcely any thing.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I said, Mr. Robert Dodsley&rsquo;s life should be written, as he had been so much connected with the wits of his time, and by his literary merit had raised himself from the station of a footman. Mr. Warton said, he had published a little volume under the title of The Muse in Livery. JOHNSON. &lsquo;I doubt whether Dodsley&rsquo;s brother would thank a man who should write his life: yet Dodsley himself was not unwilling that his original low condition should be recollected. When Lord Lyttelton&rsquo;s Dialogues of the Dead came out, one of which is between Apicius, an ancient epicure, and Dartineuf, a modern epicure, Dodsley said to me, &ldquo;I knew Dartineuf well, for I was once his footman.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I mentioned Sir Richard Steele having published his Christian Hero, with the avowed purpose of obliging himself to lead a religious life; yet, that his conduct was by no means strictly suitable. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Steele, I believe, practised the lighter vices.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Mr. Warton, being engaged, could not sup with us at our inn; we had therefore another evening by ourselves. I asked Johnson, whether a man&rsquo;s being forward to make himself known to eminent people, and seeing as much of life, and getting as much information as he could in every way, was not yet lessening himself by his forwardness. JOHNSON. &lsquo;No, Sir, a man always makes himself greater as he increases his knowledge.</p>
<p class="p24">I censured some ludicrous fantastick dialogues between two coach-horses and other such stuff, which Baretti had lately published. He joined with me, and said, &lsquo;Nothing odd will do long. Tristram Shandy did not last.&rsquo; I expressed a desire to be acquainted with a lady who had been much talked of, and universally celebrated for extraordinary address and insinuation. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Never believe extraordinary characters which you hear of people. Depend upon it, Sir, they are exaggerated. You do not see one man shoot a great deal higher than another.&rsquo; I mentioned Mr. Burke. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Yes; Burke is an extraordinary man. His stream of mind is perpetual.&rsquo; It is very pleasing to me to record, that Johnson&rsquo;s high estimation of the talents of this gentleman was uniform from their early acquaintance. Sir Joshua Reynolds informs me, that when Mr. Burke was first elected a member of Parliament, and Sir John Hawkins expressed a wonder at his attaining a seat, Johnson said, &lsquo;Now we who know Mr. Burke, know, that he will be one of the first men in this country.&rsquo; And once, when Johnson was ill, and unable to exert himself as much as usual without fatigue, Mr. Burke having been mentioned, he said, &lsquo;That fellow calls forth all my powers. Were I to see Burke now it would kill me.&rsquo; So much was he accustomed to consider conversation as a contest, and such was his notion of Burke as an opponent.</p>
<p class="p24">Next morning, Thursday, March 21, we set out in a post-chaise to pursue our ramble. It was a delightful day, and we rode through Blenheim park. When I looked at the magnificent bridge built by John Duke of Marlborough, over a small rivulet, and recollected the Epigram made upon it &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;The lofty arch his high ambition shows,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stream, an emblem of his bounty flows:&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">and saw that now, by the genius of Brown, a magnificent body of water was collected, I said, &lsquo;They have DROWNED the Epigram.&rsquo; I observed to him, while in the midst of the noble scene around us, &lsquo;You and I, Sir, have, I think, seen together the extremes of what can be seen in Britain: &mdash; the wild rough island of Mull, and Blenheim park.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">We dined at an excellent inn at Chapel-house, where he expatiated on the felicity of England in its taverns and inns, and triumphed over the French for not having, in any perfection, the tavern life. &lsquo;There is no private house, (said he,) in which people can enjoy themselves so well, as at a capital tavern. Let there be ever so great plenty of good things, ever so much grandeur, ever so much elegance, ever so much desire that every body should be easy; in the nature of things it cannot be: there must always be some degree of care and anxiety. The master of the house is anxious to entertain his guests; the guests are anxious to be agreeable to him: and no man, but a very impudent dog indeed, can as freely command what is in another man&rsquo;s house, as if it were his own. Whereas, at a tavern, there is a general freedom from anxiety. You are sure you are welcome: and the more noise you make, the more trouble you give, the more good things you call for, the welcomer you are. No servants will attend you with the alacrity which waiters do, who are incited by the prospect of an immediate reward, in proportion as they please. No, Sir; there is nothing which has yet been contrived by man, by which so much happiness is produced as by a good tavern or inn.&rsquo;* He then repeated, with great emotion, Shenstone&rsquo;s lines: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Whoe&rsquo;er has travell&rsquo;d life&rsquo;s dull round,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where&rsquo;er his stages may have been,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May sigh to think he still has found</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warmest welcome at an inn.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Sir John Hawkins has preserved very few Memorabilia of</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Johnson. There is, however, to be found, in his bulky tome</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[p. 87], a very excellent one upon this subject:&mdash; &lsquo;In</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;contradiction to those, who, having a wife and children,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;prefer domestick enjoyments to those which a tavern affords,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have heard him assert, that a tavern chair was the throne</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of human felicity.&mdash; &ldquo;As soon,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;as I enter the door</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of a tavern, I experience an oblivion of care, and a freedom</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from solicitude: when I am seated, I find the master</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;courteous, and the servants obsequious to my call; anxious</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to know and ready to supply my wants: wine there exhilarates</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my spirits, and prompts me to free conversation and an</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;interchange of discourse with those whom I most love: I</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dogmatise and am contradicted, and in this conflict of</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;opinions and sentiments I find delight.&rdquo;&rsquo; &mdash; BOSWELL.</p>
<p class="p24">In the afternoon, as we were driven rapidly along in the post-chaise, he said to me &lsquo;Life has not many things better than this.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">We stopped at Stratford-upon-Avon, and drank tea and coffee; and it pleased me to be with him upon the classick ground of Shakspeare&rsquo;s native place.</p>
<p class="p24">He spoke slightingly of Dyer&rsquo;s Fleece.&mdash; &lsquo;The subject, Sir, cannot be made poetical. How can a man write poetically of serges and druggets? Yet you will hear many people talk to you gravely of that excellent poem, The Fleece.&rsquo; Having talked of Grainger&rsquo;s Sugar-Cane, I mentioned to him Mr. Langton&rsquo;s having told me, that this poem, when read in manuscript at Sir Joshua Reynolds&rsquo;s, had made all the assembled wits burst into a laugh, when, after much blank-verse pomp, the poet began a new paragraph thus: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Now, Muse, let&rsquo;s sing of rats.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">And what increased the ridicule was, that one of the company, who slily overlooked the reader, perceived that the word had been originally MICE, and had been altered to RATS, as more dignified.</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson said, that Dr. Grainger was an agreeable man; a man who would do any good that was in his power. His translation of Tibullus, he thought, was very well done; but The Sugar-Cane, a poem, did not please him; for, he exclaimed, &lsquo;What could he make of a sugar-cane? One might as well write the &ldquo;Parsley-bed, a Poem;&rdquo; or &ldquo;The Cabbage-garden, a Poem.&rdquo;&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;You must then pickle your cabbage with the sal atticum.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;You know there is already The Hop-Garden, a Poem: and, I think, one could say a great deal about cabbage. The poem might begin with the advantages of civilized society over a rude state, exemplified by the Scotch, who had no cabbages till Oliver Cromwell&rsquo;s soldiers introduced them; and one might thus shew how arts are propagated by conquest, as they were by the Roman arms.&rsquo; He seemed to be much diverted with the fertility of his own fancy.</p>
<p class="p24">I told him, that I heard Dr. Percy was writing the history of the wolf in Great-Britain. JOHNSON. &lsquo;The wolf, Sir! why the wolf? why does he not write of the bear, which we had formerly? Nay, it is said we had the beaver. Or why does he not write of the grey rat, the Hanover rat, as it is called, because it is said to have come into this country about the time that the family of Hanover came? I should like to see The History of the Grey Rat, by Thomas Percy, D. D., Chaplain in Ordinary to his Majesty,&rsquo; (laughing immoderately). BOSWELL. &lsquo;I am afraid a court chaplain could not decently write of the grey rat.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, he need not give it the name of the Hanover rat.&rsquo; Thus could he indulge a luxuriant sportive imagination, when talking of a friend whom he loved and esteemed.</p>
<p class="p24">On Friday, March 22, having set out early from Henley, where we had lain the preceding night, we arrived at Birmingham about nine o&rsquo;clock, and, after breakfast, went to call on his old schoolfellow Mr. Hector. A very stupid maid, who opened the door, told us, that &lsquo;her master was gone out; he was gone to the country; she could not tell when he would return.&rsquo; In short, she gave us a miserable reception; and Johnson observed, &lsquo;She would have behaved no better to people who wanted him in the way of his profession.&rsquo; He said to her, &lsquo;My name is Johnson; tell him I called. Will you remember the name?&rsquo; She answered with rustick simplicity, in the Warwickshire pronunciation, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t understand you, Sir.&rsquo;&mdash; &lsquo;Blockhead, (said he,) I&rsquo;ll write.&rsquo; I never heard the word blockhead applied to a woman before, though I do not see why it should not, when there is evident occasion for it. He, however, made another attempt to make her understand him, and roared loud in her ear, &lsquo;Johnson,&rsquo; and then she catched the sound.</p>
<p class="p24">We next called on Mr. Lloyd, one of the people called Quakers. He too was not at home; but Mrs. Lloyd was, and received us courteously, and asked us to dinner. Johnson said to me, &lsquo;After the uncertainty of all human things at Hector&rsquo;s, this invitation came very well.&rsquo; We walked about the town, and he was pleased to see it increasing.</p>
<p class="p24">Mr. Lloyd joined us in the street; and in a little while we met Friend Hector, as Mr. Lloyd called him. It gave me pleasure to observe the joy which Johnson and he expressed on seeing each other again. Mr. Lloyd and I left them together, while he obligingly shewed me some of the manufactures of this very curious assemblage of artificers. We all met at dinner at Mr. Lloyd&rsquo;s, where we were entertained with great hospitality. Mr. and Mrs. Lloyd had been married the same year with their Majesties, and like them, had been blessed with a numerous family of fine children, their numbers being exactly the same. Johnson said, &lsquo;Marriage is the best state for a man in general; and every man is a worse man, in proportion as he is unfit for the married state.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Dr. Johnson said to me in the morning, &lsquo;You will see, Sir, at Mr. Hector&rsquo;s, his sister, Mrs. Careless, a clergyman&rsquo;s widow. She was the first woman with whom I was in love. It dropt out of my head imperceptibly; but she and I shall always have a kindness for each other.&rsquo; He laughed at the notion that a man never can be really in love but once, and considered it as a mere romantick fancy.</p>
<p class="p24">On our return from Mr. Bolton&rsquo;s, Mr. Hector took me to his house, where we found Johnson sitting placidly at tea, with his first love; who, though now advanced in years, was a genteel woman, very agreeable, and well-bred.</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson lamented to Mr. Hector the state of one of their school-fellows, Mr. Charles Congreve, a clergyman, which he thus described: &lsquo;He obtained, I believe, considerable preferment in Ireland, but now lives in London, quite as a valetudinarian, afraid to go into any house but his own. He takes a short airing in his post-chaise every day. He has an elderly woman, whom he calls cousin, who lives with him, and jogs his elbow when his glass has stood too long empty, and encourages him in drinking, in which he is very willing to be encouraged; not that he gets drunk, for he is a very pious man, but he is always muddy. He confesses to one bottle of port every day, and he probably drinks more. He is quite unsocial; his conversation is quite monosyllabical: and when, at my last visit, I asked him what a clock it was? that signal of my departure had so pleasing an effect on him, that he sprung up to look at his watch, like a greyhound bounding at a hare.&rsquo; When Johnson took leave of Mr. Hector, he said, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t grow like Congreve; nor let me grow like him, when you are near me.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">When he again talked of Mrs. Careless to-night, he seemed to have had his affection revived; for he said, &lsquo;If I had married her, it might have been as happy for me.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Pray, Sir, do you not suppose that there are fifty women in the world, with any one of whom a man may be as happy, as with any one woman in particular?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Ay, Sir, fifty thousand.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Then, Sir, you are not of opinion with some who imagine that certain men and certain women are made for each other; and that they cannot be happy if they miss their counterparts?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;To be sure not, Sir. I believe marriages would in general be as happy, and often more so, if they were all made by the Lord Chancellor, upon a due consideration of characters and circumstances, without the parties having any choice in the matter.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I wished to have staid at Birmingham to-night, to have talked more with Mr. Hector; but my friend was impatient to reach his native city; so we drove on that stage in the dark, and were long pensive and silent. When we came within the focus of the Lichfield lamps, &lsquo;Now (said he,) we are getting out of a state of death.&rsquo; We put up at the Three Crowns, not one of the great inns, but a good old fashioned one, which was kept by Mr. Wilkins, and was the very next house to that in which Johnson was born and brought up, and which was still his own property. We had a comfortable supper, and got into high spirits. I felt all my Toryism glow in this old capital of Staffordshire. I could have offered incense genio loci; and I indulged in libations of that ale, which Boniface, in The Beaux Stratagem, recommends with such an eloquent jollity.</p>
<p class="p24">Next morning he introduced me to Mrs. Lucy Porter, his step-daughter. She was now an old maid, with much simplicity of manner. She had never been in London. Her brother, a Captain in the navy, had left her a fortune of ten thousand pounds; about a third of which she had laid out in building a stately house, and making a handsome garden, in an elevated situation in Lichfield. Johnson, when here by himself, used to live at her house. She reverenced him, and he had a parental tenderness for her.</p>
<p class="p24">We then visited Mr. Peter Garrick, who had that morning received a letter from his brother David, announcing our coming to Lichfield. He was engaged to dinner, but asked us to tea, and to sleep at his house. Johnson, however, would not quit his old acquaintance Wilkins, of the Three Crowns. The family likeness of the Garricks was very striking; and Johnson thought that David&rsquo;s vivacity was not so peculiar to himself as was supposed. &lsquo;Sir, (said he,) I don&rsquo;t know but if Peter had cultivated all the arts of gaiety as much as David has done, he might have been as brisk and lively. Depend upon it, Sir, vivacity is much an art, and depends greatly on habit.&rsquo; I believe there is a good deal of truth in this, notwithstanding a ludicrous story told me by a lady abroad, of a heavy German baron, who had lived much with the young English at Geneva, and was ambitious to be as lively as they; with which view, he, with assiduous exertion, was jumping over the tables and chairs in his lodgings; and when the people of the house ran in and asked, with surprize, what was the matter, he answered, &lsquo;Sh&rsquo; apprens t&rsquo;etre fif.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">We dined at our inn, and had with us a Mr. Jackson, one of Johnson&rsquo;s schoolfellows, whom he treated with much kindness, though he seemed to be a low man, dull and untaught. He had a coarse grey coat, black waistcoat, greasy leather breeches, and a yellow uncurled wig; and his countenance had the ruddiness which betokens one who is in no haste to &lsquo;leave his can.&rsquo; He drank only ale. He had tried to be a cutler at Birmingham, but had not succeeded; and now he lived poorly at home, and had some scheme of dressing leather in a better manner than common; to his indistinct account of which, Dr. Johnson listened with patient attention, that he might assist him with his advice. Here was an instance of genuine humanity and real kindness in this great man, who has been most unjustly represented as altogether harsh and destitute of tenderness. A thousand such instances might have been recorded in the course of his long life; though that his temper was warm and hasty, and his manner often rough, cannot be denied.</p>
<p class="p24">I saw here, for the first time, oat ale; and oat cakes not hard as in Scotland, but soft like a Yorkshire cake, were served at breakfast. It was pleasant to me to find, that Oats, the food of horses, were so much used as the food of the people in Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s own town. He expatiated in praise of Lichfield and its inhabitants, who, he said, were &lsquo;the most sober, decent people in England, the genteelest in proportion to their wealth, and spoke the purest English.&rsquo; I doubted as to the last article of this eulogy: for they had several provincial sounds; as THERE, pronounced like FEAR, instead of like FAIR; ONCE pronounced WOONSE, instead of WUNSE, or WONSE. Johnson himself never got entirely free of those provincial accents. Garrick sometimes used to take him off, squeezing a lemon into a punch-bowl, with uncouth gesticulations, looking round the company, and calling out, &lsquo;Who&rsquo;s for POONSH?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Very little business appeared to be going forward in Lichfield. I found however two strange manufactures for so inland a place, sail-cloth and streamers for ships; and I observed them making some saddle-cloths, and dressing sheepskins: but upon the whole, the busy hand of industry seemed to be quite slackened. &lsquo;Surely, Sir, (said I,) you are an idle set of people.&rsquo; &lsquo;Sir, (said Johnson,) we are a city of philosophers, we work with our heads, and make the boobies of Birmingham work for us with their hands.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">There was at this time a company of players performing at Lichfield, The manager, Mr. Stanton, sent his compliments, and begged leave to wait on Dr. Johnson. Johnson received him very courteously, and he drank a glass of wine with us. He was a plain decent well-behaved man, and expressed his gratitude to Dr. Johnson for having once got him permission from Dr. Taylor at Ashbourne to play there upon moderate terms. Garrick&rsquo;s name was soon introduced. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Garrick&rsquo;s conversation is gay and grotesque. It is a dish of all sorts, but all good things. There is no solid meat in it: there is a want of sentiment in it. Not but that he has sentiment sometimes, and sentiment, too, very powerful and very pleasing: but it has not its full proportion in his conversation.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">When we were by ourselves he told me, &lsquo;Forty years ago, Sir, I was in love with an actress here, Mrs. Emmet, who acted Flora, in Hob in the Well.&rsquo; What merit this lady had as an actress, or what was her figure, or her manner, I have not been informed: but, if we may believe Mr. Garrick, his old master&rsquo;s taste in theatrical merit was by no means refined; he was not an elegans formarum spectator. Garrick used to tell, that Johnson said of an actor, who played Sir Harry Wildair at Lichfield, &lsquo;There is a courtly vivacity about the fellow;&rsquo; when in fact, according to Garrick&rsquo;s account, &lsquo;he was the most vulgar ruffian that ever went upon boards.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">We had promised Mr. Stanton to be at his theatre on Monday. Dr. Johnson jocularly proposed me to write a Prologue for the occasion: &lsquo;A Prologue, by James Boswell, Esq. from the Hebrides.&rsquo; I was really inclined to take the hint. Methought, &lsquo;Prologue, spoken before Dr. Samuel Johnson, at Lichfield, 1776;&rsquo; would have sounded as well as, &lsquo;Prologue, spoken before the Duke of York, at Oxford,&rsquo; in Charles the Second&rsquo;s time. Much might have been said of what Lichfield had done for Shakspeare, by producing Johnson and Garrick. But I found he was averse to it.</p>
<p class="p24">We went and viewed the museum of Mr. Richard Green, apothecary here, who told me he was proud of being a relation of Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s. It was, truely, a wonderful collection, both of antiquities and natural curiosities, and ingenious works of art. He had all the articles accurately arranged, with their names upon labels, printed at his own little press; and on the staircase leading to it was a board, with the names of contributors marked in gold letters. A printed catalogue of the collection was to be had at a bookseller&rsquo;s. Johnson expressed his admiration of the activity and diligence and good fortune of Mr. Green, in getting together, in his situation, so great a variety of things; and Mr. Green told me that Johnson once said to him, &lsquo;Sir, I should as soon have thought of building a man of war, as of collecting such a museum.&rsquo; Mr. Green&rsquo;s obliging alacrity in shewing it was very pleasing.</p>
<p class="p24">We drank tea and coffee at Mr. Peter Garrick&rsquo;s, where was Mrs. Aston, one of the maiden sisters of Mrs. Walmsley, wife of Johnson&rsquo;s first friend, and sister also of the lady of whom Johnson used to speak with the warmest admiration, by the name of Molly Aston, who was afterwards married to Captain Brodie of the navy.</p>
<p class="p24">On Sunday, March 24, we breakfasted with Mrs. Cobb, a widow lady, who lived in an agreeable sequestered place close by the town, called the Friary, it having been formerly a religious house. She and her niece, Miss Adey, were great admirers of Dr. Johnson; and he behaved to them with a kindness and easy pleasantry, such as we see between old and intimate acquaintance. He accompanied Mrs. Cobb to St. Mary&rsquo;s church, and I went to the cathedral, where I was very much delighted with the musick, finding it to be peculiarly solemn and accordant with the words of the service.</p>
<p class="p24">We dined at Mr. Peter Garrick&rsquo;s, who was in a very lively humour, and verified Johnson&rsquo;s saying, that if he had cultivated gaiety as much as his brother David, he might have equally excelled in it. He was to-day quite a London narrator, telling us a variety of anecdotes with that earnestness and attempt at mimicry which we usually find in the wits of the metropolis. Dr. Johnson went with me to the cathedral in the afternoon. It was grand and pleasing to contemplate this illustrious writer, now full of fame, worshipping in the &lsquo;solemn temple&rsquo; of his native city.</p>
<p class="p24">I returned to tea and coffee at Mr. Peter Garrick&rsquo;s, and then found Dr. Johnson at the Reverend Mr. Seward&rsquo;s, Canon Residentiary, who inhabited the Bishop&rsquo;s palace, in which Mr. Walmsley lived, and which had been the scene of many happy hours in Johnson&rsquo;s early life.</p>
<p class="p24">On monday, March 25, we breakfasted at Mrs. Lucy Porter&rsquo;s. Johnson had sent an express to Dr. Taylor&rsquo;s, acquainting him of our being at Lichfield, and Taylor had returned an answer that his postchaise should come for us this day. While we sat at breakfast, Dr. Johnson received a letter by the post, which seemed to agitate him very much. When he had read it, he exclaimed, &lsquo;One of the most dreadful things that has happened in my time.&rsquo; The phrase my time, like the word age, is usually understood to refer to an event of a publick or general nature. I imagined something like an assassination of the King &mdash; like a gunpowder plot carried into execution &mdash; or like another fire of London. When asked, &lsquo;What is it, Sir?&rsquo; he answered, &lsquo;Mr. Thrale has lost his only son!&rsquo; This was, no doubt, a very great affliction to Mr. and Mrs. Thrale, which their friends would consider accordingly; but from the manner in which the intelligence of it was communicated by Johnson, it appeared for the moment to be comparatively small. I, however, soon felt a sincere concern, and was curious to observe, how Dr. Johnson would be affected. He said, &lsquo;This is a total extinction to their family, as much as if they were sold into captivity.&rsquo; Upon my mentioning that Mr. Thrale had daughters, who might inherit his wealth;&mdash; &lsquo;Daughters, (said Johnson, warmly,) he&rsquo;ll no more value his daughters than&mdash; &lsquo; I was going to speak.&mdash; &lsquo;Sir, (said he,) don&rsquo;t you know how you yourself think? Sir, he wishes to propagate his name.&rsquo; In short, I saw male succession strong in his mind, even where there was no name, no family of any long standing. I said, it was lucky he was not present when this misfortune happened. JOHNSON. &lsquo;It is lucky for ME. People in distress never think that you feel enough.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;And Sir, they will have the hope of seeing you, which will be a relief in the mean time; and when you get to them, the pain will be so far abated, that they will be capable of being consoled by you, which, in the first violence of it, I believe, would not be the case.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;No, Sir; violent pain of mind, like violent pain of body, MUST be severely felt.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;I own, Sir, I have not so much feeling for the distress of others, as some people have, or pretend to have: but I know this, that I would do all in my power to relieve them.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir it is affectation to pretend to feel the distress of others, as much as they do themselves. It is equally so, as if one should pretend to feel as much pain while a friend&rsquo;s leg is cutting off, as he does. No, Sir; you have expressed the rational and just nature of sympathy. I would have gone to the extremity of the earth to have preserved this boy.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He was soon quite calm. The letter was from Mr. Thrale&rsquo;s clerk, and concluded, &lsquo;I need not say how much they wish to see you in London.&rsquo; He said, &lsquo;We shall hasten back from Taylor&rsquo;s.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Mrs. Lucy Porter and some other ladies of the place talked a great deal of him when he was out of the room, not only with veneration but affection. It pleased me to find that he was so much BELOVED in his native city.</p>
<p class="p24">Mrs. Aston, whom I had seen the preceding night, and her sister, Mrs. Gastrel, a widow lady, had each a house and garden, and pleasure-ground, prettily situated upon Stowhill, a gentle eminence, adjoining to Lichfield. Johnson walked away to dinner there, leaving me by myself without any apology; I wondered at this want of that facility of manners, from which a man has no difficulty in carrying a friend to a house where he is intimate; I felt it very unpleasant to be thus left in solitude in a country town, where I was an entire stranger, and began to think myself unkindly deserted; but I was soon relieved, and convinced that my friend, instead of being deficient in delicacy, had conducted the matter with perfect propriety, for I received the following note in his handwriting: &lsquo;Mrs. Gastrel, at the lower house on Stowhill, desires Mr. Boswell&rsquo;s company to dinner at two.&rsquo; I accepted of the invitation, and had here another proof how amiable his character was in the opinion of those who knew him best. I was not informed, till afterwards, that Mrs. Gastrel&rsquo;s husband was the clergyman who, while he lived at Stratford upon Avon, where he was proprietor of Shakspeare&rsquo;s garden, with Gothick barbarity cut down his mulberry-tree, and, as Dr. Johnson told me, did it to vex his neighbours. His lady, I have reason to believe, on the same authority, participated in the guilt of what the enthusiasts for our immortal bard deem almost a species of sacrilege.</p>
<p class="p24">After dinner Dr. Johnson wrote a letter to Mrs. Thrale on the death of her son. I said it would be very distressing to Thrale, but she would soon forget it, as she had so many things to think of. JOHNSON. &lsquo;No, Sir, Thrale will forget it first. SHE has many things that she MAY think of. HE has many things that he MUST think of.&rsquo; This was a very just remark upon the different effect of those light pursuits which occupy a vacant and easy mind, and those serious engagements which arrest attention, and keep us from brooding over grief.</p>
<p class="p24">In the evening we went to the Town-hall, which was converted into a temporary theatre, and saw Theodosius, with The Stratford Jubilee. I was happy to see Dr. Johnson sitting in a conspicuous part of the pit, and receiving affectionate homage from all his acquaintance. We were quite gay and merry. I afterwards mentioned to him that I condemned myself for being so, when poor Mr. and Mrs. Thrale were in such distress. JOHNSON. &lsquo;You are wrong, Sir; twenty years hence Mr. and Mrs. Thrale will not suffer much pain from the death of their son. Now, Sir, you are to consider, that distance of place, as well as distance of time, operates upon the human feelings. I would not have you be gay in the presence of the distressed, because it would shock them; but you may be gay at a distance. Pain for the loss of a friend, or of a relation whom we love, is occasioned by the want which we feel. In time the vacuity is filled with something else; or sometimes the vacuity closes up of itself.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Mr. Seward and Mr. Pearson, another clergyman here, supt with us at our inn, and after they left us, we sat up late as we used to do in London.</p>
<p class="p24">Here I shall record some fragments of my friend&rsquo;s conversation during this jaunt.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Marriage, Sir, is much more necessary to a man than to a woman; for he is much less able to supply himself with domestick comforts. You will recollect my saying to some ladies the other day, that I had often wondered why young women should marry, as they have so much more freedom, and so much more attention paid to them while unmarried, than when married. I indeed did not mention the STRONG reason for their marrying &mdash; the MECHANICAL reason.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Why, that IS a strong one. But does not imagination make it much more important than it is in reality? Is it not, to a certain degree, a delusion in us as well as in women?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why yes, Sir; but it is a delusion that is always beginning again.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know but there is upon the whole more misery than happiness produced by that passion.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think so, Sir.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Never speak of a man in his own presence. It is always indelicate, and may be offensive.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Questioning is not the mode of conversation among gentlemen. It is assuming a superiority, and it is particularly wrong to question a man concerning himself. There may be parts of his former life which he may not wish to be made known to other persons, or even brought to his own recollection.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;A man should be careful never to tell tales of himself to his own disadvantage. People may be amused and laugh at the time, but they will be remembered, and brought out against him upon some subsequent occasion.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Much may be done if a man puts his whole mind to a particular object. By doing so, Norton has made himself the great lawyer that he is allowed to be.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Tuesday, March 26, there came for us an equipage properly suited to a wealthy well-beneficed clergyman; &mdash; Dr. Taylor&rsquo;s large roomy post-chaise, drawn by four stout plump horses, and driven by two steady jolly postillions, which conveyed us to Ashbourne; where I found my friend&rsquo;s schoolfellow living upon an establishment perfectly corresponding with his substantial creditable equipage: his house, garden, pleasure-grounds, table, in short every thing good, and no scantiness appearing. Every man should form such a plan of living as he can execute completely. Let him not draw an outline wider than he can fill up. I have seen many skeletons of shew and magnificence which excite at once ridicule and pity. Dr. Taylor had a good estate of his own, and good preferment in the church, being a prebendary of Westminster, and rector of Bosworth. He was a diligent justice of the peace, and presided over the town of Ashbourne, to the inhabitants of which I was told he was very liberal; and as a proof of this it was mentioned to me, he had the preceding winter distributed two hundred pounds among such of them as stood in need of his assistance. He had consequently a considerable political interest in the county of Derby, which he employed to support the Devonshire family; for though the schoolfellow and friend of Johnson, he was a Whig. I could not perceive in his character much congeniality of any sort with that of Johnson, who, however, said to me, &lsquo;Sir, he has a very strong understanding.&rsquo; His size, and figure, and countenance, and manner, were that of a hearty English &lsquo;Squire, with the parson super-induced: and I took particular notice of his upper servant, Mr. Peters, a decent grave man, in purple clothes, and a large white wig, like the butler or major domo of a Bishop.</p>
<p class="p24">Dr. Johnson and Dr. Taylor met with great cordiality; and Johnson soon gave him the same sad account of their school-fellow, Congreve, that he had given to Mr. Hector; adding a remark of such moment to the rational conduct of a man in the decline of life, that it deserves to be imprinted upon every mind: &lsquo;There is nothing against which an old man should be so much upon his guard as putting himself to nurse. Innumerable have been the melancholy instances of men once distinguished for firmness, resolution, and spirit, who in their latter days have been governed like children, by interested female artifice.</p>
<p class="p24">Dr. Taylor commended a physician who was known to him and Dr. Johnson, and said, &lsquo;I fight many battles for him, as many people in the country dislike him.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;But you should consider, Sir, that by every one of your victories he is a loser; for, every man of whom you get the better, will be very angry, and resolve not to employ him; whereas if people get the better of you in argument about him, they&rsquo;ll think, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll send for Dr. ****** nevertheless.&rdquo;&rsquo; This was an observation deep and sure in human nature.</p>
<p class="p24">Next day, as Dr. Johnson had acquainted Dr. Taylor of the reason for his returning speedily to London, it was resolved that we should set out after dinner. A few of Dr. Taylor&rsquo;s neighbours were his guests that day.</p>
<p class="p24">Dr. Johnson talked with approbation of one who had attained to the state of the philosophical wise man, that is to have no want of any thing. &lsquo;Then, Sir, (said I,) the savage is a wise man.&rsquo; &lsquo;Sir, (said he,) I do not mean simply being without, &mdash; but not having a want.&rsquo; I maintained, against this proposition, that it was better to have fine clothes, for instance, than not to feel the want of them. JOHNSON. &lsquo;No, Sir; fine clothes are good only as they supply the want of other means of procuring respect. Was Charles the Twelfth, think you, less respected for his coarse blue coat and black stock? And you find the King of Prussia dresses plain, because the dignity of his character is sufficient.&rsquo; I here brought myself into a scrape, for I heedlessly said, &lsquo;Would not YOU, Sir, be the better for velvet and embroidery?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, you put an end to all argument when you introduce your opponent himself. Have you no better manners? There is YOUR WANT.&rsquo; I apologised by saying, I had mentioned him as an instance of one who wanted as little as any man in the world, and yet, perhaps, might receive some additional lustre from dress.</p>
<p class="p24">Having left Ashbourne in the evening, we stopped to change horses at Derby, and availed ourselves of a moment to enjoy the conversation of my countryman, Dr. Butter, then physician there. He was in great indignation because Lord Mountstuart&rsquo;s bill for a Scotch militia had been lost. Dr. Johnson was as violent against it. &lsquo;I am glad, (said he,) that Parliament has had the spirit to throw it out. You wanted to take advantage of the timidity of our scoundrels;&rsquo; (meaning, I suppose, the ministry). It may be observed, that he used the epithet scoundrel very commonly not quite in the sense in which it is generally understood, but as a strong term of disapprobation; as when he abruptly answered Mrs. Thrale, who had asked him how he did, &lsquo;Ready to become a scoundrel, Madam; with a little more spoiling you will, I think, make me a complete rascal:&rsquo; he meant, easy to become a capricious and self-indulgent valetudinarian; a character for which I have heard him express great disgust. We lay this night at Loughborough.</p>
<p class="p24">On Thursday, March 28, we pursued our journey. He said, &lsquo;It is commonly a weak man who marries for love.&rsquo; We then talked of marrying women of fortune; and I mentioned a common remark, that a man may be, upon the whole, richer by marrying a woman with a very small portion, because a woman of fortune will be proportionally expensive; whereas a woman who brings none will be very moderate in expenses. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Depend upon it, Sir, this is not true. A woman of fortune being used to the handling of money, spends it judiciously: but a woman who gets the command of money for the first time upon her marriage, has such a gust in spending it, that she throws it away with great profusion.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He praised the ladies of the present age, insisting that they were more faithful to their husbands, and more virtuous in every respect, than in former times, because their understandings were better cultivated.</p>
<p class="p24">At Leicester we read in the news-paper that Dr. James was dead. I thought that the death of an old school-fellow, and one with whom he had lived a good deal in London, would have affected my fellow-traveller much: but he only said, Ah! poor Jamy.&rsquo; Afterwards, however, when we were in the chaise, he said, with more tenderness, &lsquo;Since I set out on this jaunt, I have lost an old friend and a young one; &mdash; Dr. James, and poor Harry.&rsquo; (Meaning Mr. Thrale&rsquo;s son.)</p>
<p class="p24">I enjoyed the luxury of our approach to London, that metropolis which we both loved so much, for the high and varied intellectual pleasure which it furnishes. I experienced immediate happiness while whirled along with such a companion, and said to him, &lsquo;Sir, you observed one day at General Oglethorpe&rsquo;s, that a man is never happy for the present, but when he is drunk. Will you not add, &mdash; or when driving rapidly in a post-chaise?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;No, Sir, you are driving rapidly FROM something, or TO something.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Talking of melancholy, he said, &lsquo;Some men, and very thinking men too, have not those vexing thoughts. Sir Joshua Reynolds is the same all the year round. Beauclerk, except when ill and in pain, is the same. But I believe most men have them in the degree in which they are capable of having them. If I were in the country, and were distressed by that malady, I would force myself to take a book; and every time I did it I should find it the easier. Melancholy, indeed, should be diverted by every means but drinking.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">We stopped at Messieurs Dillys, booksellers in the Poultry; from whence he hurried away, in a hackney coach, to Mr. Thrale&rsquo;s, in the Borough. I called at his house in the evening, having promised to acquaint Mrs. Williams of his safe return; when, to my surprize, I found him sitting with her at tea, and, as I thought, not in a very good humour: for, it seems, when he had got to Mr. Thrale&rsquo;s, he found the coach was at the door waiting to carry Mrs. and Miss Thrale, and Signor Baretti, their Italian master, to Bath. This was not shewing the attention which might have been expected to the &lsquo;Guide, Philosopher, and Friend,&rsquo; the Imlac who had hastened from the country to console a distressed mother, who he understood was very anxious for his return. They had, I found, without ceremony, proceeded on their intended journey. I was glad to understand from him that it was still resolved that his tour to Italy with Mr. and Mrs. Thrale should take place, of which he had entertained some doubt, on account of the loss which they had suffered; and his doubts afterwards proved to be well-founded. He observed, indeed very justly, that &lsquo;their loss was an additional reason for their going abroad; and if it had not been fixed that he should have been one of the party, he would force them out; but he would not advise them unless his advice was asked, lest they might suspect that he recommended what he wished on his own account.&rsquo; I was not pleased that his intimacy with Mr. Thrale&rsquo;s family, though it no doubt contributed much to his comfort and enjoyment, was not without some degree of restraint: not, as has been grossly suggested, that it was required of him as a task to talk for the entertainment of them and their company; but that he was not quite at his ease; which, however, might partly be owing to his own honest pride &mdash; that dignity of mind which is always jealous of appearing too compliant.</p>
<p class="p24">On Sunday, March 31, I called on him, and shewed him as a curiosity which I had discovered, his Translation of Lobo&rsquo;s Account of Abyssinia, which Sir John Pringle had lent me, it being then little known as one of his works. He said, &lsquo;Take no notice of it,&rsquo; or &lsquo;don&rsquo;t talk of it.&rsquo; He seemed to think it beneath him, though done at six-and-twenty. I said to him, &lsquo;Your style, Sir, is much improved since you translated this.&rsquo; He answered with a sort of triumphant smile, &lsquo;Sir, I hope it is.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Wednesday, April 3, in the morning I found him very busy putting his books in order, and as they were generally very old ones, clouds of dust were flying around him. He had on a pair of large gloves such as hedgers use. His present appearance put me in mind of my uncle, Dr. Boswell&rsquo;s description of him, &lsquo;A robust genius, born to grapple with whole libraries.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He had been in company with Omai, a native of one of the South Sea Islands, after he had been some time in this country. He was struck with the elegance of his behaviour, and accounted for it thus: &lsquo;Sir, he had passed his time, while in England, only in the best company; so that all that he had acquired of our manners was genteel. As a proof of this, Sir, Lord Mulgrave and he dined one day at Streatham; they sat with their backs to the light fronting me, so that I could not see distinctly; and there was so little of the savage in Omai, that I was afraid to speak to either, lest I should mistake one for the other.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">We agreed to dine to-day at the Mitre-tavern after the rising of the House of Lords, where a branch of the litigation concerning the Douglas Estate, in which I was one of the counsel, was to come on.</p>
<p class="p24">I introduced the topick, which is often ignorantly urged, that the Universities of England are too rich; so that learning does not flourish in them as it would do, if those who teach had smaller salaries, and depended on their assiduity for a great part of their income. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, the very reverse of this is the truth; the English Universities are not rich enough. Our fellowships are only sufficient to support a man during his studies to fit him for the world, and accordingly in general they are held no longer than till an opportunity offers of getting away. Now and then, perhaps, there is a fellow who grows old in his college; but this is against his will, unless he be a man very indolent indeed. A hundred a year is reckoned a good fellowship, and that is no more than is necessary to keep a man decently as a scholar. We do not allow our fellows to marry, because we consider academical institutions as preparatory to a settlement in the world. It is only by being employed as a tutor, that a fellow can obtain any thing more than a livelihood. To be sure a man, who has enough without teaching, will probably not teach; for we would all be idle if we could. In the same manner, a man who is to get nothing by teaching, will not exert himself. Gresham College was intended as a place of instruction for London; able professors were to read lectures gratis, they contrived to have no scholars; whereas, if they had been allowed to receive but sixpence a lecture from each scholar, they would have been emulous to have had many scholars. Every body will agree that it should be the interest of those who teach to have scholars and this is the case in our Universities. That they are too rich is certainly not true; for they have nothing good enough to keep a man of eminent learning with them for his life. In the foreign Universities a professorship is a high thing. It is as much almost as a man can make by his learning; and therefore we find the most learned men abroad are in the Universities. It is not so with us. Our Universities are impoverished of learning, by the penury of their provisions. I wish there were many places of a thousand a-year at Oxford, to keep first-rate men of learning from quitting the University.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I mentioned Mr. Maclaurin&rsquo;s uneasiness on account of a degree of ridicule carelessly thrown on his deceased father, in Goldsmith&rsquo;s History of Animated Nature, in which that celebrated mathematician is represented as being subject to fits of yawning so violent as to render him incapable of proceeding in his lecture; a story altogether unfounded, but for the publication of which the law would give no reparation. This led us to agitate the question, whether legal redress could be obtained, even when a man&rsquo;s deceased relation was calumniated in a publication.</p>
<p class="p24">On Friday, April 5, being Good Friday, after having attended the morning service at St. Clement&rsquo;s Church, I walked home with Johnson. We talked of the Roman Catholick religion. JOHNSON. &lsquo;In the barbarous ages, Sir, priests and people were equally deceived; but afterwards there were gross corruptions introduced by the clergy, such as indulgencies to priests to have concubines, and the worship of images, not, indeed, inculcated, but knowingly permitted.&rsquo; He strongly censured the licensed stews at Rome. BOSWELL. &lsquo;So then, Sir, you would allow of no irregular intercourse whatever between the sexes?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;To be sure I would not, Sir. I would punish it much more than it is done, and so restrain it. In all countries there has been fornication, as in all countries there has been theft; but there may be more or less of the one, as well as of the other, in proportion to the force of law. All men will naturally commit fornication, as all men will naturally steal. And, Sir, it is very absurd to argue, as has been often done, that prostitutes are necessary to prevent the violent effects of appetite from violating the decent order of life; nay, should be permitted, in order to preserve the chastity of our wives and daughters. Depend upon it, Sir, severe laws, steadily enforced, would be sufficient against those evils, and would promote marriage.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Mr. Thrale called upon him, and appeared to bear the loss of his son with a manly composure. There was no affectation about him; and he talked, as usual, upon indifferent subjects. He seemed to me to hesitate as to the intended Italian tour, on which, I flattered myself, he and Mrs. Thrale and Dr. Johnson were soon to set out; and, therefore, I pressed it as much as I could. I mentioned, that Mr. Beauclerk had said, that Baretti, whom they were to carry with them, would keep them so long in the little towns of his own district, that they would not have time to see Rome. I mentioned this, to put them on their guard. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, we do not thank Mr. Beauclerk for supposing that we are to be directed by Baretti. No, Sir; Mr. Thrale is to go, by my advice, to Mr. Jackson, (the all-knowing) and get from him a plan for seeing the most that can be seen in the time that we have to travel. We must, to be sure, see Rome, Naples, Florence, and Venice, and as much more as we can.&rsquo; (Speaking with a tone of animation.)</p>
<p class="p24">When I expressed an earnest wish for his remarks on Italy, he said, &lsquo;I do not see that I could make a book upon Italy; yet I should be glad to get two hundred pounds, or five hundred pounds, by such a work.&rsquo; This shewed both that a journal of his Tour upon the Continent was not wholly out of his contemplation, and that he uniformly adhered to that strange opinion, which his indolent disposition made him utter: &lsquo;No man but a blockhead ever wrote, except for money.&rsquo; Numerous instances to refute this will occur to all who are versed in the history of literature.</p>
<p class="p24">He gave us one of the many sketches of character which were treasured in his mind, and which he was wont to produce quite unexpectedly in a very entertaining manner. &lsquo;I lately, (said he,) received a letter from the East Indies, from a gentleman whom I formerly knew very well; he had returned from that country with a handsome fortune, as it was reckoned, before means were found to acquire those immense sums which have been brought from thence of late; he was a scholar, and an agreeable man, and lived very prettily in London, till his wife died. After her death, he took to dissipation and gaming, and lost all he had. One evening he lost a thousand pounds to a gentleman whose name I am sorry I have forgotten. Next morning he sent the gentleman five hundred pounds, with an apology that it was all he had in the world. The gentleman sent the money back to him, declaring he would not accept of it; and adding, that if Mr. &mdash;&mdash;&nbsp; &mdash; had occasion for five hundred pounds more, he would lend it to him. He resolved to go out again to the East Indies, and make his fortune anew. He got a considerable appointment, and I had some intention of accompanying him. Had I thought then as I do now, I should have gone: but, at that time, I had objections to quitting England.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">It was a very remarkable circumstance about Johnson, whom shallow observers have supposed to have been ignorant of the world, that very few men had seen greater variety of characters; and none could observe them better, as was evident from the strong, yet nice portraits which he often drew. I have frequently thought that if he had made out what the French call une catalogue raisonnee of all the people who had passed under his observation, it would have afforded a very rich fund of instruction and entertainment. The suddenness with which his accounts of some of them started out in conversation, was not less pleasing than surprizing. I remember he once observed to me, &lsquo;It is wonderful, Sir, what is to be found in London. The most literary conversation that I ever enjoyed, was at the table of Jack Ellis, a money-scrivener behind the Royal Exchange, with whom I at one period used to dine generally once a week.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Volumes would be required to contain a list of his numerous and various acquaintance, none of whom he ever forgot; and could describe and discriminate them all with precision and vivacity. He associated with persons the most widely different in manners, abilities, rank, and accomplishments. He was at once the companion of the brilliant Colonel Forrester of the Guards, who wrote The Polite Philosopher, and of the aukward and uncouth Robert Levet; of Lord Thurlow, and Mr. Sastres, the Italian master; and has dined one day with the beautiful, gay, and fascinating Lady Craven, and the next with good Mrs. Gardiner, the tallow-chandler, on Snow-hill.</p>
<p class="p24">On my expressing my wonder at his discovering so much of the knowledge peculiar to different professions, he told me, &lsquo;I learnt what I know of law, chiefly from Mr. Ballow, a very able man. I learnt some, too, from Chambers; but was not so teachable then. One is not willing to be taught by a young man.&rsquo; When I expressed a wish to know more about Mr. Ballow, Johnson said, &lsquo;Sir, I have seen him but once these twenty years. The tide of life has driven us different ways.&rsquo; I was sorry at the time to hear this; but whoever quits the creeks of private connections, and fairly gets into the great ocean of London, will, by imperceptible degrees, unavoidably experience such cessations of acquaintance.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;My knowledge of physick, (he added,) I learnt from Dr. James, whom I helped in writing the proposals for his Dictionary and also a little in the Dictionary itself. I also learnt from Dr. Lawrence, but was then grown more stubborn.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">A curious incident happened to-day, while Mr. Thrale and I sat with him. Francis announced that a large packet was brought to him from the post-office, said to have come from Lisbon, and it was charged SEVEN POUNDS TEN SHILLINGS. He would not receive it, supposing it to be some trick, nor did he even look at it. But upon enquiry afterwards he found that it was a real packet for him, from that very friend in the East Indies of whom he had been speaking; and the ship which carried it having come to Portugal, this packet, with others, had been put into the post-office at Lisbon.</p>
<p class="p24">I mentioned a new gaming-club, of which Mr. Beauclerk had given me an account, where the members played to a desperate extent. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Depend upon it, Sir, this is mere talk. WHO is ruined by gaming? You will not find six instances in an age. There is a strange rout made about deep play: whereas you have many more people ruined by adventurous trade, and yet we do not hear such an outcry against it.&rsquo; THRALE. &lsquo;There may be few people absolutely ruined by deep play; but very many are much hurt in their circumstances by it.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Yes, Sir, and so are very many by other kinds of expence.&rsquo; I had heard him talk once before in the same manner; and at Oxford he said, &lsquo;he wished he had learnt to play at cards.&rsquo; The truth, however, is, that he loved to display his ingenuity in argument; and therefore would sometimes in conversation maintain opinions which he was sensible were wrong, but in supporting which, his reasoning and wit would be most conspicuous. He would begin thus: &lsquo;Why, Sir, as to the good or evil of card-playing&mdash; &lsquo; &lsquo;Now, (said Garrick,) he is thinking which side he shall take.&rsquo; He appeared to have a pleasure in contradiction, especially when any opinion whatever was delivered with an air of confidence; so that there was hardly any topick, if not one of the great truths of Religion and Morality, that he might not have been incited to argue, either for or against. Lord Elibank had the highest admiration of his powers. He once observed to me, &lsquo;Whatever opinion Johnson maintains, I will not say that he convinces me; but he never fails to shew me, that he has good reasons for it.&rsquo; I have heard Johnson pay his Lordship this high compliment: &lsquo;I never was in Lord Elibank&rsquo;s company without learning something.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">We sat together till it was too late for the afternoon service. Thrale said he had come with intention to go to church with us. We went at seven to evening prayers at St. Clement&rsquo;s church, after having drank coffee; an indulgence, which I understood Johnson yielded to on this occasion, in compliment to Thrale.</p>
<p class="p24">On Sunday, April 7, Easter-day, after having been at St. Paul&rsquo;s Cathedral, I came to Dr. Johnson, according to my usual custom. It seemed to me, that there was always something peculiarly mild and placid in his manner upon this holy festival, the commemoration of the most joyful event in the history of our world, the resurrection of our LORD and SAVIOUR, who, having triumphed over death and the grave, proclaimed immortality to mankind.</p>
<p class="p24">I repeated to him an argument of a lady of my acquaintance, who maintained, that her husband&rsquo;s having been guilty of numberless infidelities, released her from conjugal obligations, because they were reciprocal. JOHNSON. &lsquo;This is miserable stuff, Sir. To the contract of marriage, besides the man and wife, there is a third party &mdash; Society; and if it be considered as a vow &mdash; GOD: and, therefore, it cannot be dissolved by their consent alone. Laws are not made for particular cases, but for men in general. A woman may be unhappy with her husband; but she cannot be freed from him without the approbation of the civil and ecclesiastical power. A man may be unhappy, because he is not so rich as another; but he is not to seize upon another&rsquo;s property with his own hand.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;But, Sir, this lady does not want that the contract should be dissolved; she only argues that she may indulge herself in gallantries with equal freedom as her husband does, provided she takes care not to introduce a spurious issue into his family. You know, Sir, what Macrobius has told us of Julia.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;This lady of yours, Sir, I think, is very fit for a brothel.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Mr. Macbean, authour of the Dictionary of ancient Geography, came in. He mentioned that he had been forty years absent from Scotland. &lsquo;Ah, Boswell! (said Johnson, smiling,) what would you give to be forty years from Scotland?&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;I should not like to be so long absent from the seat of my ancestors.&rsquo; This gentleman, Mrs. Williams, and Mr. Levet, dined with us.</p>
<p class="p24">Mrs. Williams was very peevish; and I wondered at Johnson&rsquo;s patience with her now, as I had often done on similar occasions. The truth is, that his humane consideration of the forlorn and indigent state in which this lady was left by her father, induced him to treat her with the utmost tenderness, and even to be desirous of procuring her amusement, so as sometimes to incommode many of his friends, by carrying her with him to their houses, where, from her manner of eating, in consequence of her blindness, she could not but offend the delicacy of persons of nice sensations.</p>
<p class="p24">After coffee, we went to afternoon service in St. Clement&rsquo;s church. Observing some beggars in the street as we walked along, I said to him I supposed there was no civilized country in the world, where the misery of want in the lowest classes of the people was prevented. JOHNSON. &lsquo;I believe, Sir, there is not; but it is better that some should be unhappy, than that none should be happy, which would be the case in a general state of equality.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">When the service was ended, I went home with him, and we sat quietly by ourselves.</p>
<p class="p24">Upon the question whether a man who had been guilty of vicious actions would do well to force himself into solitude and sadness; JOHNSON. &lsquo;No, Sir, unless it prevent him from being vicious again. With some people, gloomy penitence is only madness turned upside down. A man may be gloomy, till, in order to be relieved from gloom, he has recourse again to criminal indulgencies.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Wednesday, April 10, I dined with him at Mr. Thrale&rsquo;s, where were Mr. Murphy and some other company. Before dinner, Dr. Johnson and I passed some time by ourselves. I was sorry to find it was now resolved that the proposed journey to Italy should not take place this year. He said, &lsquo;I am disappointed, to be sure; but it is not a great disappointment.&rsquo; I wondered to see him bear, with a philosophical calmness, what would have made most people peevish and fretful. I perceived, however, that he had so warmly cherished the hope of enjoying classical scenes, that he could not easily part with the scheme; for he said: &lsquo;I shall probably contrive to get to Italy some other way. But I won&rsquo;t mention it to Mr. and Mrs. Thrale, as it might vex them.&rsquo; I suggested, that going to Italy might have done Mr. and Mrs. Thrale good. JOHNSON. &lsquo;I rather believe not, Sir. While grief is fresh, every attempt to divert only irritates. You must wait till grief be DIGESTED, and then amusement will dissipate the remains of it.&rsquo;</p>
