The network infrastructure connects to four different coverage areas, which are depicted as circles shaded light blue. A key identifies the three elements included in these coverage areas: a base station, identified here as a "Wireless access point;" a laptop computer, identified here as a "Wireless host;" and a second laptop computer that is shaded in blue and overlaid with an arrow pointing to the right, which is identified here as a "Wireless host in motion."</p><p id="P700101195200000000000000000B2C5" data-uri="M07_KURO4140_07_SE_C07.xhtml#P700101195200000000000000000B2C5">There are two coverage areas above the network infrastructure-one to the left and one to the right. The coverage area to the left contains four wireless hosts and one wireless access point; the coverage area to the right contains three hosts and one access point.</p><p id="P700101195200000000000000000B2C6" data-uri="M07_KURO4140_07_SE_C07.xhtml#P700101195200000000000000000B2C6">There are two coverage areas below the network infrastructure, positioned side-by-side and with a small area of overlap between the two. The coverage area to the left contains four wireless hosts and one wireless access point; the coverage area to the right contains one host and one access point. In the area where the two areas overlap is a wireless host in motion.</p></div></section></body></html>
