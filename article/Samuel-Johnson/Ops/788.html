<h2 class="h20"><a id="a1917"></a>ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA.</h2>
<p class="p21">This play keeps curiosity always busy, and the passions always interested. The continual hurry of the action, the variety of incidents, and the quick succession of one personage to another, call the mind forward, without intermission, from the first act to the last. But the power of delighting is derived principally from the frequent changes of the scene; for, except the feminine arts, some of which are too low, which distinguish Cleopatra, no character is very strongly discriminated. Upton, who did not easily miss what he desired to find, has discovered that the language of Antony is, with great skill and learning, made pompous and superb, according to his real practice. But I think his diction not distinguishable from that of others: the most tumid speech in the play is that which CÃ¦sar makes to Octavia.</p>
<p class="p24">The events, of which the principal are described according to history, are produced without any art of connexion or care of disposition.</p>
