<p class="p24">&lsquo;The debate between Dr. Percy and me is one of those foolish controversies, which begin upon a question of which neither party cares how it is decided, and which is, nevertheless, continued to acrimony, by the vanity with which every man resists confutation. Dr. Percy&rsquo;s warmth proceeded from a cause which, perhaps, does him more honour than he could have derived from juster criticism. His abhorrence of Pennant proceeded from his opinion that Pennant had wantonly and indecently censured his patron. His anger made him resolve, that, for having been once wrong, he never should be right. Pennant has much in his notions that I do not like; but still I think him a very intelligent traveller. If Percy is really offended, I am sorry; for he is a man whom I never knew to offend any one. He is a man very willing to learn, and very able to teach; a man, out of whose company I never go without having learned something. It is sure that he vexes me sometimes, but I am afraid it is by making me feel my own ignorance. So much extension of mind, and so much minute accuracy of enquiry, if you survey your whole circle of acquaintance, you will find so scarce, if you find it at all, that you will value Percy by comparison. Lord Hailes is somewhat like him: but Lord Hailes does not, perhaps, go beyond him in research; and I do not know that he equals him in elegance. Percy&rsquo;s attention to poetry has given grace and splendour to his studies of antiquity. A mere antiquarian is a rugged being.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Upon the whole, you see that what I might say in sport or petulance to him, is very consistent with full conviction of his merit.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am, dear Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your most, &amp;c.,</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;April 23, 1778.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">&lsquo;TO THE REVEREND DR. PERCY, NORTHUMBERLAND-HOUSE.</span></p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I wrote to Dr. Johnson on the subject of the <span class="t8">Pennantian</span> controversy; and have received from him an answer which will delight you. I read it yesterday to Dr. Robertson, at the Exhibition; and at dinner to Lord Percy, General Oglethorpe, &amp;c. who dined with us at General Paoli&rsquo;s; who was also a witness to the high <span class="t8">testimony</span> to your honour.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;General Paoli desires the favour of your company next Tuesday to dinner, to meet Dr. Johnson. If I can, I will call on you to-day. I am, with sincere regard,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your most obedient humble servant,</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;JAMES BOSWELL.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;South Audley-street, April 25.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Monday, April 13, I dined with Johnson at Mr. Langton&rsquo;s, where were Dr. Porteus, then Bishop of Chester, now of London, and Dr. Stinton. He was at first in a very silent mood. Before dinner he said nothing but &lsquo;Pretty baby,&rsquo; to one of the children. Langton said very well to me afterwards, that he could repeat Johnson&rsquo;s conversation before dinner, as Johnson had said that he could repeat a complete chapter of <span class="t8">The Natural History of Iceland</span>, from the Danish of <span class="t8">Horrebow</span>, the whole of which was exactly thus: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;CHAP. LXXII. <span class="t8">Concerning snakes</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;There are no snakes to be met with throughout the whole island.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">At dinner we talked of another mode in the newspapers of giving modern characters in sentences from the classicks, and of the passage</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;Pareus deorum cultor, et infrequens,<br/>Insanientis dum sapientiæ<br/>Consultus erro, nunc retrorsùm<br/>Vela dare, atque iterare cursus<br/>Cogor relictos:&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">being well applied to Soame Jenyns; who, after having wandered in the wilds of infidelity, had returned to the Christian faith. Mr. Langton asked Johnson as to the propriety of <span class="t8">sapientiæ consultus</span>. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Though <span class="t8">consultus</span> was primarily an adjective, like <span class="t8">amicus</span> it came to be used as a substantive. So we have <span class="t8">Juris consultus</span>, a consult in law.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">We talked of the styles of different painters, and how certainly a connoisseur could distinguish them; I asked, if there was as clear a difference of styles in language as in painting, or even as in hand-writing, so that the composition of every individual may be distinguished? JOHNSON. &lsquo;Yes. Those who have a style of eminent excellence, such as Dryden and Milton, can always be distinguished.&rsquo; I had no doubt of this, but what I wanted to know was, whether there was really a peculiar style to every man whatever, as there is certainly a peculiar handwriting, a peculiar countenance, not widely different in many, yet always enough to be distinctive: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;… <span class="t8">facies non omnibus una, Nec diversa tamen</span>.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">The Bishop thought not; and said, he supposed that many pieces in Dodsley&rsquo;s collection of poems, though all very pretty, had nothing appropriated in their style, and in that particular could not be at all distinguished. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, I think every man whatever has a peculiar style, which may be discovered by nice examination and comparison with others: but a man must write a great deal to make his style obviously discernible. As logicians say, this appropriation of style is infinite in <span class="t8">potestate</span>, limited <span class="t8">in actu</span>.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Mr. Topham Beauclerk came in the evening, and he and Dr. Johnson and I staid to supper. It was mentioned that Dr. Dodd had once wished to be a member of THE LITERARY CLUB. JOHNSON. &lsquo;I should be sorry if any of our Club were hanged. I will not say but some of them deserve it.&rsquo; BEAUCLERK; (supposing this to be aimed at persons for whom he had at that time a wonderful fancy, which, however, did not last long,) was irritated, and eagerly said, &lsquo;You, Sir, have a friend, (naming him) who deserves to be hanged; for he speaks behind their backs against those with whom he lives on the best terms, and attacks them in the newspapers. <span class="t8">He</span> certainly ought to be <span class="t8">kicked</span>.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, we all do this in some degree, &ldquo;<span class="t8">Veniam petimus damusque vicissim</span>.&rdquo; To be sure it may be done so much, that a man may deserve to be kicked.&rsquo; BEAUCLERK. &lsquo;He is very malignant.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;No, Sir; he is not malignant. He is mischievous, if you will. He would do no man an essential injury; he may, indeed, love to make sport of people by vexing their vanity. I, however, once knew an old gentleman who was absolutely malignant. He really wished evil to others, and rejoiced at it.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;The gentleman, Mr. Beauclerk, against whom you are so violent, is, I know, a man of good principles.&rsquo; BEAUCLERK. &lsquo;Then he does not wear them out in practice.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Dr. Johnson, who, as I have observed before, delighted in discrimination of character, and having a masterly knowledge of human nature, was willing to take men as they are, imperfect and with a mixture of good and bad qualities, I suppose thought he had said enough in defence of his friend, of whose merits, notwithstanding his exceptional points, he had a just value; and added no more on the subject.</p>
<p class="p24">On Tuesday, April 14, I dined with him at General Oglethorpe&rsquo;s, with General Paoli and Mr. Langton. General Oglethorpe declaimed against luxury. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Depend upon it, Sir, every state of society is as luxurious as it can be. Men always take the best they can get.&rsquo; OGLETHORPE. &lsquo;But the best depends much upon ourselves; and if we can be as well satisfied with plain things, we are in the wrong to accustom our palates to what is high-seasoned and expensive. What says Addison in his <span class="t8">Cato</span>, speaking of the Numidian?</p>
<p class="p26">&ldquo;Coarse are his meals, the fortune of the chace,<br/>Amid the running stream he slakes his thirst,<br/>Toils all the day, and at the approach of night,<br/>On the first friendly bank he throws him down,<br/>Or rests his head upon a rock till morn;<br/>And if the following day he chance to find<br/>A new repast, or an untasted spring,<br/>Blesses his stars, and thinks it&rsquo;s luxury.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Let us have <span class="t8">that</span> kind of luxury, Sir, if you will.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;But hold, Sir; to be merely satisfied is not enough. It is in refinement and elegance that the civilized man differs from the savage. A great part of our industry, and all our ingenuity is exercised in procuring pleasure; and, Sir, a hungry man has not the same pleasure in eating a plain dinner, that a hungry man has in eating a luxurious dinner. You see I put the case fairly. A hungry man may have as much, nay, more pleasure in eating a plain dinner, than a man grown fastidious has in eating a luxurious dinner. But I suppose the man who decides between the two dinners, to be equally a hungry man.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Talking of different governments, &mdash; JOHNSON. &lsquo;The more contracted that power is, the more easily it is destroyed. A country governed by a despot is an inverted cone. Government there cannot be so firm, as when it rests upon a broad basis gradually contracted, as the government of Great Britain, which is founded on the parliament, then is in the privy council, then in the King.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Power, when contracted into the person of a despot, may be easily destroyed, as the prince may be cut off. So Caligula wished that the people of Rome had but one neck, that he might cut them off at a blow.&rsquo; OGLETHORPE. &lsquo;It was of the Senate he wished that. The Senate by its usurpation controlled both the Emperour and the people. And don&rsquo;t you think that we see too much of that in our own Parliament?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Dr. Johnson endeavoured to trace the etymology of Maccaronick verses, which he thought were of Italian invention from Maccaroni; but on being informed that this would infer that they were the most common and easy verses, maccaroni being the most ordinary and simple food, he was at a loss; for he said, &lsquo;He rather should have supposed it to import in its primitive signification, a composition of several things; for Maccaronick verses are verses made out of a mixture of different languages, that is, of one language with the termination of another.&rsquo; I suppose we scarcely know of a language in any country where there is any learning, in which that motley ludicrous species of composition may not be found. It is particularly droll in Low Dutch. The <span class="t8">Polemomiddinia</span> of Drummond of Hawthornden, in which there is a jumble of many languages moulded, as if it were all in Latin, is well known. Mr. Langton made us laugh heartily at one in the Grecian mould, by Joshua Barnes, in which are to be found such comical <span class="t8">Anglo-Ellenisms</span> as [Greek: Klubboisin ebanchthen]: they were banged with clubs.</p>
<p class="p24">On Wednesday, April 15, I dined with Dr. Johnson at Mr. Dilly&rsquo;s, and was in high spirits, for I had been a good part of the morning with Mr. Orme, the able and eloquent historian of Hindostan, who expressed a great admiration of Johnson. &lsquo;I do not care (said he,) on what subject Johnson talks; but I love better to hear him talk than any body. He either gives you new thoughts, or a new colouring. It is a shame to the nation that he has not been more liberally rewarded. Had I been George the Third, and thought as he did about America, I would have given Johnson three hundred a year for his <span class="t8">Taxation no Tyranny</span> alone.&rsquo; I repeated this, and Johnson was much pleased with such praise from such a man as Orme.</p>
<p class="p24">At Mr. Dilly&rsquo;s to-day were Mrs. Knowles, the ingenious Quaker lady, Miss Seward, the poetess of Lichfield, the Reverend Dr. Mayo, and the Rev. Mr. Beresford, Tutor to the Duke of Bedford. Before dinner Dr. Johnson seized upon Mr. Charles Sheridan&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Account of the late Revolution in Sweden</span>, and seemed to read it ravenously, as if he devoured it, which was to all appearance his method of studying. &lsquo;He knows how to read better than any one (said Mrs. Knowles;) he gets at the substance of a book directly; he tears out the heart of it.&rsquo; He kept it wrapt up in the tablecloth in his lap during the time of dinner, from an avidity to have one entertainment in readiness when he should have finished another; resembling (if I may use so coarse a simile) a dog who holds a bone in his paws in reserve, while he eats something else which has been thrown to him.</p>
<p class="p24">The subject of cookery having been very naturally introduced at a table where Johnson, who boasted of the niceness of his palate, owned that &lsquo;he always found a good dinner,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;I could write a better book of cookery than has ever yet been written; it should be a book upon philosophical principles. Pharmacy is now made much more simple. Cookery may be made so too. A prescription which is now compounded of five ingredients, had formerly fifty in it. So in cookery, if the nature of the ingredients be well known, much fewer will do. Then as you cannot make bad meat good, I would tell what is the best butcher&rsquo;s meat, the best beef, the best pieces; how to choose young fowls; the proper seasons of different vegetables; and then how to roast and boil, and compound.&rsquo; DILLY. &lsquo;Mrs. Glasse&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Cookery</span>, which is the best, was written by Dr. Hill. Half the <span class="t8">trade</span> know this.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Well, Sir. This shews how much better the subject of cookery may be treated by a philosopher. I doubt if the book be written by Dr. Hill; for, in Mrs. Glasse&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Cookery</span>, which I have looked into, salt-petre and sal-prunella are spoken of as different substances, whereas sal-prunella is only salt-petre burnt on charcoal; and Hill could not be ignorant of this. However, as the greatest part of such a book is made by transcription, this mistake may have been carelessly adopted. But you shall see what a Book of Cookery I shall make! I shall agree with Mr. Dilly for the copy-right.&rsquo; Miss SEWARD. &lsquo;That would be Hercules with the distaff indeed.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;No, Madam. Women can spin very well; but they cannot make a good book of Cookery.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">JOHNSON. &lsquo;O! Mr. Dilly &mdash; you must know that an English Benedictine Monk at Paris has translated <span class="t8">The Duke of Berwick&rsquo;s Memoirs</span>, from the original French, and has sent them to me to sell. I offered them to Strahan, who sent them back with this answer:&mdash; &ldquo;That the first book he had published was the <span class="t8">Duke of Berwick&rsquo;s Life</span>, by which he had lost: and he hated the name.&rdquo; &mdash; Now I honestly tell you, that Strahan has refused them; but I also honestly tell you, that he did it upon no principle, for he never looked into them.&rsquo; DILLY. &lsquo;Are they well translated, Sir?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, very well &mdash; in a style very current and very clear. I have written to the Benedictine to give me an answer upon two points &mdash; What evidence is there that the letters are authentick? (for if they are not authentick they are nothing;) &mdash; And how long will it be before the original French is published? For if the French edition is not to appear for a considerable time, the translation will be almost as valuable as an original book. They will make two volumes in octavo; and I have undertaken to correct every sheet as it comes from the press.&rsquo; Mr. Dilly desired to see them, and said he would send for them. He asked Dr. Johnson if he would write a Preface to them. JOHNSON. &lsquo;No, Sir. The Benedictines were very kind to me, and I&rsquo;ll do what I undertook to do; but I will not mingle my name with them. I am to gain nothing by them. I&rsquo;ll turn them loose upon the world, and let them take their chance.&rsquo; DR. MAYO. &lsquo;Pray, Sir, are Ganganelli&rsquo;s letters authentick?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;No, Sir. Voltaire put the same question to the editor of them, that I did to Macpherson &mdash; Where are the originals?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Mrs. Knowles affected to complain that men had much more liberty allowed them than women. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Madam, women have all the liberty they should wish to have. We have all the labour and the danger, and the women all the advantage. We go to sea, we build houses, we do everything, in short, to pay our court to the women.&rsquo; MRS. KNOWLES. &lsquo;The Doctor reasons very wittily, but not convincingly. Now, take the instance of building; the mason&rsquo;s wife, if she is ever seen in liquor, is ruined; the mason may get himself drunk as often as he pleases, with little loss of character; nay, may let his wife and children starve.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Madam, you must consider, if the mason does get himself drunk, and let his wife and children starve, the parish will oblige him to find security for their maintenance. We have different modes of restraining evil. Stocks for the men, a ducking-stool for women, and a pound for beasts. If we require more perfection from women than from ourselves, it is doing them honour. And women have not the same temptations that we have: they may always live in virtuous company; men must mix in the world indiscriminately. If a woman has no inclination to do what is wrong being secured from it is no restraint to her. I am at liberty to walk into the Thames; but if I were to try it, my friends would restrain me in Bedlam, and I should be obliged to them.&rsquo; MRS. KNOWLES. &lsquo;Still, Doctor, I cannot help thinking it a hardship that more indulgence is allowed to men than to women. It gives a superiority to men, to which I do not see how they are entitled.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;It is plain, Madam, one or other must have the superiority. As Shakspeare says, &ldquo;If two men ride on a horse, one must ride behind.&rdquo;&rsquo; DILLY. &lsquo;I suppose, Sir, Mrs. Knowles would have them to ride in panniers, one on each side.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Then, Sir, the horse would throw them both.&rsquo; MRS. KNOWLES. &lsquo;Well, I hope that in another world the sexes will be equal.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;That is being too ambitious, Madam. <span class="t8">We</span> might as well desire to be equal with the angels. We shall all, I hope, be happy in a future state, but we must not expect to be all happy in the same degree. It is enough if we be happy according to our several capacities. A worthy carman will get to heaven as well as Sir Isaac Newton. Yet, though equally good, they will not have the same degrees of happiness.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Probably not.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Upon this subject I had once before sounded him, by mentioning the late Reverend Mr. Brown, of Utrecht&rsquo;s, image; that a great and small glass, though equally full, did not hold an equal quantity; which he threw out to refute David Hume&rsquo;s saying, that a little miss, going to dance at a ball, in a fine new dress, was as happy as a great oratour, after having made an eloquent and applauded speech. After some thought, Johnson said, &lsquo;I come over to the parson.&rsquo; As an instance of coincidence of thinking, Mr. Dilly told me, that Dr. King, a late dissenting minister in London, said to him, upon the happiness in a future state of good men of different capacities, &lsquo;A pail does not hold so much as a tub; but, if it be equally full, it has no reason to complain. Every Saint in heaven will have as much happiness as he can hold.&rsquo; Mr. Dilly thought this a clear, though a familiar illustration of the phrase, &lsquo;One star differeth from another in brightness.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Dr. Mayo having asked Johnson&rsquo;s opinion of Soame Jenyns&rsquo;s <span class="t8">View of the Internal Evidence of the Christian Religion</span>; &mdash; JOHNSON. &lsquo;I think it a pretty book; not very theological indeed; and there seems to be an affectation of ease and carelessness, as if it were not suitable to his character to be very serious about the matter.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;He may have intended this to introduce his book the better among genteel people, who might be unwilling to read too grave a treatise. There is a general levity in the age. We have physicians now with bag-wigs; may we not have airy divines, at least somewhat less solemn in their appearance than they used to be?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Jenyns might mean as you say.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;You should like his book, Mrs. Knowles, as it maintains, as you <span class="t8">friends</span> do, that courage is not a Christian virtue.&rsquo; MRS. KNOWLES. &lsquo;Yes, indeed, I like him there; but I cannot agree with him, that friendship is not a Christian virtue.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Madam, strictly speaking, he is right. All friendship is preferring the interest of a friend, to the neglect, or, perhaps, against the interest of others; so that an old Greek said, &ldquo;He that has <span class="t8">friends</span> has <span class="t8">no friend</span>.&rdquo; Now Christianity recommends universal benevolence, to consider all men as our brethren, which is contrary to the virtue of friendship, as described by the ancient philosophers. Surely, Madam, your sect must approve of this; for, you call all men <span class="t8">friends</span>.&rsquo; MRS. KNOWLES. &lsquo;We are commanded to do good to all men, &ldquo;but especially to them who are of the household of Faith.&rdquo;&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Well, Madam. The household of Faith is wide enough.&rsquo; MRS. KNOWLES. &lsquo;But, Doctor, our Saviour had twelve Apostles, yet there was <span class="t8">one</span> whom he <span class="t8">loved</span>. John was called &ldquo;the disciple whom JESUS loved.&rdquo;&rsquo; JOHNSON (with eyes sparkling benignantly). &lsquo;Very well, indeed, Madam. You have said very well.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;A fine application. Pray, Sir, had you ever thought of it?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;I had not, Sir.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">From this pleasing subject, he, I know not how or why, made a sudden transition to one upon which he was a violent aggressor; for he said, &lsquo;I am willing to love all mankind, <span class="t8">except an American</span>:&rsquo; and his inflammable corruption bursting into horrid fire, he &lsquo;breathed out threatenings and slaughter;&rsquo; calling them, &lsquo;Rascals &mdash; Robbers &mdash; Pirates;&rsquo; and exclaiming, he&rsquo;d &lsquo;burn and destroy them.&rsquo; Miss Seward, looking to him with mild but steady astonishment, said, &lsquo;Sir, this is an instance that we are always most violent against those whom we have injured.&rsquo; &mdash; He was irritated still more by this delicate and keen reproach; and roared out another tremendous volley, which one might fancy could be heard across the Atlantick. During this tempest I sat in great uneasiness, lamenting his heat of temper; till, by degrees, I diverted his attention to other topicks.</p>
<p class="p24">DR. MAYO (to Dr. Johnson). &lsquo;Pray, Sir, have you read <span class="t8">Edwards, of New England, on Grace</span>?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;No, Sir.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;It puzzled me so much as to the freedom of the human will, by stating, with wonderful acute ingenuity, our being actuated by a series of motives which we cannot resist, that the only relief I had was to forget it.&rsquo; MAYO. &lsquo;But he makes the proper distinction between moral and physical necessity.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Alas, Sir, they come both to the same thing. You may be bound as hard by chains when covered by leather, as when the iron appears. The argument for the moral necessity of human actions is always, I observe, fortified by supposing universal prescience to be one of the attributes of the Deity.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;You are surer that you are free, than you are of prescience; you are surer that you can lift up your finger or not as you please, than you are of any conclusion from a deduction of reasoning. But let us consider a little the objection from prescience. It is certain I am either to go home to-night or not; that does not prevent my freedom.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;That it is certain you are <span class="t8">either</span> to go home or not, does not prevent your freedom; because the liberty of choice between the two is compatible with that certainty. But if <span class="t8">one</span> of these events be certain <span class="t8">now</span>, you have no <span class="t8">future</span> power of volition. If it be certain you are to go home to-night, you <span class="t8">must</span> go home.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;If I am well acquainted with a man, I can judge with great probability how he will act in any case, without his being restrained by my judging. GOD may have this probability increased to certainty.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;When it is increased to <span class="t8">certainty</span>, freedom ceases, because that cannot be certainly foreknown, which is not certain at the time; but if it be certain at the time, it is a contradiction in terms to maintain that there can be afterwards any <span class="t8">contingency</span> dependent upon the exercise of will or any thing else.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;All theory is against the freedom of the will; all experience for it.&rsquo; &mdash; I did not push the subject any farther. I was glad to find him so mild in discussing a question of the most abstract nature, involved with theological tenets, which he generally would not suffer to be in any degree opposed.</p>
<p class="p24">He as usual defended luxury; &lsquo;You cannot spend money in luxury without doing good to the poor. Nay, you do more good to them by spending it in luxury, than by giving it: for by spending it in luxury, you make them exert industry, whereas by giving it, you keep them idle. I own, indeed, there may be more virtue in giving it immediately in charity, than in spending it in luxury; though there may be a pride in that too.&rsquo; Miss Seward asked, if this was not Mandeville&rsquo;s doctrine of &lsquo;private vices publick benefits.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;The fallacy of that book is, that Mandeville defines neither vices nor benefits. He reckons among vices everything that gives pleasure. He takes the narrowest system of morality, monastick morality, which holds pleasure itself to be a vice, such as eating salt with our fish, because it makes it eat better; and he reckons wealth as a publick benefit, which is by no means always true. Pleasure of itself is not a vice. Having a garden, which we all know to be perfectly innocent, is a great pleasure. At the same time, in this state of being there are many pleasures vices, which however are so immediately agreeable that we can hardly abstain from them. The happiness of Heaven will be, that pleasure and virtue will be perfectly consistent. Mandeville puts the case of a man who gets drunk in an alehouse; and says it is a publick benefit, because so much money is got by it to the publick. But it must be considered, that all the good gained by this, through the gradation of alehouse-keeper, brewer, maltster, and farmer, is overbalanced by the evil caused to the man and his family by his getting drunk. This is the way to try what is vicious, by ascertaining whether more evil than good is produced by it upon the whole, which is the case in all vice. It may happen that good is produced by vice; but not as vice; for instance, a robber may take money from its owner, and give it to one who will make a better use of it. Here is good produced; but not by the robbery as robbery, but as translation of property. I read Mandeville forty, or, I believe, fifty years ago. He did not puzzle me; he opened my views into real life very much. No, it is clear that the happiness of society depends on virtue. In Sparta, theft was allowed by general consent: theft, therefore, was <span class="t8">there</span> not a crime, but then there was no security; and what a life must they have had, when there was no security. Without truth there must be a dissolution of society. As it is, there is so little truth, that we are almost afraid to trust our ears; but how should we be, if falsehood were multiplied ten times? Society is held together by communication and information; and I remember this remark of Sir Thomas Brown&rsquo;s, &ldquo;Do the devils lie? No; for then Hell could not subsist.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Talking of Miss &mdash;&mdash; , a literary lady, he said, &lsquo;I was obliged to speak to Miss Reynolds, to let her know that I desired she would not flatter me so much.&rsquo; Somebody now observed, &lsquo;She flatters Garrick.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;She is in the right to flatter Garrick. She is in the right for two reasons; first, because she has the world with her, who have been praising Garrick these thirty years; and secondly, because she is rewarded for it by Garrick. Why should she flatter <span class="t8">me</span>? I can do nothing for her. Let her carry her praise to a better market. (Then turning to Mrs. Knowles). You, Madam, have been flattering me all the evening; I wish you would give Boswell a little now. If you knew his merit as well as I do, you would say a great deal; he is the best travelling companion in the world.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Somebody mentioned the Reverend Mr. Mason&rsquo;s prosecution of Mr. Murray, the bookseller, for having inserted in a collection of <span class="t8">Gray&rsquo;s Poems</span>, only fifty lines, of which Mr. Mason had still the exclusive property, under the statute of Queen Anne; and that Mr. Mason had persevered, notwithstanding his being requested to name his own terms of compensation. Johnson signified his displeasure at Mr. Mason&rsquo;s conduct very strongly; but added, by way of shewing that he was not surprized at it, &lsquo;Mason&rsquo;s a Whig.&rsquo; MRS. KNOWLES, (not hearing distinctly:) &lsquo;What! a Prig, Sir?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Worse, Madam; a Whig! But he is both.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I expressed a horrour at the thought of death. MRS. KNOWLES. &lsquo;Nay, thou should&rsquo;st not have a horrour for what is the gate of life.&rsquo; JOHNSON, (standing upon the hearth rolling about, with a serious, solemn, and somewhat gloomy air:) &lsquo;No rational man can die without uneasy apprehension.&rsquo; MRS. KNOWLES. &lsquo;The Scriptures tell us, &ldquo;The righteous shall have <span class="t8">hope</span> in his death.&rdquo;&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Yes, Madam; that is, he shall not have despair. But, consider, his hope of salvation must be founded on the terms on which it is promised that the mediation of our SAVIOUR shall be applied to us, &mdash; namely, obedience; and where obedience has failed, then, as suppletory to it, repentance. But what man can say that his obedience has been such, as he would approve of in another, or even in himself upon close examination, or that his repentance has not been such as to require being repented of? No man can be sure that his obedience and repentance will obtain salvation.&rsquo; MRS. KNOWLES. &lsquo;But divine intimation of acceptance may be made to the soul.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Madam, it may; but I should not think the better of a man who should tell me on his death-bed he was sure of salvation. A man cannot be sure himself that he has divine intimation of acceptance; much less can he make others sure that he has it.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Then, Sir, we must be contented to acknowledge that death is a terrible thing.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Yes, Sir. I have made no approaches to a state which can look on it as not terrible.&rsquo; MRS. KNOWLES, (seeming to enjoy a pleasing serenity in the persuasion of benignant divine light:) &lsquo;Does not St. Paul say, &ldquo;I have fought the good fight of faith, I have finished my course; henceforth is laid up for me a crown of life?&rdquo;&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Yes, Madam; but here was a man inspired, a man who had been converted by supernatural interposition.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;In prospect death is dreadful; but in fact we find that people die easy.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, most people have not <span class="t8">thought</span> much of the matter, so cannot <span class="t8">say</span> much, and it is supposed they die easy. Few believe it certain they are then to die; and those who do, set themselves to behave with resolution, as a man does who is going to be hanged. He is not the less unwilling to be hanged.&rsquo; MISS SEWARD. &lsquo;There is one mode of the fear of death, which is certainly absurd; and that is the dread of annihilation, which is only a pleasing sleep without a dream.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;It is neither pleasing, nor sleep; it is nothing. Now mere existence is so much better than nothing, that one would rather exist even in pain, than not exist.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;If annihilation be nothing, then existing in pain is not a comparative state, but is a positive evil, which I cannot think we should choose. I must be allowed to differ here; and it would lessen the hope of a future state founded on the argument, that the Supreme Being, who is good as he is great, will hereafter compensate for our present sufferings in this life. For if existence, such as we have it here, be comparatively a good, we have no reason to complain, though no more of it should be given to us. But if our only state of existence were in this world, then we might with some reason complain that we are so dissatisfied with our enjoyments compared with our desires.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;The lady confounds annihilation, which is nothing, with the apprehension of it, which is dreadful. It is in the apprehension of it that the horrour of annihilation consists.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Of John Wesley, he said, &lsquo;He can talk well on any subject.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Pray, Sir, what has he made of his story of a ghost?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, he believes it; but not on sufficient authority. He did not take time enough to examine the girl. It was at Newcastle, where the ghost was said to have appeared to a young woman several times, mentioning something about the right to an old house, advising application to be made to an attorney, which was done; and, at the same time, saying the attorney would do nothing, which proved to be the fact. &ldquo;This (says John) is a proof that a ghost knows our thoughts.&rdquo; Now (laughing) it is not necessary to know our thoughts, to tell that an attorney will sometimes do nothing. Charles Wesley, who is a more stationary man, does not believe the story. I am sorry that John did not take more pains to inquire into the evidence for it.&rsquo; MISS SEWARD, (with an incredulous smile:) &lsquo;What, Sir! about a ghost?&rsquo; JOHNSON, (with solemn vehemence:) &lsquo;Yes, Madam: this is a question which, after five thousand years, is yet undecided; a question, whether in theology or philosophy, one of the most important that can come before the human understanding.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Mrs. Knowles mentioned, as a proselyte to Quakerism, Miss &mdash;&mdash; , a young lady well known to Dr. Johnson, for whom he had shewn much affection; while she ever had, and still retained, a great respect for him. Mrs. Knowles at the same time took an opportunity of letting him know &lsquo;that the amiable young creature was sorry at finding that he was offended at her leaving the Church of England and embracing a simpler faith;&rsquo; and, in the gentlest and most persuasive manner, solicited his kind indulgence for what was sincerely a matter of conscience. JOHNSON, (frowning very angrily,) &lsquo;Madam, she is an odious wench. She could not have any proper conviction that it was her duty to change her religion, which is the most important of all subjects, and should be studied with all care, and with all the helps we can get. She knew no more of the Church which she left, and that which she embraced, than she did of the difference between the Copernican and Ptolemaick systems.&rsquo; MRS. KNOWLES. &lsquo;She had the New Testament before her.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Madam, she could not understand the New Testament, the most difficult book in the world, for which the study of a life is required.&rsquo; MRS. KNOWLES. &lsquo;It is clear as to essentials.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;But not as to controversial points. The heathens were easily converted, because they had nothing to give up; but we ought not, without very strong conviction indeed, to desert the religion in which we have been educated. That is the religion given you, the religion in which it may be said Providence has placed you. If you live conscientiously in that religion, you may be safe. But errour is dangerous indeed, if you err when you choose a religion for yourself.&rsquo; MRS. KNOWLES. &lsquo;Must we then go by implicit faith?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Madam, the greatest part of our knowledge is implicit faith; and as to religion, have we heard all that a disciple of Confucius, all that a Mahometan, can say for himself?&rsquo; He then rose again into passion, and attacked the young proselyte in the severest terms of reproach, so that both the ladies seemed to be much shocked.</p>
<p class="p24">We remained together till it was pretty late. Notwithstanding occasional explosions of violence, we were all delighted upon the whole with Johnson. I compared him at this time to a warm West-Indian climate, where you have a bright sun, quick vegetation, luxuriant foliage, luscious fruits; but where the same heat sometimes produces thunder, lightning, earthquakes, in a terrible degree.</p>
<p class="p24">April 17, being Good Friday, I waited on Johnson, as usual. I observed at breakfast that although it was a part of his abstemious discipline on this most solemn fast, to take no milk in his tea, yet when Mrs. Desmoulins inadvertently poured it in, he did not reject it. I talked of the strange indecision of mind, and imbecility in the common occurrences of life, which we may observe in some people. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, I am in the habit of getting others to do things for me.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;What, Sir! have you that weakness?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Yes, Sir. But I always think afterwards I should have done better for myself.&rsquo; I told him that at a gentleman&rsquo;s house where there was thought to be such extravagance or bad management, that he was living much beyond his income, his lady had objected to the cutting of a pickled mango, and that I had taken an opportunity to ask the price of it, and found it was only two shillings; so here was a very poor saving. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, that is the blundering oeconomy of a narrow understanding. It is stopping one hole in a sieve.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I expressed some inclination to publish an account of my <span class="t8">Travels</span> upon the continent of Europe, for which I had a variety of materials collected. JOHNSON. &lsquo;I do not say, Sir, you may not publish your travels; but I give you my opinion, that you would lessen yourself by it. What can you tell of countries so well known as those upon the continent of Europe, which you have visited?&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;But I can give an entertaining narrative, with many incidents, anecdotes, <span class="t8">jeux d&rsquo;esprit</span>, and remarks, so as to make very pleasant reading.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, most modern travellers in Europe who have published their travels, have been laughed at: I would not have you added to the number. The world is now not contented to be merely entertained by a traveller&rsquo;s narrative; they want to learn something. Now some of my friends asked me, why I did not give some account of my travels in France. The reason is plain; intelligent readers had seen more of France than I had. <span class="t8">You</span> might have liked my travels in France, and THE CLUB might have liked them; but, upon the whole, there would have been more ridicule than good produced by them.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;I cannot agree with you, Sir. People would like to read what you say of any thing. Suppose a face has been painted by fifty painters before; still we love to see it done by Sir Joshua.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;True, Sir, but Sir Joshua cannot paint a face when he has not time to look on it.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Sir, a sketch of any sort by him is valuable. And, Sir, to talk to you in your own style (raising my voice, and shaking my head,) you <span class="t8">should</span> have given us your travels in France. I am <span class="t8">sure</span> I am right, and <span class="t8">there&rsquo;s an end on&rsquo;t</span>.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I said to him that it was certainly true, as my friend Dempster had observed in his letter to me upon the subject, that a great part of what was in his <span class="t8">Journey to the Western Islands of Scotland</span> had been in his mind before he left London. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why yes, Sir, the topicks were; and books of travels will be good in proportion to what a man has previously in his mind; his knowing what to observe; his power of contrasting one mode of life with another. As the Spanish proverb says, &ldquo;He, who would bring home the wealth of the Indies, must carry the wealth of the Indies with him.&rdquo; So it is in travelling; a man must carry knowledge with him, if he would bring home knowledge.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;The proverb, I suppose, Sir, means, he must carry a large stock with him to trade with.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Yes, Sir.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">It was a delightful day: as we walked to St. Clement&rsquo;s church, I again remarked that Fleet-street was the most cheerful scene in the world. &lsquo;Fleet-street (said I,) is in my mind more delightful than Tempé.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Ay, Sir; but let it be compared with Mull.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">There was a very numerous congregation to-day at St. Clement&rsquo;s church, which Dr. Johnson said he observed with pleasure.</p>
<p class="p24">And now I am to give a pretty full account of one of the most curious incidents in Johnson&rsquo;s life, of which he himself has made the following minute on this day: &lsquo;In my return from church, I was accosted by Edwards, an old fellow-collegian, who had not seen me since 1729. He knew me, and asked if I remembered one Edwards; I did not at first recollect the name, but gradually as we walked along, recovered it, and told him a conversation that had passed at an alehouse between us. My purpose is to continue our acquaintance.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">It was in Butcher-row that this meeting happened. Mr. Edwards, who was a decent-looking elderly man in grey clothes, and a wig of many curls, accosted Johnson with familiar confidence, knowing who he was, while Johnson returned his salutation with a courteous formality, as to a stranger. But as soon as Edwards had brought to his recollection their having been at Pembroke-College together nine-and-forty years ago, he seemed much pleased, asked where he lived, and said he should be glad to see him in Bolt-court. EDWARDS. &lsquo;Ah, Sir! we are old men now.&rsquo; JOHNSON, (who never liked to think of being old:) &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t let us discourage one another.&rsquo; EDWARDS. &lsquo;Why, Doctor, you look stout and hearty, I am happy to see you so; for the newspapers told us you were very ill.&rsquo; JOHNSON, &lsquo;Ay, Sir, they are always telling lies of <span class="t8">us old fellows</span>.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Wishing to be present at more of so singular a conversation as that between two fellow-collegians, who had lived forty years in London without ever having chanced to meet, I whispered to Mr. Edwards that Dr. Johnson was going home, and that he had better accompany him now. So Edwards walked along with us, I eagerly assisting to keep up the conversation. Mr. Edwards informed Dr. Johnson that he had practised long as a solicitor in Chancery, but that he now lived in the country upon a little farm, about sixty acres, just by Stevenage in Hertfordshire, and that he came to London (to Barnard&rsquo;s Inn, No. 6), generally twice a week. Johnson appearing to me in a reverie, Mr. Edwards addressed himself to me, and expatiated on the pleasure of living in the country. BOSWELL. &lsquo;I have no notion of this, Sir. What you have to entertain you, is, I think, exhausted in half an hour.&rsquo; EDWARDS. &lsquo;What? don&rsquo;t you love to have hope realized? I see my grass, and my corn, and my trees growing. Now, for instance, I am curious to see if this frost has not nipped my fruit-trees.&rsquo; JOHNSON, (who we did not imagine was attending:) &lsquo;You find, Sir, you have fears as well as hopes.&rsquo; &mdash; So well did he see the whole, when another saw but the half of a subject.</p>
<p class="p24">When we got to Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s house, and were seated in his library, the dialogue went on admirably. EDWARDS. &lsquo;Sir, I remember you would not let us say <span class="t8">prodigious</span> at College. For even then, Sir, (turning to me,) he was delicate in language, and we all feared him.&rsquo; JOHNSON, (to Edwards:) &lsquo;From your having practised the law long, Sir, I presume you must be rich.&rsquo; EDWARDS. &lsquo;No, Sir; I got a good deal of money; but I had a number of poor relations to whom I gave a great part of it.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, you have been rich in the most valuable sense of the word.&rsquo; EDWARDS. &lsquo;But I shall not die rich.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Nay, sure, Sir, it is better to <span class="t8">live</span> rich than to <span class="t8">die</span> rich.&rsquo; EDWARDS. &lsquo;I wish I had continued at College.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why do you wish that, Sir?&rsquo; EDWARDS. &lsquo;Because I think I should have had a much easier life than mine has been. I should have been a parson, and had a good living, like Bloxam and several others, and lived comfortably.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, the life of a parson, of a conscientious clergyman, is not easy. I have always considered a clergyman as the father of a larger family than he is able to maintain. I would rather have Chancery suits upon my hands than the cure of souls. No, Sir, I do not envy a clergyman&rsquo;s life as an easy life, nor do I envy the clergyman who makes it an easy life.&rsquo; Here taking himself up all of a sudden, he exclaimed, &lsquo;O! Mr. Edwards! I&rsquo;ll convince you that I recollect you. Do you remember our drinking together at an alehouse near Pembroke gate. At that time, you told me of the Eton boy, who, when verses on our Saviour&rsquo;s turning water into wine were prescribed as an exercise, brought up a single line, which was highly admired, &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&ldquo;<span class="t8">Vidit et erubuit lympha pudica Deum</span>,&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">and I told you of another fine line in Camden&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Remains</span>, an eulogy upon one of our Kings, who was succeeded by his son, a prince of equal merit: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&ldquo;<span class="t8">Mira cano, Sol occubuit, nox nulla secuta est</span>.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">EDWARDS. &lsquo;You are a philosopher, Dr. Johnson. I have tried too in my time to be a philosopher; but, I don&rsquo;t know how, cheerfulness was always breaking in.&rsquo; Mr. Burke, Sir Joshua Reynolds, Mr. Courtenay, Mr. Malone, and, indeed, all the eminent men to whom I have mentioned this, have thought it an exquisite trait of character. The truth is, that philosophy, like religion, is too generally supposed to be hard and severe, at least so grave as to exclude all gaiety.</p>
<p class="p24">EDWARDS. &lsquo;I have been twice married, Doctor. You, I suppose, have never known what it was to have a wife.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, I have known what it was to have a wife, and (in a solemn tender faultering tone) I have known what it was to <span class="t8">lose a wife</span>. &mdash; It had almost broke my heart.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">EDWARDS. &lsquo;How do you live, Sir? For my part, I must have my regular meals, and a glass of good wine. I find I require it.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;I now drink no wine, Sir. Early in life I drank wine: for many years I drank none. I then for some years drank a great deal.&rsquo; EDWARDS. &lsquo;Some hogsheads, I warrant you.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;I then had a severe illness, and left it off, and I have never begun it again. I never felt any difference upon myself from eating one thing rather than another, nor from one kind of weather rather than another. There are people. I believe, who feel a difference; but I am not one of them. And as to regular meals, I have fasted from the Sunday&rsquo;s dinner to the Tuesday&rsquo;s dinner, without any inconvenience. I believe it is best to eat just as one is hungry: but a man who is in business, or a man who has a family, must have stated meals. I am a straggler. I may leave this town and go to Grand Cairo, without being missed here or observed there.&rsquo; EDWARDS. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you eat supper, Sir?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;No, Sir.&rsquo; EDWARDS. &lsquo;For my part, now, I consider supper as a turnpike through which one must pass, in order to get to bed.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">JOHNSON. &lsquo;You are a lawyer, Mr. Edwards. Lawyers know life practically. A bookish man should always have them to converse with. They have what he wants.&rsquo; EDWARDS. &lsquo;I am grown old: I am sixty-five.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;I shall be sixty-eight next birth-day. Come, Sir, drink water, and put in for a hundred.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Mr. Edwards mentioned a gentleman who had left his whole fortune to Pembroke College. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Whether to leave one&rsquo;s whole fortune to a College be right, must depend upon circumstances. I would leave the interest of the fortune I bequeathed to a College to my relations or my friends, for their lives. It is the same thing to a College, which is a permanent society, whether it gets the money now or twenty years hence; and I would wish to make my relations or friends feel the benefit of it.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">This interview confirmed my opinion of Johnson&rsquo;s most humane and benevolent heart. His cordial and placid behaviour to an old fellow-collegian, a man so different from himself; and his telling him that he would go down to his farm and visit him, showed a kindness of disposition very rare at an advanced age. He observed, &lsquo;how wonderful it was that they had both been in London forty years, without having ever once met, and both walkers in the street too!&rsquo; Mr. Edwards, when going away, again recurred to his consciousness of senility, and looking full in Johnson&rsquo;s face, said to him, &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll find in Dr. Young,</p>
<p class="p24">&ldquo;O my coevals! remnants of yourselves!&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson did not relish this at all; but shook his head with impatience. Edwards walked off, seemingly highly pleased with the honour of having been thus noticed by Dr. Johnson. When he was gone, I said to Johnson, I thought him but a weak man. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, yes, Sir. Here is a man who has passed through life without experience: yet I would rather have him with me than a more sensible man who will not talk readily. This man is always willing to say what he has to say.&rsquo; Yet Dr. Johnson had himself by no means that willingness which he praised so much, and I think so justly; for who has not felt the painful effect of the dreary void, when there is a total silence in a company, for any length of time; or, which is as bad, or perhaps worse, when the conversation is with difficulty kept up by a perpetual effort?</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson once observed to me, &lsquo;Tom Tyers described me the best: &ldquo;Sir (said he), you are like a ghost: you never speak till you are spoken to.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">The gentleman whom he thus familiarly mentioned was Mr. Thomas Tyers, son of Mr. Jonathan Tyers, the founder of that excellent place of publick amusement, Vauxhall Gardens, which must ever be an estate to its proprietor, as it is peculiarly adapted to the taste of the English nation; there being a mixture of curious show, &mdash; gay exhibition, &mdash; musick, vocal and instrumental, not too refined for the general ear; &mdash; for all which only a shilling is paid; and, though last, not least, good eating and drinking for those who choose to purchase that regale. Mr. Thomas Tyers was bred to the law; but having a handsome fortune, vivacity of temper, and eccentricity of mind, he could not confine himself to the regularity of practice. He therefore ran about the world with a pleasant carelessness, amusing everybody by his desultory conversation. He abounded in anecdote, but was not sufficiently attentive to accuracy. I therefore cannot venture to avail myself much of a biographical sketch of Johnson which he published, being one among the various persons ambitious of appending their names to that of my illustrious friend. That sketch is, however, an entertaining little collection of fragments. Those which he published of Pope and Addison are of higher merit; but his fame must chiefly rest upon his <span class="t8">Political Conferences</span>, in which he introduces several eminent persons delivering their sentiments in the way of dialogue, and discovers a considerable share of learning, various knowledge, and discernment of character. This much may I be allowed to say of a man who was exceedingly obliging to me, and who lived with Dr. Johnson in as easy a manner as almost any of his very numerous acquaintance.</p>
<p class="p24">Mr. Edwards had said to me aside, that Dr. Johnson should have been of a profession. I repeated the remark to Johnson that I might have his own thoughts on the subject. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, it <span class="t8">would</span> have been better that I had been of a profession. I ought to have been a lawyer.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;I do not think, Sir, it would have been better, for we should not have had the <span class="t8">English Dictionary</span>.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;But you would have had <span class="t8">Reports</span>.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Ay; but there would not have been another, who could have written the <span class="t8">Dictionary</span>. There have been many very good Judges. Suppose you had been Lord Chancellor; you would have delivered opinions with more extent of mind, and in a more ornamented manner, than perhaps any Chancellor ever did, or ever will do. But, I believe, causes have been as judiciously decided as you could have done.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Yes, Sir. Property has been as well settled.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson, however, had a noble ambition floating in his mind, and had, undoubtedly, often speculated on the possibility of his supereminent powers being rewarded in this great and liberal country by the highest honours of the state. Sir William Scott informs me, that upon the death of the late Lord Lichfield, who was Chancellor of the University of Oxford, he said to Johnson, &lsquo;What a pity it is, Sir, that you did not follow the profession of the law. You might have been Lord Chancellor of Great Britain, and attained to the dignity of the peerage; and now that the title of Lichfield, your native city, is extinct, you might have had it.&rsquo; Johnson, upon this, seemed much agitated; and, in an angry tone, exclaimed, &lsquo;Why will you vex me by suggesting this, when it is too late?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">But he did not repine at the prosperity of others. The late Dr. Thomas Leland told Mr. Courtenay, that when Mr. Edmund Burke shewed Johnson his fine house and lands near Beaconsfield, Johnson coolly said, &lsquo;Non equidem invideo; miror magis.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Yet no man had a higher notion of the dignity of literature than Johnson, or was more determined in maintaining the respect which he justly considered as due to it. Of this, besides the general tenor of his conduct in society, some characteristical instances may be mentioned.</p>
<p class="p24">He told Sir Joshua Reynolds, that once when he dined in a numerous company of booksellers, where the room being small, the head of the table, at which he sat, was almost close to the fire, he persevered in suffering a great deal of inconvenience from the heat, rather than quit his place, and let one of them sit above him.</p>
<p class="p24">Goldsmith, in his diverting simplicity, complained one day, in a mixed company, of Lord Camden. &lsquo;I met him (said he) at Lord Clare&rsquo;s house in the country, and he took no more notice of me than if I had been an ordinary man.&rsquo; The company having laughed heartily, Johnson stood forth in defence of his friend. &lsquo;Nay, Gentleman, (said he,) Dr. Goldsmith is in the right. A nobleman ought to have made up to such a man as Goldsmith; and I think it is much against Lord Camden that he neglected him.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Nor could he patiently endure to hear that such respect as he thought due only to higher intellectual qualities, should be bestowed on men of slighter, though perhaps more amusing talents. I told him, that one morning, when I went to breakfast with Garrick, who was very vain of his intimacy with Lord Camden, he accosted me thus:&mdash; &lsquo;Pray now, did you &mdash; did you meet a little lawyer turning the corner, eh?&rsquo;&mdash; &lsquo;No, Sir, (said I.) Pray what do you mean by the question?&rsquo;&mdash; &lsquo;Why, (replied Garrick, with an affected indifference, yet as if standing on tip-toe,) Lord Camden has this moment left me. We have had a long walk together.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Well, Sir, Garrick talked very properly. Lord Camden <span class="t8">was a little lawyer</span> to be associating so familiarly with a player.&rsquo; Sir Joshua Reynolds observed, with great truth, that Johnson considered Garrick to be as it were his <span class="t8">property</span>. He would allow no man either to blame or to praise Garrick in his presence, without contradicting him.</p>
<p class="p24">Having fallen into a very serious frame of mind, in which mutual expressions of kindness passed between us, such as would be thought too vain in me to repeat, I talked with regret of the sad inevitable certainty that one of us must survive the other. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Yes, Sir, that is an affecting consideration. I remember Swift, in one of his letters to Pope, says, &ldquo;I intend to come over, that we may meet once more; and when we must part, it is what happens to all human beings.&rdquo;&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;The hope that we shall see our departed friends again must support the mind.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why yes, Sir.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;There is a strange unwillingness to part with life, independent of serious fears as to futurity. A reverend friend of ours (naming him) tells me, that he feels an uneasiness at the thoughts of leaving his house, his study, his books.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;This is foolish in &mdash;&mdash; . A man need not be uneasy on these grounds; for, as he will retain his consciousness, he may say with the philosopher, <span class="t8">Omnia mea mecum porto</span>.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;True, Sir: we may carry our books in our heads; but still there is something painful in the thought of leaving for ever what has given us pleasure. I remember, many years ago, when my imagination was warm, and I happened to be in a melancholy mood, it distressed me to think of going into a state of being in which Shakspeare&rsquo;s poetry did not exist. A lady whom I then much admired, a very amiable woman, humoured my fancy, and relieved me by saying, &ldquo;The first thing you will meet in the other world, will be an elegant copy of Shakspeare&rsquo;s works presented to you.&rdquo;&rsquo; Dr. Johnson smiled benignantly at this, and did not appear to disapprove of the notion.</p>
<p class="p24">We went to St. Clement&rsquo;s church again in the afternoon, and then returned and drank tea and coffee in Mrs. Williams&rsquo;s room; Mrs. Desmoulins doing the honours of the tea-table. I observed that he would not even look at a proof-sheet of his <span class="t8">Life of Waller</span> on Good-Friday.</p>
<p class="p24">Mr. Allen, the printer, brought a book on agriculture, which was printed, and was soon to be published. It was a very strange performance, the authour having mixed in it his own thoughts upon various topicks, along with his remarks on ploughing, sowing, and other farming operations. He seemed to be an absurd profane fellow, and had introduced in his book many sneers at religion, with equal ignorance and conceit. Dr. Johnson permitted me to read some passages aloud. One was, that he resolved to work on Sunday, and did work, but he owned he felt <span class="t8">some</span> weak compunction; and he had this very curious reflection:&mdash; &lsquo;I was born in the wilds of Christianity, and the briars and thorns still hang about me.&rsquo; Dr. Johnson could not help laughing at this ridiculous image, yet was very angry at the fellow&rsquo;s impiety. &lsquo;However, (said he,) the Reviewers will make him hang himself.&rsquo; He, however, observed, &lsquo;that formerly there might have been a dispensation obtained for working on Sunday in the time of harvest.&rsquo; Indeed in ritual observances, were all the ministers of religion what they should be, and what many of them are, such a power might be wisely and safely lodged with the Church.</p>
<p class="p24">On Saturday, April 14, I drank tea with him. He praised the late Mr. Buncombe, of Canterbury, as a pleasing man. &lsquo;He used to come to me: I did not seek much after him. Indeed I never sought much after any body.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Lord Orrery, I suppose.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;No, Sir; I never went to him but when he sent for me.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Richardson?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Yes, Sir. But I sought after George Psalmanazar the most. I used to go and sit with him at an alehouse in the city.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I am happy to mention another instance which I discovered of his <span class="t8">seeking after</span> a man of merit. Soon after the Honourable Daines Barrington had published his excellent <span class="t8">Observations on the Statutes</span>, Johnson waited on that worthy and learned gentleman; and, having told him his name, courteously said, &lsquo;I have read your book, Sir, with great pleasure, and wish to be better known to you.&rsquo; Thus began an acquaintance, which was continued with mutual regard as long as Johnson lived.</p>
<p class="p24">Talking of a recent seditious delinquent, he said, &lsquo;They should set him in the pillory, that he may be punished in a way that would disgrace him.&rsquo; I observed, that the pillory does not always disgrace. And I mentioned an instance of a gentleman who I thought was not dishonoured by it. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Ay, but he was, Sir. He could not mouth and strut as he used to do, after having been there. People are not willing to ask a man to their tables who has stood in the pillory.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">The Gentleman who had dined with us at Dr. Percy&rsquo;s came in. Johnson attacked the Americans with intemperate vehemence of abuse. I said something in their favour; and added, that I was always sorry when he talked on that subject. This, it seems, exasperated him; though he said nothing at the time. The cloud was charged with sulphureous vapour, which was afterwards to burst in thunder. &mdash; We talked of a gentleman who was running out his fortune in London; and I said, &lsquo;We must get him out of it. All his friends must quarrel with him, and that will soon drive him away.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Nay, Sir; we&rsquo;ll send <span class="t8">you</span> to him. If your company does not drive a man out of his house, nothing will.&rsquo; This was a horrible shock, for which there was no visible cause. I afterwards asked him why he had said so harsh a thing. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Because, Sir, you made me angry about the Americans.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;But why did you not take your revenge directly?&rsquo; JOHNSON. (smiling) &lsquo;Because, Sir, I had nothing ready. A man cannot strike till he has his weapons.&rsquo; This was a candid and pleasant confession.</p>
<p class="p24">He shewed me to-night his drawing-room, very genteelly fitted up; and said, &lsquo;Mrs. Thrale sneered when I talked of my having asked you and your lady to live at my house. I was obliged to tell her, that you would be in as respectable a situation in my house as in hers. Sir, the insolence of wealth will creep out.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;She has a little both of the insolence of wealth, and the conceit of parts.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;The insolence of wealth is a wretched thing; but the conceit of parts has some foundation. To be sure it should not be. But who is without it?&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Yourself, Sir.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why I play no tricks: I lay no traps.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;No, Sir. You are six feet high, and you only do not stoop.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">We talked of the numbers of people that sometimes have composed the household of great families. I mentioned that there were a hundred in the family of the present Earl of Eglintoune&rsquo;s father. Dr. Johnson seeming to doubt it, I began to enumerate. &lsquo;Let us see: my Lord and my Lady two.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Nay, Sir, if you are to count by twos, you may be long enough.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Well, but now I add two sons and seven daughters, and a servant for each, that will make twenty; so we have the fifth part already.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Very true. You get at twenty pretty readily; but you will not so easily get further on. We grow to five feet pretty readily; but it is not so easy to grow to seven.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Sunday, April 19, being Easter-day, after the solemnities of the festival in St. Paul&rsquo;s Church, I visited him, but could not stay to dinner. I expressed a wish to have the arguments for Christianity always in readiness, that my religious faith might be as firm and clear as any proposition whatever, so that I need not be under the least uneasiness, when it should be attacked. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, you cannot answer all objections. You have demonstration for a First Cause: you see he must be good as well as powerful, because there is nothing to make him otherwise, and goodness of itself is preferable. Yet you have against this, what is very certain, the unhappiness of human life. This, however, gives us reason to hope for a future state of compensation, that there may be a perfect system. But of that we were not sure, till we had a positive revelation.&rsquo; I told him, that his <span class="t8">Rasselas</span> had often made me unhappy; for it represented the misery of human life so well, and so convincingly to a thinking mind, that if at any time the impression wore off, and I felt myself easy, I began to suspect some delusion.</p>
<p class="p24">On Monday, April 20, I found him at home in the morning. We talked of a gentleman who we apprehended was gradually involving his circumstances by bad management. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Wasting a fortune is evaporation by a thousand imperceptible means. If it were a stream, they&rsquo;d stop it. You must speak to him. It is really miserable. Were he a gamester, it could be said he had hopes of winning. Were he a bankrupt in trade, he might have grown rich; but he has neither spirit to spend nor resolution to spare. He does not spend fast enough to have pleasure from it. He has the crime of prodigality, and the wretchedness of parsimony. If a man is killed in a duel, he is killed as many a one has been killed; but it is a sad thing for a man to lie down and die; to bleed to death, because he has not fortitude enough to sear the wound, or even to stitch it up.&rsquo; I cannot but pause a moment to admire the fecundity of fancy, and choice of language, which in this instance, and, indeed, on almost all occasions, he displayed. It was well observed by Dr. Percy, now Bishop of Dromore, &lsquo;The conversation of Johnson is strong and clear, and may be compared to an antique statue, where every vein and muscle is distinct and bold. Ordinary conversation resembles an inferiour cast.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Saturday, April 25, I dined with him at Sir Joshua Reynolds&rsquo;s, with the learned Dr. Musgrave, Counsellor Leland of Ireland, son to the historian, Mrs. Cholmondeley, and some more ladies. <span class="t8">The Project</span>, a new poem, was read to the company by Dr. Musgrave. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, it has no power. Were it not for the well-known names with which it is filled, it would be nothing: the names carry the poet, not the poet the names.&rsquo; MUSGRAVE. &lsquo;A temporary poem always entertains us.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;So does an account of the criminals hanged yesterday entertain us.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He proceeded:&mdash; &lsquo;Demosthenes Taylor, as he was called, (that is, the Editor of Demosthenes) was the most silent man, the merest statue of a man that I have ever seen. I once dined in company with him, and all he said during the whole time was no more than <span class="t8">Richard</span>. How a man should say only Richard, it is not easy to imagine. But it was thus: Dr. Douglas was talking of Dr. Zachary Grey, and ascribing to him something that was written by Dr. Richard Grey. So, to correct him, Taylor said, (imitating his affected sententious emphasis and nod,) &ldquo;<span class="t8">Richard</span>.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Mrs. Cholmondeley, in a high flow of spirits, exhibited some lively sallies of hyperbolical compliment to Johnson, with whom she had been long acquainted, and was very easy. He was quick in catching the <span class="t8">manner</span> of the moment, and answered her somewhat in the style of the hero of a romance, &lsquo;Madam, you crown me with unfading laurels.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I happened, I know not how, to say that a pamphlet meant a prose piece. JOHNSON. &lsquo;No, Sir. A few sheets of poetry unbound are a pamphlet, as much as a few sheets of prose.&rsquo; MUSGRAVE. &lsquo;A pamphlet may be understood to mean a poetical piece in Westminster-Hall, that is, in formal language; but in common language it is understood to mean prose.&rsquo; JOHNSON. (and here was one of the many instances of his knowing clearly and telling exactly how a thing is) &lsquo;A pamphlet is understood in common language to mean prose, only from this, that there is so much more prose written than poetry; as when we say a <span class="t8">book</span>, prose is understood for the same reason, though a book may as well be in poetry as in prose. We understand what is most general, and we name what is less frequent.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">We talked of a lady&rsquo;s verses on Ireland. MISS REYNOLDS. &lsquo;Have you seen them, Sir?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;No, Madam. I have seen a translation from Horace, by one of her daughters. She shewed it me.&rsquo; MISS REYNOLDS. &lsquo;And how was it, Sir?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, very well for a young Miss&rsquo;s verses; &mdash; that is to say, compared with excellence, nothing; but, very well, for the person who wrote them. I am vexed at being shewn verses in that manner.&rsquo; MISS REYNOLDS. &lsquo;But if they should be good, why not give them hearty praise?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Madam, because I have not then got the better of my bad humour from having been shewn them. You must consider, Madam; beforehand they may be bad, as well as good. Nobody has a right to put another under such a difficulty, that he must either hurt the person by telling the truth, or hurt himself by telling what is not true.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;A man often shews his writings to people of eminence, to obtain from them, either from their good-nature, or from their not being able to tell the truth firmly, a commendation, of which he may afterwards avail himself.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Very true, Sir. Therefore the man, who is asked by an authour, what he thinks of his work, is put to the torture, and is not obliged to speak the truth; so that what he says is not considered as his opinion; yet he has said it, and cannot retract it; and this authour, when mankind are hunting him with a cannister at his tail, can say, &ldquo;I would not have published, had not Johnson, or Reynolds, or Musgrave, or some other good judge commended the work.&rdquo; Yet I consider it as a very difficult question in conscience, whether one should advise a man not to publish a work, if profit be his object; for the man may say, &ldquo;Had it not been for you, I should have had the money.&rdquo; Now you cannot be sure; for you have only your own opinion, and the publick may think very differently.&rsquo; SIR JOSHUA REYNOLDS. &lsquo;You must upon such an occasion have two judgments; one as to the real value of the work, the other as to what may please the general taste at the time.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;But you can be sure of neither; and therefore I should scruple much to give a suppressive vote. Both Goldsmith&rsquo;s comedies were once refused; his first by Garrick, his second by Colman, who was prevailed on at last by much solicitation, nay, a kind of force, to bring it on. His <span class="t8">Vicar of Wakefield</span> I myself did not think would have had much success. It was written and sold to a bookseller before his <span class="t8">Traveller</span>; but published after; so little expectation had the bookseller from it. Had it been sold after the <span class="t8">Traveller</span>, he might have had twice as much money for it, though sixty guineas was no mean price. The bookseller had the advantage of Goldsmith&rsquo;s reputation from <span class="t8">The Traveller</span> in the sale, though Goldsmith had it not in selling the copy.&rsquo; SIR JOSHUA REYNOLDS. &lsquo;<span class="t8">The Beggar&rsquo;s Opera</span> affords a proof how strangely people will differ in opinion about a literary performance. Burke thinks it has no merit.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;It was refused by one of the houses; but I should have thought it would succeed, not from any great excellence in the writing, but from the novelty, and the general spirit and gaiety of the piece, which keeps the audience always attentive, and dismisses them in good humour.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">We went to the drawing-room, where was a considerable increase of company. Several of us got round Dr. Johnson, and complained that he would not give us an exact catalogue of his works, that there might be a complete edition. He smiled, and evaded our entreaties. That he intended to do it, I have no doubt, because I have heard him say so; and I have in my possession an imperfect list, fairly written out, which he entitles <span class="t8">Historia Studiorum</span>. I once got from one of his friends a list, which there was pretty good reason to suppose was accurate, for it was written down in his presence by this friend, who enumerated each article aloud, and had some of them mentioned to him by Mr. Levett, in concert with whom it was made out; and Johnson, who heard all this, did not contradict it. But when I shewed a copy of this list to him, and mentioned the evidence for its exactness, he laughed, and said, &lsquo;I was willing to let them go on as they pleased, and never interfered.&rsquo; Upon which I read it to him, article by article, and got him positively to own or refuse; and then, having obtained certainty so far, I got some other articles confirmed by him directly; and afterwards, from time to time, made additions under his sanction.</p>
<p class="p24">His friend Edward Cave having been mentioned, he told us, &lsquo;Cave used to sell ten thousand of <span class="t8">The Gentleman&rsquo;s Magazine</span>; yet such was then his minute attention and anxiety that the sale should not suffer the smallest decrease, that he would name a particular person who he heard had talked of leaving off the <span class="t8">Magazine</span>, and would say, &lsquo;Let us have something good next month.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">It was observed, that avarice was inherent in some dispositions. JOHNSON. &lsquo;No man was born a miser, because no man was born to possession. Every man is born <span class="t8">cupidus</span> &mdash; desirous of getting; but not <span class="t8">avarus</span>, &mdash; desirous of keeping.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;I have heard old Mr. Sheridan maintain, with much ingenuity, that a complete miser is a happy man; a miser who gives himself wholly to the one passion of saving.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;That is flying in the face of all the world, who have called an avaricious man a <span class="t8">miser</span>, because he is miserable. No, Sir; a man who both spends and saves money is the happiest man, because he has both enjoyments.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">The conversation having turned on <span class="t8">Bon-Mots</span>, he quoted, from one of the <span class="t8">Ana</span>, an exquisite instance of flattery in a maid of honour in France, who being asked by the Queen what o&rsquo;clock it was, answered, &lsquo;What your Majesty pleases.&rsquo; He admitted that Mr. Burke&rsquo;s classical pun upon Mr. Wilkes&rsquo;s being carried on the shoulders of the mob, &mdash; </p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;… Numerisque fertur<br/>Lege solutus,&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">was admirable; and though he was strangely unwilling to allow to that extraordinary man the talent of wit, he also laughed with approbation at another of his playful conceits; which was, that &lsquo;Horace has in one line given a description of a good desirable manour: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&ldquo;Est modus in rebus, sunt certi denique fines;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">that is to say, a <span class="t8">modus</span> as to the tithes and certain <span class="t8">fines</span>.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He observed, &lsquo;A man cannot with propriety speak of himself, except he relates simple facts; as, &ldquo;I was at Richmond:&rdquo; or what depends on mensuration; as, &ldquo;I am six feet high.&rdquo; He is sure he has been at Richmond; he is sure he is six feet high: but he cannot be sure he is wise, or that he has any other excellence. Then, all censure of a man&rsquo;s self is oblique praise. It is in order to shew how much he can spare. It has all the invidiousness of self-praise, and all the reproach of falsehood.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Sometimes it may proceed from a man&rsquo;s strong consciousness of his faults being observed. He knows that others would throw him down, and therefore he had better lye down softly of his own accord.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Tuesday, April 28, he was engaged to dine at General Paoli&rsquo;s, where, as I have already observed, I was still entertained in elegant hospitality, and with all the ease and comfort of a home. I called on him, and accompanied him in a hackney-coach. We stopped first at the bottom of Hedge-lane, into which he went to leave a letter, &lsquo;with good news for a poor man in distress,&rsquo; as he told me. I did not question him particularly as to this. He himself often resembled Lady Bolingbroke&rsquo;s lively description of Pope; that &lsquo;he was <span class="t8">un politique aux choux et aux raves</span>.&rsquo;.&rsquo; He would say, &lsquo;I dine to-day in Grosvenor-square;&rsquo; this might be with a Duke: or, perhaps, &lsquo;I dine to-day at the other end of the town:&rsquo; or, &lsquo;A gentleman of great eminence called on me yesterday.&rsquo; He loved thus to keep things floating in conjecture: <span class="t8">Omne ignotum pro magnifico est</span>.. I believe I ventured to dissipate the cloud, to unveil the mystery, more freely and frequently than any of his friends. We stopped again at Wirgman&rsquo;s, the well-known <span class="t8">toy-shop</span>, in St. James&rsquo;s-street, at the corner of St. James&rsquo;s-place, to which he had been directed, but not clearly, for he searched about some time, and could not find it at first; and said, &lsquo;To direct one only to a corner shop is <span class="t8">toying</span> with one.&rsquo; I suppose he meant this as a play upon the word <span class="t8">toy</span>: it was the first time that I knew him stoop to such sport. After he had been some time in the shop, he sent for me to come out of the coach, and help him to choose a pair of silver buckles, as those he had were too small. Probably this alteration in dress had been suggested by Mrs. Thrale, by associating with whom, his external appearance was much improved. He got better cloaths; and the dark colour, from which he never deviated, was enlivened by metal buttons. His wigs, too, were much better; and during their travels in France, he was furnished with a Paris-made wig, of handsome construction. This choosing of silver buckles was a negociation: &lsquo;Sir (said he), I will not have the ridiculous large ones now in fashion; and I will give no more than a guinea for a pair.&rsquo; Such were the <span class="t8">principles</span> of the business; and, after some examination, he was fitted. As we drove along, I found him in a talking humour, of which I availed myself. BOSWELL. &lsquo;I was this morning in Ridley&rsquo;s shop, Sir; and was told, that the collection called <span class="t8">Johnsoniana</span> has sold very much.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Yet the <span class="t8">Journey to the Hebrides</span> has not had a great sale.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;That is strange.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Yes, Sir; for in that book I have told the world a great deal that they did not know before.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">BOSWELL. &lsquo;I drank chocolate, Sir, this morning with Mr. Eld; and, to my no small surprize, found him to be a <span class="t8">Staffordshire Whig</span>, a being which I did not believe had existed.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, there are rascals in all countries.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Eld said, a Tory was a creature generated between a non-juring parson and one&rsquo;s grandmother.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;And I have always said, the first Whig was the Devil.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;He certainly was, Sir. The Devil was impatient of subordination; he was the first who resisted power: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&ldquo;Better to reign in Hell, than serve in Heaven.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">At General Paoli&rsquo;s were Sir Joshua Reynolds, Mr. Langton, Marchese Gherardi of Lombardy, and Mr. John Spottiswoode the younger, of Spottiswoode, the solicitor. At this time fears of an invasion were circulated; to obviate which, Mr. Spottiswoode observed, that Mr. Fraser the engineer, who had lately come from Dunkirk, said, that the French had the same fears of us. JOHNSON. &lsquo;It is thus that mutual cowardice keeps us in peace. Were one half of mankind brave, and one half cowards, the brave would be always beating the cowards. Were all brave, they would lead a very uneasy life; all would be continually fighting: but being all cowards, we go on very well.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">We talked of drinking wine. JOHNSON. &lsquo;I require wine, only when I am alone. I have then often wished for it, and often taken it.&rsquo; SPOTTISWOODE. &lsquo;What, by way of a companion, Sir?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;To get rid of myself, to send myself away. Wine gives great pleasure; and every pleasure is of itself a good. It is a good, unless counterbalanced by evil. A man may have a strong reason not to drink wine; and that may be greater than the pleasure. Wine makes a man better pleased with himself. I do not say that it makes him more pleasing to others. Sometimes it does. But the danger is, that while a man grows better pleased with himself, he may be growing less pleasing to others. Wine gives a man nothing. It neither gives him knowledge nor wit; it only animates a man, and enables him to bring out what a dread of the company has repressed. It only puts in motion what has been locked up in frost. But this may be good, or it may be bad.&rsquo; SPOTTISWOODE. &lsquo;So, Sir, wine is a key which opens a box; but this box may be either full or empty.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Nay, Sir, conversation is the key: wine is a pick-lock, which forces open the box and injures it. A man should cultivate his mind so as to have that confidence and readiness without wine, which wine gives.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;The great difficulty of resisting wine is from benevolence. For instance, a good worthy man asks you to taste his wine, which he has had twenty years in his cellar.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, all this notion about benevolence arises from a man&rsquo;s imagining himself to be of more importance to others, than he really is. They don&rsquo;t care a farthing whether he drinks wine or not.&rsquo; SIR JOSHUA REYNOLDS. &lsquo;Yes, they do for the time.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;For the time! &mdash; If they care this minute, they forget it the next. And as for the good worthy man; how do you know he is good and worthy? No good and worthy man will insist upon another man&rsquo;s drinking wine. As to the wine twenty years in the cellar, &mdash; of ten men, three say this, merely because they must say something; &mdash; three are telling a lie, when they say they have had the wine twenty years; &mdash; three would rather save the wine; &mdash; one, perhaps, cares. I allow it is something to please one&rsquo;s company: and people are always pleased with those who partake pleasure with them. But after a man has brought himself to relinquish the great personal pleasure which arises from drinking wine, any other consideration is a trifle. To please others by drinking wine, is something only, if there be nothing against it. I should, however, be sorry to offend worthy men: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p26">&ldquo;Curst be the verse, how well so e&rsquo;er it flow,<br/>That tends to make one worthy man my foe.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">BOSWELL. &lsquo;Curst be the <span class="t8">spring</span>, the <span class="t8">water</span>.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;But let us consider what a sad thing it would be, if we were obliged to drink or do any thing else that may happen to be agreeable to the company where we are.&rsquo; LANGTON. &lsquo;By the same rule you must join with a gang of cut-purses.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Yes, Sir: but yet we must do justice to wine; we must allow it the power it possesses. To make a man pleased with himself, let me tell you, is doing a very great thing;</p>
<p class="p24">&ldquo;<span class="t8">Si patriæ volumus, si</span> Nobis <span class="t8">vivere cari</span>.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I was at this time myself a water-drinker, upon trial, by Johnson&rsquo;s recommendation. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Boswell is a bolder combatant than Sir Joshua: he argues for wine without the help of wine; but Sir Joshua with it.&rsquo; SIR JOSHUA REYNOLDS. &lsquo;But to please one&rsquo;s company is a strong motive.&rsquo; JOHNSON. (who, from drinking only water, supposed every body who drank wine to be elevated,) &lsquo;I won&rsquo;t argue any more with you, Sir. You are too far gone.&rsquo; SIR JOSHUA. &lsquo;I should have thought so indeed, Sir, had I made such a speech as you have now done.&rsquo; JOHNSON (drawing himself in, and, I really thought blushing,) &lsquo;Nay, don&rsquo;t be angry. I did not mean to offend you.&rsquo; SIR JOSHUA. &lsquo;At first the taste of wine was disagreeable to me; but I brought myself to drink it, that I might be like other people. The pleasure of drinking wine is so connected with pleasing your company, that altogether there is something of social goodness in it.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, this is only saying the same thing over again.&rsquo; SIR JOSHUA. &lsquo;No, this is new.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;You put it in new words, but it is an old thought. This is one of the disadvantages of wine. It makes a man mistake words for thoughts.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;I think it is a new thought; at least, it is in a new <span class="t8">attitude</span>.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Nay, Sir, it is only in a new coat; or an old coat with a new facing. (Then laughing heartily) It is the old dog in a new doublet. &mdash; An extraordinary instance however may occur where a man&rsquo;s patron will do nothing for him, unless he will drink: <span class="t8">there</span> may be a good reason for drinking.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I mentioned a nobleman, who I believed was really uneasy if his company would not drink hard. JOHNSON. &lsquo;That is from having had people about him whom he has been accustomed to command.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Supposing I should be <span class="t8">tête-à-tête</span> with him at table.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, there is no more reason for your drinking with <span class="t8">him</span>, than his being sober with <span class="t8">you</span>.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Why that is true; for it would do him less hurt to be sober, than it would do me to get drunk.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Yes, Sir; and from what I have heard of him, one would not wish to sacrifice himself to such a man. If he must always have somebody to drink with him, he should buy a slave, and then he would be sure to have it. They who submit to drink as another pleases, make themselves his slaves.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;But, Sir, you will surely make allowance for the duty of hospitality. A gentleman who loves drinking, comes to visit me.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, a man knows whom he visits; he comes to the table of a sober man.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;But, Sir, you and I should not have been so well received in the Highlands and Hebrides, if I had not drunk with our worthy friends. Had I drunk water only as you did, they would not have been so cordial.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir William Temple mentions that in his travels through the Netherlands he had two or three gentlemen with him; and when a bumper was necessary, he put it on <span class="t8">them</span>. Were I to travel again through the islands, I would have Sir Joshua with me to take the bumpers.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;But, Sir, let me put a case. Suppose Sir Joshua should take a jaunt into Scotland; he does me the honour to pay me a visit at my house in the country; I am overjoyed at seeing him; we are quite by ourselves, shall I unsociably and churlishly let him sit drinking by himself? No, no, my dear Sir Joshua, you shall not be treated so, I <span class="t8">will</span> take a bottle with you.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">The celebrated Mrs. Rudd being mentioned. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Fifteen years ago I should have gone to see her.&rsquo; SPOTTISWOODE. &lsquo;Because she was fifteen years younger?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;No, Sir; but now they have a trick of putting every thing into the newspapers.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He begged of General Paoli to repeat one of the introductory stanzas of the first book of Tasso&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Jerusalem</span>, which he did, and then Johnson found fault with the simile of sweetening the edges of a cup for a child, being transferred from Lucretius into an epick poem. The General said he did not imagine Homer&rsquo;s poetry was so ancient as is supposed, because he ascribes to a Greek colony circumstances of refinement not found in Greece itself at a later period, when Thucydides wrote. JOHNSON. &lsquo;I recollect but one passage quoted by Thucydides from Homer, which is not to be found in our copies of Homer&rsquo;s works; I am for the antiquity of Homer, and think that a Grecian colony, by being nearer Persia, might be more refined than the mother country.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Wednesday, April 29, I dined with him at Mr. Allan Ramsay&rsquo;s, where were Lord Binning, Dr. Robertson the historian, Sir Joshua Reynolds, and the Honourable Mrs. Boscawen, widow of the Admiral, and mother of the present Viscount Falmouth; of whom, if it be not presumptuous in me to praise her, I would say, that her manners are the most agreeable, and her conversation the best, of any lady with whom I ever had the happiness to be acquainted. Before Johnson came we talked a good deal of him; Ramsay said he had always found him a very polite man, and that he treated him with great respect, which he did very sincerely. I said I worshipped him. ROBERTSON. &lsquo;But some of you spoil him; you should not worship him; you should worship no man.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;I cannot help worshipping him, he is so much superiour to other men.&rsquo; ROBERTSON. &lsquo;In criticism, and in wit in conversation, he is no doubt very excellent; but in other respects he is not above other men; he will believe any thing, and will strenuously defend the most minute circumstance connected with the Church of England.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Believe me, Doctor, you are much mistaken as to this; for when you talk with him calmly in private, he is very liberal in his way of thinking.&rsquo; ROBERTSON. &lsquo;He and I have been always very gracious; the first time I met him was one evening at Strahan&rsquo;s, when he had just had an unlucky altercation with Adam Smith, to whom he had been so rough, that Strahan, after Smith was gone, had remonstrated with him, and told him that I was coming soon, and that he was uneasy to think that he might behave in the same manner to me. &ldquo;No, no, Sir, (said Johnson) I warrant you Robertson and I shall do very well.&rdquo; Accordingly he was gentle and good-humoured, and courteous with me the whole evening; and he has been so upon every occasion that we have met since. I have often said (laughing) that I have been in a great measure indebted to Smith for my good reception.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;His power of reasoning is very strong, and he has a peculiar art of drawing characters, which is as rare as good portrait painting.&rsquo; SIR JOSHUA REYNOLDS. &lsquo;He is undoubtedly admirable in this; but, in order to mark the characters which he draws, he overcharges them, and gives people more than they really have, whether of good or bad.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">No sooner did he, of whom we had been thus talking so easily, arrive, than we were all as quiet as a school upon the entrance of the head-master; and were very soon set down to a table covered with such variety of good things, as contributed not a little to dispose him to be pleased.</p>
<p class="p24">RAMSAY. &lsquo;I am old enough to have been a contemporary of Pope. His poetry was highly admired in his life-time, more a great deal than after his death.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, it has not been less admired since his death; no authours ever had so much fame in their own life-time as Pope and Voltaire; and Pope&rsquo;s poetry has been as much admired since his death as during his life; it has only not been as much talked of, but that is owing to its being now more distant, and people having other writings to talk of. Virgil is less talked of than Pope, and Homer is less talked of than Virgil; but they are not less admired. We must read what the world reads at the moment. It has been maintained that this superfoetation, this teeming of the press in modern times, is prejudicial to good literature, because it obliges us to read so much of what is of inferiour value, in order to be in the fashion; so that better works are neglected for want of time, because a man will have more gratification of his vanity in conversation, from having read modern books, than from having read the best works of antiquity. But it must be considered, that we have now more knowledge generally diffused; all our ladies read now, which is a great extension. Modern writers are the moons of literature; they shine with reflected light, with light borrowed from the ancients. Greece appears to me to be the fountain of knowledge; Rome of elegance.&rsquo; RAMSAY. &lsquo;I suppose Homer&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Iliad</span> to be a collection of pieces which had been written before his time. I should like to see a translation of it in poetical prose like the book of Ruth or Job.&rsquo; ROBERTSON. &lsquo;Would you, Dr. Johnson, who are master of the English language, but try your hand upon a part of it.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, you could not read it without the pleasure of verse.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">We talked of antiquarian researches. JOHNSON. &lsquo;All that is really <span class="t8">known</span> of the ancient state of Britain is contained in a few pages. We <span class="t8">can</span> know no more than what the old writers have told us; yet what large books have we upon it, the whole of which, excepting such parts as are taken from those old writers, is all a dream, such as Whitaker&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Manchester</span>. I have heard Henry&rsquo;s <span class="t8">History of Britain</span> well spoken of: I am told it is carried on in separate divisions, as the civil, the military, the religious history: I wish much to have one branch well done, and that is the history of manners, of common life.&rsquo; ROBERTSON. &lsquo;Henry should have applied his attention to that alone, which is enough for any man; and he might have found a great deal scattered in various books, had he read solely with that view. Henry erred in not selling his first volume at a moderate price to the booksellers, that they might have pushed him on till he had got reputation. I sold my <span class="t8">History of Scotland</span> at a moderate price, as a work by which the booksellers might either gain or not; and Cadell has told me that Millar and he have got six thousand pounds by it. I afterwards received a much higher price for my writings. An authour should sell his first work for what the booksellers will give, till it shall appear whether he is an authour of merit, or, which is the same thing as to purchase-money, an authour who pleases the publick.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Dr. Robertson expatiated on the character of a certain nobleman; that he was one of the strongest-minded men that ever lived; that he would sit in company quite sluggish, while there was nothing to call forth his intellectual vigour; but the moment that any important subject was started, for instance, how this country is to be defended against a French invasion, he would rouse himself, and shew his extraordinary talents with the most powerful ability and animation. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Yet this man cut his own throat. The true strong and sound mind is the mind that can embrace equally great things and small. Now I am told the King of Prussia will say to a servant, &ldquo;Bring me a bottle of such a wine, which came in such a year; it lies in such a corner of the cellars.&rdquo; I would have a man great in great things, and elegant in little things.&rsquo; He said to me afterwards, when we were by ourselves, &lsquo;Robertson was in a mighty romantick humour, he talked of one whom he did not know; but I <span class="t8">downed</span> him with the King of Prussia.&rsquo; &lsquo;Yes, Sir, (said I,) you threw a <span class="t8">bottle</span> at his head.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">An ingenious gentleman was mentioned, concerning whom both Robertson and Ramsay agreed that he had a constant firmness of mind; for after a laborious day, and amidst a multiplicity of cares and anxieties, he would sit down with his sisters and be quite cheerful and good-humoured. Such a disposition, it was observed, was a happy gift of nature. JOHNSON. &lsquo;I do not think so; a man has from nature a certain portion of mind; the use he makes of it depends upon his own free will. That a man has always the same firmness of mind I do not say; because every man feels his mind less firm at one time than another; but I think a man&rsquo;s being in a good or bad humour depends upon his will.&rsquo; I, however, could not help thinking that a man&rsquo;s humour is often uncontroulable by his will.</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson harangued against drinking wine. &lsquo;A man (said he) may choose whether he will have abstemiousness and knowledge, or claret and ignorance.&rsquo; Dr. Robertson, (who is very companionable,) was beginning to dissent as to the proscription of claret. JOHNSON: (with a placid smile.) &lsquo;Nay, Sir, you shall not differ with me; as I have said that the man is most perfect who takes in the most things, I am for knowledge and claret.&rsquo; ROBERTSON: (holding a glass of generous claret in his hand.) &lsquo;Sir, I can only drink your health.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, I should be sorry if <span class="t8">you</span> should be ever in such a state as to be able to do nothing more.&rsquo; ROBERTSON. &lsquo;Dr. Johnson, allow me to say, that in one respect I have the advantage of you; when you were in Scotland you would not come to hear any of our preachers, whereas, when I am here, I attend your publick worship without scruple, and indeed, with great satisfaction.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, that is not so extraordinary: the King of Siam sent ambassadors to Louis the Fourteenth; but Louis the Fourteenth sent none to the King of Siam.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Here my friend for once discovered a want of knowledge or forgetfulness; for Louis the Fourteenth did send an embassy to the King of Siam, and the Abbé Choisi, who was employed in it, published an account of it in two volumes.</p>
<p class="p24">Next day, Thursday, April 30, I found him at home by himself. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Well, Sir, Ramsay gave us a splendid dinner. I love Ramsay. You will not find a man in whose conversation there is more instruction, more information, and more elegance, than in Ramsay&rsquo;s.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;What I admire in Ramsay, is his continuing to be so young.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, yes, Sir, it is to be admired. I value myself upon this, that there is nothing of the old man in my conversation. I am now sixty-eight, and I have no more of it than at twenty-eight.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;But, Sir, would not you wish to know old age? He who is never an old man, does not know the whole of human life; for old age is one of the divisions of it.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Nay, Sir, what talk is this?&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;I mean, Sir, the Sphinx&rsquo;s description of it; &mdash; morning, noon, and night. I would know night, as well as morning and noon.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;What, Sir, would you know what it is to feel the evils of old age? Would you have the gout? Would you have decrepitude?&rsquo; &mdash; Seeing him heated, I would not argue any farther; but I was confident that I was in the right. I would, in due time, be a Nestor, an elder of the people; and there <span class="t8">should</span> be some difference between the conversation of twenty-eight and sixty-eight. A grave picture should not be gay. There is a serene, solemn, placid old age. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Mrs. Thrale&rsquo;s mother said of me what flattered me much. A clergyman was complaining of want of society in the country where he lived; and said, &ldquo;They talk of <span class="t8">runts</span>;&rdquo; (that is, young cows). &ldquo;Sir, (said Mrs. Salusbury,) Mr. Johnson would learn to talk of runts:&rdquo; meaning that I was a man who would make the most of my situation, whatever it was.&rsquo; He added, &lsquo;I think myself a very polite man.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Saturday, May 2, I dined with him at Sir Joshua Reynolds&rsquo;s, where there was a very large company, and a great deal of conversation; but owing to some circumstance which I cannot now recollect, I have no record of any part of it, except that there were several people there by no means of the Johnsonian school; so that less attention was paid to him than usual, which put him out of humour; and upon some imaginary offence from me, he attacked me with such rudeness, that I was vexed and angry, because it gave those persons an opportunity of enlarging upon his supposed ferocity, and ill treatment of his best friends. I was so much hurt, and had my pride so much roused, that I kept away from him for a week; and, perhaps, might have kept away much longer, nay, gone to Scotland without seeing him again, had not we fortunately met and been reconciled. To such unhappy chances are human friendships liable.</p>
<p class="p24">On Friday, May 8, I dined with him at Mr. Langton&rsquo;s. I was reserved and silent, which I suppose he perceived, and might recollect the cause. After dinner when Mr. Langton was called out of the room, and we were by ourselves, he drew his chair near to mine, and said, in a tone of conciliating courtesy, &lsquo;Well, how have you done?&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Sir, you have made me very uneasy by your behaviour to me when we were last at Sir Joshua Reynolds&rsquo;s. You know, my dear Sir, no man has a greater respect and affection for you, or would sooner go to the end of the world to serve you. Now to treat me so &mdash; .&rsquo; He insisted that I had interrupted him, which I assured him was not the case; and proceeded&mdash; &lsquo;But why treat me so before people who neither love you nor me?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Well, I am sorry for it. I&rsquo;ll make it up to you twenty different ways, as you please.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;I said to-day to Sir Joshua, when he observed that you <span class="t8">tossed</span> me sometimes &mdash; I don&rsquo;t care how often, or how high he tosses me, when only friends are present, for then I fall upon soft ground: but I do not like falling on stones, which is the case when enemies are present. &mdash; I think this a pretty good image, Sir.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, it is one of the happiest I have ever heard.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">The truth is, there was no venom in the wounds which he inflicted at any time, unless they were irritated by some malignant infusion by other hands. We were instantly as cordial again as ever, and joined in hearty laugh at some ludicrous but innocent peculiarities of one of our friends. BOSWELL. &lsquo;Do you think, Sir, it is always culpable to laugh at a man to his face?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, that depends upon the man and the thing. If it is a slight man, and a slight thing, you may; for you take nothing valuable from him.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He said, &lsquo;I read yesterday Dr. Blair&rsquo;s sermon on Devotion, from the text &ldquo;<span class="t8">Cornelius, a devout man</span>.&rdquo; His doctrine is the best limited, the best expressed: there is the most warmth without fanaticism, the most rational transport. There is one part of it which I disapprove, and I&rsquo;d have him correct it; which is, that &ldquo;he who does not feel joy in religion is far from the kingdom of heaven!&rdquo; There are many good men whose fear of GOD predominates over their love. It may discourage. It was rashly said. A noble sermon it is indeed. I wish Blair would come over to the Church of England.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">When Mr. Langton returned to us, the &lsquo;flow of talk&rsquo; went on. An eminent author being mentioned; &mdash; JOHNSON. &lsquo;He is not a pleasant man. His conversation is neither instructive nor brilliant. He does not talk as if impelled by any fulness of knowledge or vivacity of imagination. His conversation is like that of any other sensible man. He talks with no wish either to inform or to hear, but only because he thinks it does not become &mdash;&mdash; to sit in a company and say nothing.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Mr. Langton having repeated the anecdote of Addison having distinguished between his powers in conversation and in writing, by saying &lsquo;I have only nine-pence in my pocket; but I can draw for a thousand pounds;&rsquo; &mdash; JOHNSON. &lsquo;He had not that retort ready, Sir; he had prepared it before-hand.&rsquo; LANGTON: (turning to me.) &lsquo;A fine surmise. Set a thief to catch a thief.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson called the East-Indians barbarians. BOSWELL. &lsquo;You will except the Chinese, Sir?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;No, Sir.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Have they not arts?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;They have pottery.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;What do you say to the written characters of their language? &lsquo;JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, they have not an alphabet. They have not been able to form what all other nations have formed.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;There is more learning in their language than in any other, from the immense number of their characters.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;It is only more difficult from its rudeness; as there is more labour in hewing down a tree with a stone than with an axe.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He said, &lsquo;I have been reading Lord Kames&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Sketches of the History of Man</span>. In treating of severity of punishment, he mentions that of Madame Lapouchin, in Russia, but he does not give it fairly; for I have looked at <span class="t8">Chappe D&rsquo;Auteroche</span>, from whom he has taken it. He stops where it is said that the spectators thought her innocent, and leaves out what follows; that she nevertheless was guilty. Now this is being as culpable as one can conceive, to misrepresent fact in a book, and for what motive? It is like one of those lies which people tell, one cannot see why. The woman&rsquo;s life was spared; and no punishment was too great for the favourite of an Empress who had conspired to dethrone her mistress.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;He was only giving a picture of the lady in her sufferings.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Nay, don&rsquo;t endeavour to palliate this. Guilt is a principal feature in the picture. Kames is puzzled with a question that puzzled me when I was a very young man. Why is it that the interest of money is lower, when money is plentiful; for five pounds has the same proportion of value to a hundred pounds when money is plentiful, as when it is scarce? A lady explained it to me. &ldquo;It is (said she) because when money is plentiful there are so many more who have money to lend, that they bid down one another. Many have then a hundred pounds; and one says, &mdash; Take mine rather than another&rsquo;s, and you shall have it at four <span class="t8">per cent</span>.&rdquo;&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Does Lord Kames decide the question?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;I think he leaves it as he found it.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;This must have been an extraordinary lady who instructed you, Sir. May I ask who she was?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Molly Aston, Sir, the sister of those ladies with whom you dined at Lichfield. I shall be at home to-morrow.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Then let us dine by ourselves at the Mitre, to keep up the old custom, &ldquo;the custom of the manor,&rdquo; the custom of the mitre.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, so it shall be.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Saturday, May 9, we fulfilled our purpose of dining by ourselves at the Mitre, according to old custom. There was, on these occasions, a little circumstance of kind attention to Mrs. Williams, which must not be omitted. Before coming out, and leaving her to dine alone, he gave her choice of a chicken, a sweetbread, or any other little nice thing, which was carefully sent to her from the tavern, ready-drest.</p>
<p class="p24">Our conversation to-day, I know not how, turned, (I think for the only time at any length, during our long acquaintance,) upon the sensual intercourse between the sexes, the delight of which he ascribed chiefly to imagination. &lsquo;Were it not for imagination, Sir, (said he,) a man would be as happy in the arms of a chambermaid as of a Duchess. But such is the adventitious charm of fancy, that we find men who have violated the best principles of society, and ruined their fame and their fortune, that they might possess a woman of rank.&rsquo; It would not be proper to record the particulars of such a conversation in moments of unreserved frankness, when nobody was present on whom it could have any hurtful effect. That subject, when philosophically treated, may surely employ the mind in as curious discussion, and as innocently, as anatomy; provided that those who do treat it keep clear of inflammatory incentives.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;From grave to gay, from lively to severe,&rsquo; &mdash; we were soon engaged in very different speculation; humbly and reverently considering and wondering at the universal mystery of all things, as our imperfect faculties can now judge of them. &lsquo;There are (said he) innumerable questions to which the inquisitive mind can in this state receive no answer: Why do you and I exist? Why was this world created? Since it was to be created, why was it not created sooner?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Sunday, May 10, I supped with him at Mr. Hoole&rsquo;s, with Sir Joshua Reynolds. I have neglected the memorial of this evening, so as to remember no more of it than two particulars; one, that he strenuously opposed an argument by Sir Joshua, that virtue was preferable to vice, considering this life only; and that a man would be virtuous were it only to preserve his character: and that he expressed much wonder at the curious formation of the bat, a mouse with wings; saying, that &lsquo;it was almost as strange a thing in physiology, as if the fabulous dragon could be seen.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Tuesday, May 12, I waited on the Earl of Marchmont, to know if his Lordship would favour Dr. Johnson with information concerning Pope, whose Life he was about to write. Johnson had not flattered himself with the hopes of receiving any civility from this nobleman; for he said to me, when I mentioned Lord Marchmont as one who could tell him a great deal about Pope,&mdash; &lsquo;Sir, he will tell <span class="t8">me</span> nothing.&rsquo; I had the honour of being known to his Lordship, and applied to him of myself, without being commissioned by Johnson. His Lordship behaved in the most polite and obliging manner, promised to tell all he recollected about Pope, and was so very courteous as to say, &lsquo;Tell Dr. Johnson I have a great respect for him, and am ready to shew it in any way I can. I am to be in the city to-morrow, and will call at his house as I return.&rsquo; His Lordship however asked, &lsquo;Will he write the Lives of the Poets impartially? He was the first that brought Whig and Tory into a Dictionary. And what do you think of his definition of Excise? Do you know the history of his aversion to the word <span class="t8">transpire</span>?&rsquo; Then taking down the folio <span class="t8">Dictionary</span>, he shewed it with this censure on its secondary sense: &lsquo;To escape from secrecy to notice; a sense lately innovated from France, without necessity.&rsquo; The truth was Lord Bolingbroke, who left the Jacobites, first used it; therefore, it was to be condemned. &lsquo;He should have shewn what word would do for it, if it was unnecessary.&rsquo; I afterwards put the question to Johnson: &lsquo;Why, Sir, (said he,) <span class="t8">get abroad</span>.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;That, Sir, is using two words.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, there is no end of this. You may as well insist to have a word for old age.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Well, Sir, <span class="t8">Senectus</span>.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Nay, Sir, to insist always that there should be one word to express a thing in English, because there is one in another language, is to change the language.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I availed myself of this opportunity to hear from his Lordship many particulars both of Pope and Lord Bolingbroke, which I have in writing.</p>
<p class="p24">I proposed to Lord Marchmont that he should revise Johnson&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Life of Pope</span>: &lsquo;So (said his Lordship) you would put me in a dangerous situation. You know he knocked down Osborne the bookseller.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Elated with the success of my spontaneous exertion to procure material and respectable aid to Johnson for his very favourite work, <span class="t8">The Lives of the Poets</span>, I hastened down to Mr. Thrale&rsquo;s at Streatham, where he now was, that I might insure his being at home next day; and after dinner, when I thought he would receive the good news in the best humour, I announced it eagerly: &lsquo;I have been at work for you to-day, Sir. I have been with Lord Marchmont. He bade me tell you he has a great respect for you, and will call on you to-morrow at one o&rsquo;clock, and communicate all he knows about Pope.&rsquo; &mdash; Here I paused, in full expectation that he would be pleased with this intelligence, would praise my active merit, and would be alert to embrace such an offer from a nobleman. But whether I had shewn an over-exultation, which provoked his spleen; or whether he was seized with a suspicion that I had obtruded him on Lord Marchmont, and humbled him too much; or whether there was any thing more than an unlucky fit of ill-humour, I know not; but, to my surprize, the result was, &mdash; JOHNSON. &lsquo;I shall not be in town to-morrow. I don&rsquo;t care to know about Pope.&rsquo; MRS. THRALE: (surprized as I was, and a little angry.) &lsquo;I suppose, Sir, Mr. Boswell thought, that as you are to write <span class="t8">Pope&rsquo;s Life</span>, you would wish to know about him.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Wish! why yes. If it rained knowledge I&rsquo;d hold out my hand; but I would not give myself the trouble to go in quest of it.&rsquo; There was no arguing with him at the moment. Some time afterwards he said, &lsquo;Lord Marchmont will call on me, and then I shall call on Lord Marchmont.&rsquo; Mr. Thrale was uneasy at his unaccountable caprice; and told me, that if I did not take care to bring about a meeting between Lord Marchmont and him, it would never take place, which would be a great pity. I sent a card to his Lordship, to be left at Johnson&rsquo;s house, acquainting him, that Dr. Johnson could not be in town next day, but would do himself the honour of waiting on him at another time. I give this account fairly, as a specimen of that unhappy temper with which this great and good man had occasionally to struggle, from something morbid in his constitution. Let the most censorious of my readers suppose himself to have a violent fit of the tooth-ach, or to have received a severe stroke on the shin-bone, and when in such a state to be asked a question; and if he has any candour, he will not be surprized at the answers which Johnson sometimes gave in moments of irritation, which, let me assure them, is exquisitely painful. But it must not be erroneously supposed that he was, in the smallest degree, careless concerning any work which he undertook, or that he was generally thus peevish. It will be seen, that in the following year he had a very agreeable interview with Lord Marchmont, at his Lordship&rsquo;s house; and this very afternoon he soon forgot any fretfulness, and fell into conversation as usual.</p>
<p class="p24">I mentioned a reflection having been thrown out against four Peers for having presumed to rise in opposition to the opinion of the twelve Judges, in a cause in the House of Lords, as if that were indecent. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, there is no ground for censure. The Peers are Judges themselves; and supposing them really to be of a different opinion, they might from duty be in opposition to the Judges, who were there only to be consulted.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">In this observation I fully concurred with him; for, unquestionably, all the Peers are vested with the highest judicial powers; and when they are confident that they understand a cause, are not obliged, nay ought not to acquiesce in the opinion of the ordinary Law Judges, or even in that of those who from their studies and experience are called the Law Lords. I consider the Peers in general as I do a Jury, who ought to listen with respectful attention to the sages of the law; but, if after hearing them, they have a firm opinion of their own, are bound, as honest men, to decide accordingly. Nor is it so difficult for them to understand even law questions, as is generally thought; provided they will bestow sufficient attention upon them. This observation was made by my honoured relation the late Lord Cathcart, who had spent his life in camps and courts; yet assured me, that he could form a clear opinion upon most of the causes that came before the House of Lords, &lsquo;as they were so well enucleated in the Cases.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Mrs. Thrale told us, that a curious clergyman of our acquaintance had discovered a licentious stanza, which Pope had originally in his <span class="t8">Universal Prayer</span>, before the stanza,</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;What conscience dictates to be done,<br/>Or warns us not to do,&rsquo; &amp;c.</p>
<p class="p24">It was thus: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;Can sins of moment claim the rod<br/>Of everlasting fires?<br/>And that offend great Nature&rsquo;s GOD,<br/>Which Nature&rsquo;s self inspires?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">and that Dr. Johnson observed, &lsquo;it had been borrowed from <span class="t8">Guarini</span>.&rsquo; There are, indeed, in <span class="t8">Pastor Fido</span>, many such flimsy superficial reasonings, as that in the last two lines of this stanza. BOSWELL. &lsquo;In that stanza of Pope&rsquo;s, &ldquo;<span class="t8">rod of fires</span>&rdquo; is certainly a bad metaphor.&rsquo; MRS. THRALE. &lsquo;And &ldquo;sins of <span class="t8">moment</span>&rdquo; is a faulty expression; for its true import is <span class="t8">momentous</span>, which cannot be intended.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;It must have been written &ldquo;of <span class="t8">moments</span>.&rdquo; Of <span class="t8">moment</span>, is <span class="t8">momentous</span>; of <span class="t8">moments</span>, <span class="t8">momentary</span>. I warrant you, however, Pope wrote this stanza, and some friend struck it out. Boileau wrote some such thing, and Arnaud struck it out, saying, &ldquo;<span class="t8">Vous gagnerez deux ou trois impies, et perdrez je ne scais combien des honnettes gens</span>.&rdquo; These fellows want to say a daring thing, and don&rsquo;t know how to go about it. Mere poets know no more of fundamental principles than &mdash; .&rsquo; Here he was interrupted somehow. Mrs. Thrale mentioned Dryden. JOHNSON. &lsquo;He puzzled himself about predestination. &mdash; How foolish was it in Pope to give all his friendship to Lords, who thought they honoured him by being with him; and to choose such Lords as Burlington, and Cobham, and Bolingbroke! Bathurst was negative, a pleasing man; and I have heard no ill of Marchmont; and then always saying, &ldquo;I do not value you for being a Lord;&rdquo; which was a sure proof that he did. I never say, I do not value Boswell more for being born to an estate, because I do not care.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Nor for being a Scotchman?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Nay, Sir, I do value you more for being a Scotchman. You are a Scotchman without the faults of a Scotchman. You would not have been so valuable as you are, had you not been a Scotchman.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Talking of divorces, I asked if Othello&rsquo;s doctrine was not plausible?</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;He that is robb&rsquo;d, not wanting what is stolen,<br/>Let him not know&rsquo;t, and he&rsquo;s not robb&rsquo;d at all.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Dr. Johnson and Mrs. Thrale joined against this. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Ask any man if he&rsquo;d wish not to know of such an injury.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Would you tell your friend to make him unhappy?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Perhaps, Sir, I should not; but that would be from prudence on my own account. A man would tell his father.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Yes; because he would not have spurious children to get any share of the family inheritance.&rsquo; MRS. THRALE. &lsquo;Or he would tell his brother.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Certainly his <span class="t8">elder</span> brother.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;You would tell your friend of a woman&rsquo;s infamy, to prevent his marrying a whore: there is the same reason to tell him of his wife&rsquo;s infidelity, when he is married, to prevent the consequences of imposition. It is a breach of confidence not to tell a friend.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Would you tell Mr. &mdash;&mdash; ?&rsquo; (naming a gentleman who assuredly was not in the least danger of such a miserable disgrace, though married to a fine woman.) JOHNSON. &lsquo;No, Sir; because it would do no good: he is so sluggish, he&rsquo;d never go to parliament and get through a divorce.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He said of one of our friends, &lsquo;He is ruining himself without pleasure. A man who loses at play, or who runs out his fortune at court, makes his estate less, in hopes of making it bigger: (I am sure of this word, which was often used by him:) but it is a sad thing to pass through the quagmire of parsimony, to the gulph of ruin. To pass over the flowery path of extravagance is very well.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Amongst the numerous prints pasted on the walls of the dining-room at Streatham, was Hogarth&rsquo;s &lsquo;Modern Midnight Conversation.&rsquo; I asked him what he knew of Parson Ford, who makes a conspicuous figure in the riotous group. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, he was my acquaintance and relation, my mother&rsquo;s nephew. He had purchased a living in the country, but not simoniacally. I never saw him but in the country. I have been told he was a man of great parts; very profligate, but I never heard he was impious.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Was there not a story of his ghost having appeared?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, it was believed. A waiter at the Hummums, in which house Ford died, had been absent for some time, and returned, not knowing that Ford was dead. Going down to the cellar, according to the story, he met him; going down again he met him a second time. When he came up, he asked some of the people of the house what Ford could be doing there. They told him Ford was dead. The waiter took a fever, in which he lay for some time. When he recovered, he said he had a message to deliver to some women from Ford; but he was not to tell what, or to whom. He walked out; he was followed; but somewhere about St. Paul&rsquo;s they lost him. He came back, and said he had delivered the message, and the women exclaimed, &ldquo;Then we are all undone!&rdquo; Dr. Pellet, who was not a credulous man, inquired into the truth of this story, and he said, the evidence was irresistible. My wife went to the Hummums; (it is a place where people get themselves cupped.) I believe she went with intention to hear about this story of Ford. At first they were unwilling to tell her; but, after they had talked to her, she came away satisfied that it was true. To be sure the man had a fever; and this vision may have been the beginning of it. But if the message to the women, and their behaviour upon it, were true as related, there was something supernatural. That rests upon his word; and there it remains.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">After Mrs. Thrale was gone to bed, Johnson and I sat up late. We resumed Sir Joshua Reynolds&rsquo;s argument on the preceding Sunday, that a man would be virtuous though he had no other motive than to preserve his character. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, it is not true: for as to this world vice does not hurt a man&rsquo;s character.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Yes, Sir, debauching a friend&rsquo;s wife will.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;No, Sir. Who thinks the worse of &mdash;&mdash; for it?&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Lord &mdash;&mdash; was not his friend.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;That is only a circumstance, Sir; a slight distinction. He could not get into the house but by Lord &mdash;&mdash; . A man is chosen Knight of the shire, not the less for having debauched ladies.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;What, Sir, if he debauched the ladies of gentlemen in the county, will not there be a general resentment against him?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;No, Sir. He will lose those particular gentlemen; but the rest will not trouble their heads about it.&rsquo; (warmly.) BOSWELL. &lsquo;Well, Sir, I cannot think so.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Nay, Sir, there is no talking with a man who will dispute what every body knows, (angrily.) Don&rsquo;t you know this?&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;No, Sir; and I wish to think better of your country than you represent it. I knew in Scotland a gentleman obliged to leave it for debauching a lady; and in one of our counties an Earl&rsquo;s brother lost his election, because he had debauched the lady of another Earl in that county, and destroyed the peace of a noble family.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Still he would not yield. He proceeded: &lsquo;Will you not allow, Sir, that vice does not hurt a man&rsquo;s character so as to obstruct his prosperity in life, when you know that &mdash;&mdash; was loaded with wealth and honours; a man who had acquired his fortune by such crimes, that his consciousness of them impelled him to cut his own throat.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;You will recollect, Sir, that Dr. Robertson said, he cut his throat because he was weary of still life; little things not being sufficient to move his great mind.&rsquo; JOHNSON, (very angry.) &lsquo;Nay, Sir, what stuff is this! You had no more this opinion after Robertson said it, than before. I know nothing more offensive than repeating what one knows to be foolish things, by way of continuing a dispute, to see what a man will answer, &mdash; to make him your butt!&rsquo; (angrier still.) BOSWELL. &lsquo;My dear Sir, I had no such intentions as you seem to suspect; I had not indeed. Might not this nobleman have felt every thing &ldquo;weary, stale, flat, and unprofitable,&rdquo; as Hamlet says?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Nay, if you are to bring in gabble, I&rsquo;ll talk no more. I will not, upon my honour.&rsquo; &mdash; My readers will decide upon this dispute.</p>
<p class="p24">Next morning I stated to Mrs. Thrale at breakfast, before he came down, the dispute of last night as to the influence of character upon success in life. She said he was certainly wrong; and told me, that a Baronet lost an election in Wales, because he had debauched the sister of a gentleman in the county, whom he made one of his daughters invite as her companion at his seat in the country, when his lady and his other children were in London. But she would not encounter Johnson upon the subject.</p>
<p class="p24">I staid all this day with him at Streatham. He talked a great deal, in very good humour.</p>
<p class="p24">Looking at Messrs. Dilly&rsquo;s splendid edition of Lord Chesterfield&rsquo;s miscellaneous works, he laughed, and said, &lsquo;Here now are two speeches ascribed to him, both of which were written by me: and the best of it is, they have found out that one is like Demosthenes, and the other like Cicero.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He censured Lord Kames&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Sketches of the History of Man</span>, for misrepresenting Clarendon&rsquo;s account of the appearance of Sir George Villiers&rsquo;s ghost, as if Clarendon were weakly credulous; when the truth is, that Clarendon only says, that the story was upon a better foundation of credit, than usually such discourses are founded upon; nay, speaks thus of the person who was reported to have seen the vision, &lsquo;the poor man, <span class="t8">if he had been at all waking</span>;&rsquo; which Lord Kames has omitted. He added, &lsquo;in this book it is maintained that virtue is natural to man, and that if we would but consult our own hearts we should be virtuous. Now after consulting our own hearts all we can, and with all the helps we have, we find how few of us are virtuous. This is saying a thing which all mankind know not to be true.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Is not modesty natural?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;I cannot say, Sir, as we find no people quite in a state of nature; but I think the more they are taught, the more modest they are. The French are a gross, ill-bred, untaught people; a lady there will spit on the floor and rub it with her foot. What I gained by being in France was, learning to be better satisfied with my own country. Time may be employed to more advantage from nineteen to twenty-four almost in any way than in travelling; when you set travelling against mere negation, against doing nothing, it is better to be sure; but how much more would a young man improve were he to study during those years. Indeed, if a young man is wild, and must run after women and bad company, it is better this should be done abroad, as, on his return, he can break off such connections, and begin at home a new man, with a character to form, and acquaintances to make. How little does travelling supply to the conversation of any man who has travelled; how little to Beauclerk!&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;What say you to Lord &mdash;&mdash; ?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;I never but once heard him talk of what he had seen, and that was of a large serpent in one of the Pyramids of Egypt.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Well, I happened to hear him tell the same thing, which made me mention him.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I talked of a country life. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Were I to live in the country, I would not devote myself to the acquisition of popularity; I would live in a much better way, much more happily; I would have my time at my own command.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;But, Sir, is it not a sad thing to be at a distance from all our literary friends?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, you will by and by have enough of this conversation, which now delights you so much.&rsquo; </p>
<p class="p24">As he was a zealous friend of subordination, he was at all times watchful to repress the vulgar cant against the manners of the great;&nbsp; High people, Sir, (said he,) are the best; take a hundred ladies of quality, you&rsquo;ll find them better wives, better mothers, more willing to sacrifice their own pleasure to their children than a hundred other women. Tradeswomen (I mean the wives of tradesmen) in the city, who are worth from ten to fifteen thousand pounds, are the worst creatures upon the earth, grossly ignorant, and thinking viciousness fashionable. Farmers, I think, are often worthless fellows. Few lords will cheat; and, if they do, they&rsquo;ll be ashamed of it: farmers cheat and are not ashamed of it: they have all the sensual vices too of the nobility, with cheating into the bargain. There is as much fornication and adultery among farmers as amongst noblemen.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;The notion of the world, Sir, however is, that the morals of women of quality are worse than those in lower stations.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Yes, Sir, the licentiousness of one woman of quality makes more noise than that of a number of women in lower stations; then, Sir, you are to consider the malignity of women in the city against women of quality, which will make them believe any thing of them, such as that they call their coachmen to bed. No, Sir, so far as I have observed, the higher in rank, the richer ladies are, they are the better instructed and the more virtuous.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">This year the Reverend Mr. Horne published his <span class="t8">Letter to Mr. Dunning on the English Particle</span>; Johnson read it, and though not treated in it with sufficient respect, he had candour enough to say to Mr. Seward, &lsquo;Were I to make a new edition of my <span class="t8">Dictionary</span>, I would adopt several of Mr. Horne&rsquo;s etymologies; I hope they did not put the dog in the pillory for his libel; he has too much literature for that.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Saturday, May 16, I dined with him at Mr. Beauclerk&rsquo;s with Mr. Langton, Mr. Steevens, Dr. Higgins, and some others. I regret very feelingly every instance of my remissness in recording his <span class="t8">memorabilia</span>; I am afraid it is the condition of humanity (as Mr. Windham, of Norfolk, once observed to me, after having made an admirable speech in the House of Commons, which was highly applauded, but which he afterwards perceived might have been better:) &lsquo;that we are more uneasy from thinking of our wants, than happy in thinking of our acquisitions.&rsquo; This is an unreasonable mode of disturbing our tranquillity, and should be corrected; let me then comfort myself with the large treasure of Johnson&rsquo;s conversation which I have preserved for my own enjoyment and that of the world, and let me exhibit what I have upon each occasion, whether more or less, whether a bulse, or only a few sparks of a diamond.</p>
<p class="p24">He said, &lsquo;Dr. Mead lived more in the broad sunshine of life than almost any man.&rsquo; The disaster of General Burgoyne&rsquo;s army was then the common topic of conversation. It was asked why piling their arms was insisted upon as a matter of such consequence, when it seemed to be a circumstance so inconsiderable in itself. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, a French authour says, &ldquo;<span class="t8">Il y a beaucoup de puerilités dans la guerre</span>.&rdquo; All distinctions are trifles, because great things can seldom occur, and those distinctions are settled by custom. A savage would as willingly have his meat sent to him in the kitchen, as eat it at the table here; as men become civilized, various modes of denoting honourable preference are invented.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He this day made the observations upon the similarity between <span class="t8">Rasselas</span> and <span class="t8">Candide</span>, which I have inserted in its proper place, when considering his admirable philosophical Romance. He said <span class="t8">Candide</span> he thought had more power in it than any thing that <span class="t8">Voltaire</span> had written.</p>
<p class="p24">He said, &lsquo;the lyrical part of Horace never can be perfectly translated; so much of the excellence is in the numbers and the expression. Francis has done it the best; I&rsquo;ll take his, five out of six, against them all.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Sunday, May 17, I presented to him Mr. Fullarton, of Fullarton, who has since distinguished himself so much in India, to whom he naturally talked of travels, as Mr. Brydone accompanied him in his tour to Sicily and Malta. He said, &lsquo;The information which we have from modern travellers is much more authentick than what we had from ancient travellers; ancient travellers guessed; modern travellers measure. The Swiss admit that there is but one errour in Stanyan. If Brydone were more attentive to his Bible, he would be a good traveller.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He said, &lsquo;Lord Chatham was a Dictator; he possessed the power of putting the State in motion; now there is no power, all order is relaxed.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Is there no hope of a change to the better?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, yes, Sir, when we are weary of this relaxation. So the City of London will appoint its Mayors again by seniority.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;But is not that taking a mere chance for having a good or a bad Mayor?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Yes, Sir; but the evil of competition is greater than that of the worst Mayor that can come; besides, there is no more reason to suppose that the choice of a rabble will be right, than that chance will be right.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Tuesday, May 19, I was to set out for Scotland in the evening. He was engaged to dine with me at Mr. Dilly&rsquo;s, I waited upon him to remind him of his appointment and attend him thither; he gave me some salutary counsel, and recommended vigorous resolution against any deviation from moral duty. BOSWELL. &lsquo;But you would not have me to bind myself by a solemn obligation?&rsquo; JOHNSON, (much agitated) &lsquo;What! a vow &mdash; O, no, Sir, a vow is a horrible thing, it is a snare for sin. The man who cannot go to Heaven without a vow &mdash; may go &mdash; .&rsquo; Here, standing erect, in the middle of his library, and rolling grand, his pause was truly a curious compound of the solemn and the ludicrous; he half-whistled in his usual way, when pleasant, and he paused, as if checked by religious awe. Methought he would have added &mdash; to Hell &mdash; but was restrained. I humoured the dilemma. &lsquo;What! Sir, (said I,) <span class="t8">In cælum jusseris ibit</span>?&rsquo; alluding to his imitation of it, &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;And bid him go to Hell, to Hell he goes.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I had mentioned to him a slight fault in his noble <span class="t8">Imitation of the Tenth Satire of Juvenal</span>, a too near recurrence of the verb <span class="t8">spread</span>, in his description of the young Enthusiast at College: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;Through all his veins the fever of renown,<br/><span class="t8">Spreads</span> from the strong contagion of the gown;<br/>O&rsquo;er Bodley&rsquo;s dome his future labours <span class="t8">spread</span>,<br/>And Bacon&rsquo;s mansion trembles o&rsquo;er his head.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He had desired me to change <span class="t8">spreads</span> to <span class="t8">burns</span>, but for perfect authenticity, I now had it done with his own hand. I thought this alteration not only cured the fault, but was more poetical, as it might carry an allusion to the shirt by which Hercules was inflamed.</p>
<p class="p24">We had a quiet comfortable meeting at Mr. Dilly&rsquo;s; nobody there but ourselves. Mr. Dilly mentioned somebody having wished that Milton&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Tractate on Education</span> should be printed along with his Poems in the edition of <span class="t8">The English Poets</span> then going on. JOHNSON. &lsquo;It would be breaking in upon the plan; but would be of no great consequence. So far as it would be any thing, it would be wrong. Education in England has been in danger of being hurt by two of its greatest men, Milton and Locke. Milton&rsquo;s plan is impracticable, and I suppose has never been tried. Locke&rsquo;s, I fancy, has been tried often enough, but is very imperfect; it gives too much to one side, and too little to the other; it gives too little to literature. &mdash; I shall do what I can for Dr. Watts; but my materials are very scanty. His poems are by no means his best works; I cannot praise his poetry itself highly; but I can praise its design.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">My illustrious friend and I parted with assurances of affectionate regard.</p>
<p class="p24">I wrote to him on the 25th of May, from Thorpe in Yorkshire, one of the seats of Mr. Bosville, and gave him an account of my having passed a day at Lincoln, unexpectedly, and therefore without having any letters of introduction, but that I had been honoured with civilities from the Reverend Mr. Simpson, an acquaintance of his, and Captain Broadley, of the Lincolnshire Militia; but more particularly from the Reverend Dr. Gordon, the Chancellor, who first received me with great politeness as a stranger, and when I informed him who I was, entertained me at his house with the most flattering attention; I also expressed the pleasure with which I had found that our worthy friend Langton was highly esteemed in his own county town.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To DR. SAMUEL JOHNSON.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Edinburgh, June 18, 1778.</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">&lsquo;MY DEAR SIR,</span></p>
<p class="p10">* * * * *</p>
<p class="p21">&lsquo;Since my return to Scotland, I have been again at Lanark, and have had more conversation with Thomson&rsquo;s sister. It is strange that Murdoch, who was his intimate friend, should have mistaken his mother&rsquo;s maiden name, which he says was Hume, whereas Hume was the name of his grandmother by the mother&rsquo;s side. His mother&rsquo;s name was Beatrix Trotter, a daughter of Mr. Trotter, of Fogo, a small proprietor of land. Thomson had one brother, whom he had with him in England as his amanuensis; but he was seized with a consumption, and having returned to Scotland, to try what his native air would do for him, died young. He had three sisters, one married to Mr. Bell, minister of the parish of Strathaven; one to Mr. Craig, father of the ingenious architect, who gave the plan of the New Town of Edinburgh; and one to Mr. Thomson, master of the grammar-school at Lanark. He was of a humane and benevolent disposition; not only sent valuable presents to his sisters, but a yearly allowance in money, and was always wishing to have it in his power to do them more good. Lord Lyttelton&rsquo;s observation, that &ldquo;he loathed much to write,&rdquo; was very true. His letters to his sister, Mrs. Thomson, were not frequent, and in one of them he says, &ldquo;All my friends who know me, know how backward I am to write letters; and never impute the negligence of my hand to the coldness of my heart.&rdquo; I send you a copy of the last letter which she had from him; she never heard that he had any intention of going into holy orders. From this late interview with his sister, I think much more favourably of him, as I hope you will. I am eager to see more of your Prefaces to the Poets; I solace myself with the few proof-sheets which I have.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I send another parcel of Lord Hailes&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Annals</span>, which you will please to return to me as soon as you conveniently can. He says, &ldquo;he wishes you would cut a little deeper;&rdquo; but he may be proud that there is so little occasion to use the critical knife. I ever am, my dear Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your faithful and affectionate,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;humble servant,</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;JAMES BOSWELL.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Mr. Langton has been pleased, at my request, to favour me with some particulars of Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s visit to Warley-camp, where this gentleman was at the time stationed as a Captain in the Lincolnshire militia. I shall give them in his own words in a letter to me.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;It was in the summer of the year 1778, that he complied with my invitation to come down to the Camp at Warley, and he staid with me about a week; the scene appeared, notwithstanding a great degree of ill health that he seemed to labour under, to interest and amuse him, as agreeing with the disposition that I believe you know he constantly manifested towards enquiring into subjects of the military kind. He sate, with a patient degree of attention, to observe the proceedings of a regimental court-martial, that happened to be called, in the time of his stay with us; and one night, as late as at eleven o&rsquo;clock, he accompanied the Major of the regiment in going what are styled the <span class="t8">Rounds</span>, where he might observe the forms of visiting the guards, for the seeing that they and their sentries are ready in their duty on their several posts. He took occasion to converse at times on military topicks, one in particular, that I see the mention of, in your <span class="t8">Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides</span>, which lies open before me, as to gun-powder; which he spoke of to the same effect, in part, that you relate.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;On one occasion, when the regiment were going through their exercise, he went quite close to the men at one of the extremities of it, and watched all their practices attentively; and, when he came away, his remark was, &ldquo;The men indeed do load their muskets and fire with wonderful celerity.&rdquo; He was likewise particular in requiring to know what was the weight of the musquet balls in use, and within what distance they might be expected to take effect when fired off.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;In walking among the tents, and observing the difference between those of the officers and private men, he said that the superiority of accommodation of the better conditions of life, to that of the inferiour ones, was never exhibited to him in so distinct a view. The civilities paid to him in the camp were, from the gentlemen of the Lincolnshire regiment, one of the officers of which accommodated him with a tent in which he slept; and from General Hall, who very courteously invited him to dine with him, where he appeared to be very well pleased with his entertainment, and the civilities he received on the part of the General; the attention likewise, of the General&rsquo;s aid-de-camp, Captain Smith, seemed to be very welcome to him, as appeared by their engaging in a great deal of discourse together. The gentlemen of the East York regiment likewise on being informed of his coming, solicited his company at dinner, but by that time he had fixed his departure, so that he could not comply with the invitation.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To JAMES BOSWELL, ESQ.</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I have received two letters from you, of which the second complains of the neglect shewn to the first. You must not tye your friends to such punctual correspondence. You have all possible assurances of my affection and esteem; and there ought to be no need of reiterated professions. When it may happen that I can give you either counsel or comfort, I hope it will never happen to me that I should neglect you; but you must not think me criminal or cold if I say nothing when I have nothing to say.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;You are now happy enough. Mrs. Boswell is recovered; and I congratulate you upon the probability of her long life. If general approbation will add anything to your enjoyment, I can tell you that I have heard you mentioned as <span class="t8">a man whom everybody likes</span>. I think life has little more to give.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo; &mdash;&mdash; has gone to his regiment. He has laid down his coach, and talks of making more contractions of his expence: how he will succeed I know not. It is difficult to reform a household gradually; it may be better done by a system totally new. I am afraid he has always something to hide. When we pressed him to go to &mdash;&mdash; , he objected the necessity of attending his navigation; yet he could talk of going to Aberdeen, a place not much nearer his navigation. I believe he cannot bear the thought of living at &mdash;&mdash; in a state of diminution; and of appearing among the gentlemen of the neighbourhood <span class="t8">shorn of his beams</span>. This is natural, but it is cowardly. What I told him of the encreasing expence of a growing family seems to have struck him. He certainly had gone on with very confused views, and we have, I think, shewn him that he is wrong; though, with the common deficiency of advisers, we have not shewn him how to do right.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I wish you would a little correct or restrain your imagination, and imagine that happiness, such as life admits, may be had at other places as well as London. Without asserting Stoicism, it may be said, that it is our business to exempt ourselves as much as we can from the power of external things. There is but one solid basis of happiness; and that is, the reasonable hope of a happy futurity. This may be had every where.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I do not blame your preference of London to other places, for it is really to be preferred, if the choice is free; but few have the choice of their place, or their manner of life; and mere pleasure ought not to be the prime motive of action.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Mrs. Thrale, poor thing, has a daughter. Mr. Thrale dislikes the times, like the rest of us. Mrs. Williams is sick; Mrs. Desmoulins is poor. I have miserable nights. Nobody is well but Mr. Levett.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am, dear Sir, Your most, &amp;c.</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;London, July 3, 1778.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">In the course of this year there was a difference between him and his friend Mr. Strahan; the particulars of which it is unnecessary to relate. Their reconciliation was communicated to me in a letter from Mr. Strahan, in the following words: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The notes I shewed you that passed between him and me were dated in March last. The matter lay dormant till July 27, when he wrote to me as follows:</p>
<p class="p24">&ldquo;To William Strahan, Esq.</p>
<p class="p24">&ldquo;Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&ldquo;It would be very foolish for us to continue strangers any longer. You can never by persistency make wrong right. If I resented too acrimoniously, I resented only to yourself. Nobody ever saw or heard what I wrote. You saw that my anger was over, for in a day or two I came to your house. I have given you longer time; and I hope you have made so good use of it, as to be no longer on evil terms with, Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&ldquo;Your, &amp;c.</p>
<p class="p24">&ldquo;Sam. Johnson.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;On this I called upon him; and he has since dined with me.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">After this time, the same friendship as formerly continued between Dr. Johnson and Mr. Strahan. My friend mentioned to me a little circumstance of his attention, which, though we may smile at it, must be allowed to have its foundation in a nice and true knowledge of human life. &lsquo;When I write to Scotland, (said he,) I employ Strahan to frank my letters, that he may have the consequence of appearing a Parliament-man among his countrymen.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To CAPTAIN LANGTON, WARLEY-CAMP.</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;When I recollect how long ago I was received with so much kindness at Warley Common, I am ashamed that I have not made some enquiries after my friends.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Pray how many sheep-stealers did you convict? and how did you punish them? When are you to be cantoned in better habitations? The air grows cold, and the ground damp. Longer stay in the camp cannot be without much danger to the health of the common men, if even the officers can escape.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;You see that Dr. Percy is now Dean of Carlisle; about five hundred a year, with a power of presenting himself to some good living. He is provided for.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The session of the CLUB is to commence with that of the Parliament. Mr. Banks desires to be admitted; he will be a very honourable accession.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Did the King please you? The Coxheath men, I think, have some reason to complain: Reynolds says your camp is better than theirs.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I hope you find yourself able to encounter this weather. Take care of your own health; and, as you can, of your men. Be pleased to make my compliments to all the gentlemen whose notice I have had, and whose kindness I have experienced.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am, dear Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your most humble servant,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Sam. Johnson.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;October 31, 1778.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I wrote to him on the 18th of August, the 18th of September, and the 6th of November; informing him of my having had another son born, whom I had called James; that I had passed some time at Auchinleck; that the Countess of Loudoun, now in her ninety-ninth year, was as fresh as when he saw her, and remembered him with respect; and that his mother by adoption, the Countess of Eglintoune, had said to me, &lsquo;Tell Mr. Johnson I love him exceedingly;&rsquo; that I had again suffered much from bad spirits; and that as it was very long since I heard from him, I was not a little uneasy.</p>
<p class="p24">The continuance of his regard for his friend Dr. Burney, appears from the following letters: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To THE REVEREND DR. WHEELER, OXFORD.</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Dr. Burney, who brings this paper, is engaged in a History of Musick; and having been told by Dr. Markham of some MSS. relating to his subject, which are in the library of your College, is desirous to examine them. He is my friend; and therefore I take the liberty of intreating your favour and assistance in his enquiry: and can assure you, with great confidence, that if you knew him he would not want any intervenient solicitation to obtain the kindness of one who loves learning and virtue as you love them.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I have been flattering myself all the summer with the hope of paying my annual visit to my friends; but something has obstructed me: I still hope not to be long without seeing you. I should be glad of a little literary talk; and glad to shew you, by the frequency of my visits, how eagerly I love it, when you talk it.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am, dear Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your most humble servant,</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;London, November 2, 1778.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">&lsquo;TO THE REVEREND DR. EDWARDS, OXFORD.</span></p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The bearer, DR. BURNEY, has had some account of a Welsh Manuscript in the Bodleian library, from which he hopes to gain some materials for his History of Musick; but being ignorant of the language, is at a loss where to find assistance. I make no doubt but you, Sir, can help him through his difficulties, and therefore take the liberty of recommending him to your favour, as I am sure you will find him a man worthy of every civility that can be shewn, and every benefit that can be conferred.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;But we must not let Welsh drive us from Greek. What comes of Xenophon? If you do not like the trouble of publishing the book, do not let your commentaries be lost; contrive that they may be published somewhere.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am, Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your humble servant,</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;London, November 2, 1778.</p>
<p class="p24">These letters procured Dr. Burney great kindness and friendly offices from both of these gentleman, not only on that occasion, but in future visits to the university. The same year Dr. Johnson not only wrote to Dr. Joseph Warton in favour of Dr. Burney&rsquo;s youngest son, who was to be placed in the college of Winchester, but accompanied him when he went thither.</p>
<p class="p24">We surely cannot but admire the benevolent exertions of this great and good man, especially when we consider how grievously he was afflicted with bad health, and how uncomfortable his home was made by the perpetual jarring of those whom he charitably accommodated under his roof. He has sometimes suffered me to talk jocularly of his group of females, and call them his <span class="t8">Seraglio</span>. He thus mentions them, together with honest Levett, in one of his letters to Mrs. Thrale: &lsquo;Williams hates every body; Levett hates Desmoulins, and does not love Williams; Desmoulins hates them both; Poll loves none of them.&rsquo; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To JAMES BOSWELL, ESQ.</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;It is indeed a long time since I wrote, and I think you have some reason to complain; however, you must not let small things disturb you, when you have such a fine addition to your happiness as a new boy, and I hope your lady&rsquo;s health restored by bringing him. It seems very probable that a little care will now restore her, if any remains of her complaints are left.</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;You seem, if I understand your letter, to be gaining ground at<br/>Auchinleck, an incident that would give me great delight.</p>
<p class="p10">* * * * *</p>
<p class="p21">&lsquo;When any fit of anxiety, or gloominess, or perversion of mind, lays hold upon you, make it a rule not to publish it by complaints, but exert your whole care to hide it; by endeavouring to hide it, you will drive it away. Be always busy.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The CLUB is to meet with the Parliament; we talk of electing Banks, the traveller; he will be a reputable member.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Langton has been encamped with his company of militia on Warley-common; I spent five days amongst them; he signalized himself as a diligent officer, and has very high respect in the regiment. He presided when I was there at a court-martial; he is now quartered in Hertfordshire; his lady and little ones are in Scotland. Paoli came to the camp and commended the soldiers.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Of myself I have no great matter to say, my health is not restored, my nights are restless and tedious. The best night that I have had these twenty years was at Fort-Augustus.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I hope soon to send you a few lines to read.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am, dear Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your most affectionate,</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;November 21, 1778.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">About this time the Rev. Mr. John Hussey, who had been some time in trade, and was then a clergyman of the Church of England, being about to undertake a journey to Aleppo, and other parts of the East, which he accomplished, Dr. Johnson, (who had long been in habits of intimacy with him,) honoured him with the following letter: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To MR. JOHN HUSSEY.</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I have sent you the <span class="t8">Grammar</span>, and have left you two books more, by which I hope to be remembered; write my name in them; we may perhaps see each other no more, you part with my good wishes, nor do I despair of seeing you return. Let no opportunities of vice corrupt you; let no bad example seduce you; let the blindness of Mahometans confirm you in Christianity. GOD bless you.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am, dear Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your affectionate humble servant,</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;December 29, 1778.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson this year expressed great satisfaction at the publication of the first volume of <span class="t8">Discourses to the Royal Academy</span>, by Sir Joshua Reynolds, whom he always considered as one of his literary school. Much praise indeed is due to those excellent <span class="t8">Discourses</span>, which are so universally admired, and for which the authour received from the Empress of Russia a gold snuff-box, adorned with her profile in <span class="t8">bas relief</span>, set in diamonds; and containing what is infinitely more valuable, a slip of paper, on which are written with her Imperial Majesty&rsquo;s own hand, the following words: &lsquo;<span class="t8">Pour le Chevalier Reynolds en témoignage du contentement que j&rsquo;ai ressentie à la lecture de ses excellens discours sur la peinture</span>.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">In 1779, Johnson gave the world a luminous proof that the vigour of his mind in all its faculties, whether memory, judgement, or imagination, was not in the least abated; for this year came out the first four volumes of his <span class="t8">Prefaces, biographical and critical, to the most eminent of the English Poets</span>,[*] published by the booksellers of London. The remaining volumes came out in the year 1780. The Poets were selected by the several booksellers who had the honorary copy right, which is still preserved among them by mutual compact, notwithstanding the decision of the House of Lords against the perpetuity of Literary Property. We have his own authority, that by his recommendation the poems of Blackmore, Watts, Pomfret, and Yalden, were added to the collection. Of this work I shall speak more particularly hereafter.</p>
<p class="p24">On the 22nd of January, I wrote to him on several topicks, and mentioned that as he had been so good as to permit me to have the proof sheets of his <span class="t8">Lives of the Poets</span>, I had written to his servant, Francis, to take care of them for me.</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">&lsquo;MR. BOSWELL TO DR. JOHNSON.</span></p>
<p class="p21">&lsquo;Edinburgh, Feb. 2, 1779.</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">&lsquo;MY DEAR SIR,</span></p>
<p class="p21">&lsquo;Garrick&rsquo;s death is a striking event; not that we should be surprised with the death of any man, who has lived sixty-two years; but because there was a <span class="t8">vivacity</span> in our late celebrated friend, which drove away the thoughts of <span class="t8">death</span> from any association with <span class="t8">him</span>. I am sure you will be tenderly affected with his departure; and I would wish to hear from you upon the subject. I was obliged to him in my days of effervescence in London, when poor Derrick was my governour; and since that time I received many civilities from him. Do you remember how pleasing it was, when I received a letter from him at Inverary, upon our first return to civilized living after our Hebridean journey? I shall always remember him with affection as well as admiration.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;On Saturday last, being the 30th of January, I drank coffee and old port, and had solemn conversation with the Reverend Mr. Falconer, a nonjuring bishop, a very learned and worthy man. He gave two toasts, which you will believe I drank with cordiality, Dr. Samuel Johnson, and Flora Macdonald. I sat about four hours with him, and it was really as if I had been living in the last century. The Episcopal Church of Scotland, though faithful to the royal house of Stuart, has never accepted of any <span class="t8">congé d&rsquo;liré</span>, since the Revolution; it is the only true Episcopal Church in Scotland, as it has its own succession of bishops. For as to the episcopal clergy who take the oaths to the present government, they indeed follow the rites of the Church of England, but, as Bishop Falconer observed, &ldquo;they are not <span class="t8">Episcopals</span>; for they are under no bishop, as a bishop cannot have authority beyond his diocese.&rdquo; This venerable gentleman did me the honour to dine with me yesterday, and he laid his hands upon the heads of my little ones. We had a good deal of curious literary conversation, particularly about Mr. Thomas Ruddiman, with whom he lived in great friendship.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Any fresh instance of the uncertainty of life makes one embrace more closely a valuable friend. My dear and much respected Sir, may GOD preserve you long in this world while I am in it.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am ever,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your much obliged,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;And affectionate humble servant,</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;JAMES BOSWELL.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On the 23rd of February I wrote to him again, complaining of his silence, as I had heard he was ill, and had written to Mr. Thrale, for information concerning him; and I announced my intention of soon being again in London.</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">&lsquo;TO JAMES BOSWELL, ESQ.</span></p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Why should you take such delight to make a bustle, to write to Mr. Thrale that I am negligent, and to Francis to do what is so very unnecessary. Thrale, you may be sure, cared not about it; and I shall spare Francis the trouble, by ordering a set both of the <span class="t8">Lives</span> and <span class="t8">Poets</span> to dear Mrs. Boswell, in acknowledgement of her marmalade. Persuade her to accept them, and accept them kindly. If I thought she would receive them scornfully, I would send them to Miss Boswell, who, I hope, has yet none of her mamma&rsquo;s ill-will to me.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I would send sets of <span class="t8">Lives</span>, four volumes, to some other friends, to Lord Hailes first. His second volume lies by my bed-side; a book surely of great labour, and to every just thinker of great delight. Write me word to whom I shall send besides; would it please Lord Auchinleck? Mrs. Thrale waits in the coach.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am, dear Sir, &amp;c.,</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;March 13, 1779.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">This letter crossed me on the road to London, where I arrived on Monday, March 15, and next morning at a late hour, found Dr. Johnson sitting over his tea, attended by Mrs. Desmoulins, Mr. Levett, and a clergyman, who had come to submit some poetical pieces to his revision. It is wonderful what a number and variety of writers, some of them even unknown to him, prevailed on his good-nature to look over their works, and suggest corrections and improvements. My arrival interrupted for a little while the important business of this true representative of Bayes; upon its being resumed, I found that the subject under immediate consideration was a translation, yet in manuscript, of the <span class="t8">Carmen Seculare</span> of Horace, which had this year been set to musick, and performed as a publick entertainment in London, for the joint benefit of Monsieur Philidor and Signer Baretti. When Johnson had done reading, the authour asked him bluntly, &lsquo;If upon the whole it was a good translation?&rsquo; Johnson, whose regard for truth was uncommonly strict, seemed to be puzzled for a moment, what answer to make; as he certainly could not honestly commend the performance: with exquisite address he evaded the question thus, &lsquo;Sir, I do not say that it may not be made a very good translation.&rsquo; Here nothing whatever in favour of the performance was affirmed, and yet the writer was not shocked. A printed <span class="t8">Ode to the Warlike Genius of Britain</span>, came next in review; the bard&nbsp; was a lank bony figure, with short black hair; he was writhing himself in agitation, while Johnson read, and shewing his teeth in a grin of earnestness, exclaimed in broken sentences, and in a keen sharp tone, &lsquo;Is that poetry, Sir? &mdash; Is it <span class="t8">Pindar</span>?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, there is here a great deal of what is called poetry.&rsquo; Then, turning to me, the poet cried, &lsquo;My muse has not been long upon the town, and (pointing to the <span class="t8">Ode</span>) it trembles under the hand of the great critick.&rsquo; Johnson, in a tone of displeasure, asked him, &lsquo;Why do you praise Anson ?&rsquo; I did not trouble him by asking his reason for this question. He proceeded, &lsquo;Here is an errour, Sir; you have made Genius feminine.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Palpable, Sir; (cried the enthusiast) I know it. But (in a lower tone) it was to pay a compliment to the Duchess of Devonshire, with which her Grace was pleased. She is walking across Coxheath, in the military uniform, and I suppose her to be the Genius of Britain.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, you are giving a reason for it; but that will not make it right. You may have a reason why two and two should make five; but they will still make but four.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Although I was several times with him in the course of the following days, such it seems were my occupations, or such my negligence, that I have preserved no memorial of his conversation till Friday, March 26, when I visited him. He said he expected to be attacked on account of his <span class="t8">Lives of the Poets</span>. &lsquo;However (said he) I would rather be attacked than unnoticed. For the worst thing you can do to an authour is to be silent as to his works.. An assault upon a town is a bad thing; but starving it is still worse; an assault may be unsuccessful; you may have more men killed than you kill; but if you starve the town, you are sure of victory.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Talking of a friend of ours associating with persons of very discordant principles and characters; I said he was a very universal man, quite a man of the world. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Yes, Sir; but one may be so much a man of the world as to be nothing in the world. I remember a passage in Goldsmith&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Vicar of Wakefield</span>, which he was afterwards fool enough to expunge: &ldquo;I do not love a man who is zealous for nothing.&rdquo;&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;That was a fine passage.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Yes, Sir: there was another fine passage too, which he struck out: &ldquo;When I was a young man, being anxious to distinguish myself, I was perpetually starting new propositions. But I soon gave this over; for, I found that generally what was new was false.&rdquo;&rsquo; I said I did not like to sit with people of whom I had not a good opinion. JOHNSON. &lsquo;But you must not indulge your delicacy too much; or you will be a <span class="t8">tête-à-tête</span> man all your life.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">During my stay in London this spring, I find I was unaccountably negligent in preserving Johnson&rsquo;s sayings, more so than at any time when I was happy enough to have an opportunity of hearing his wisdom and wit. There is no help for it now. I must content myself with presenting such scraps as I have. But I am nevertheless ashamed and vexed to think how much has been lost. It is not that there was a bad crop this year; but that I was not sufficiently careful in gathering it in. I, therefore, in some instances can only exhibit a few detached fragments.</p>
<p class="p24">Talking of the wonderful concealment of the authour of the celebrated letters signed <span class="t8">Junius</span>; he said, &lsquo;I should have believed Burke to be Junius, because I know no man but Burke who is capable of writing these letters; but Burke spontaneously denied it to me. The case would have been different had I asked him if he was the authour; a man so questioned, as to an anonymous publication, may think he has a right to deny it.&rsquo;.</p>
<p class="p24">He observed that his old friend, Mr. Sheridan, had been honoured with extraordinary attention in his own country, by having had an exception made in his favour in an Irish Act of Parliament concerning insolvent debtors. &lsquo;Thus to be singled out (said he) by a legislature, as an object of publick consideration and kindness, is a proof of no common merit.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">At Streatham, on Monday, March 29, at breakfast he maintained that a father had no right to control the inclinations of his daughters in marriage.</p>
<p class="p24">On Wednesday, March 31, when I visited him, and confessed an excess of which I had very seldom been guilty; that I had spent a whole night in playing at cards, and that I could not look back on it with satisfaction; instead of a harsh animadversion, he mildly said, &lsquo;Alas, Sir, on how few things can we look back with satisfaction.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Thursday, April 1, he commended one of the Dukes of Devonshire for &lsquo;a dogged veracity.&rsquo; He said too, &lsquo;London is nothing to some people; but to a man whose pleasure is intellectual, London is the place. And there is no place where oeconomy can be so well practised as in London. More can be had here for the money, even by ladies, than any where else. You cannot play tricks with your fortune in a small place; you must make an uniform appearance. Here a lady may have well-furnished apartments, and elegant dress, without any meat in her kitchen.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I was amused by considering with how much ease and coolness he could write or talk to a friend, exhorting him not to suppose that happiness was not to be found as well in other places as in London; when he himself was at all times sensible of its being, comparatively speaking, a heaven upon earth. The truth is, that by those who from sagacity, attention, and experience, have learnt the full advantage of London, its preeminence over every other place, not only for variety of enjoyment, but for comfort, will be felt with a philosophical exultation. The freedom from remark and petty censure, with which life may be passed there, is a circumstance which a man who knows the teazing restraint of a narrow circle must relish highly. Mr. Burke, whose orderly and amiable domestic habits might make the eye of observation less irksome to him than to most men, said once very pleasantly, in my hearing, &lsquo;Though I have the honour to represent Bristol, I should not like to live there; I should be obliged to be so much <span class="t8">upon my good behaviour</span>.&rsquo; In London, a man may live in splendid society at one time, and in frugal retirement at another, without animadversion. There, and there alone, a man&rsquo;s own house is truly his <span class="t8">castle</span>, in which he can be in perfect safety from intrusion whenever he pleases. I never shall forget how well this was expressed to me one day by Mr. Meynell: &lsquo;The chief advantage of London (said he) is, that a man is always <span class="t8">so near his burrow</span>.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He said of one of his old acquaintances, &lsquo;He is very fit for a travelling governour. He knows French very well. He is a man of good principles; and there would be no danger that a young gentleman should catch his manner; for it is so very bad, that it must be avoided. In that respect he would be like the drunken Helot.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">A gentleman has informed me, that Johnson said of the same person, &lsquo;Sir, he has the most <span class="t8">inverted</span> understanding of any man whom I have ever known.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Friday, April 2, being Good-Friday, I visited him in the morning as usual; and finding that we insensibly fell into a train of ridicule upon the foibles of one of our friends, a very worthy man, I, by way of a check, quoted some good admonition from <span class="t8">The Government of the Tongue</span>, that very pious book. It happened also remarkably enough, that the subject of the sermon preached to us to-day by Dr. Burrows, the rector of St. Clement Danes, was the certainty that at the last day we must give an account of &lsquo;the deeds done in the body;&rsquo; and, amongst various acts of culpability he mentioned evil-speaking. As we were moving slowly along in the crowd from church, Johnson jogged my elbow, and said, &lsquo;Did you attend to the sermon?&rsquo; &lsquo;Yes, Sir, (said I,) it was very applicable to <span class="t8">us</span>.&rsquo; He, however, stood upon the defensive. &lsquo;Why, Sir, the sense of ridicule is given us, and may be lawfully used. The authour of <span class="t8">The Government of the Tongue</span> would have us treat all men alike.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">In the interval between morning and evening service, he endeavoured to employ himself earnestly in devotional exercises; and as he has mentioned in his <span class="t8">Prayers and Meditations</span>, gave me &lsquo;<span class="t8">Les Pensées de Paschal</span>&rsquo;, that I might not interrupt him. I preserve the book with reverence. His presenting it to me is marked upon it with his own hand, and I have found in it a truly divine unction. We went to church again in the afternoon.</p>
<p class="p24">On Saturday, April 3, I visited him at night, and found him sitting in Mrs. Williams&rsquo;s room, with her, and one who he afterwards told me was a natural son of the second Lord Southwell. The table had a singular appearance, being covered with a heterogeneous assemblage of oysters and porter for his company, and tea for himself. I mentioned my having heard an eminent physician, who was himself a Christian, argue in favour of universal toleration, and maintain, that no man could be hurt by another man&rsquo;s differing from him in opinion. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, you are to a certain degree hurt by knowing that even one man does not believe.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Easter-day, after solemn service at St. Paul&rsquo;s, I dined with him: Mr. Allen the printer was also his guest. He was uncommonly silent; and I have not written down any thing, except a single curious fact, which, having the sanction of his inflexible veracity, may be received as a striking instance of human insensibility and inconsideration. As he was passing by a fishmonger who was skinning an eel alive, he heard him &lsquo;curse it, because it would not lye still.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Wednesday, April 7, I dined with him at Sir Joshua Reynolds&rsquo;s. I have not marked what company was there. Johnson harangued upon the qualities of different liquors; and spoke with great contempt of claret, as so weak, that &lsquo;a man would be drowned by it before it made him drunk.&rsquo; He was persuaded to drink one glass of it, that he might judge, not from recollection, which might be dim, but from immediate sensation. He shook his head, and said, &lsquo;Poor stuff! No, Sir, claret is the liquor for boys; port for men; but he who aspires to be a hero (smiling) must drink brandy. In the first place, the flavour of brandy is most grateful to the palate; and then brandy will do soonest for a man what drinking <span class="t8">can</span> do for him. There are, indeed, few who are able to drink brandy. That is a power rather to be wished for than attained. And yet, (proceeded he) as in all pleasure hope is a considerable part, I know not but fruition comes too quick by brandy. Florence wine I think the worst; it is wine only to the eye; it is wine neither while you are drinking it, nor after you have drunk it; it neither pleases the taste, nor exhilarates the spirits.&rsquo; I reminded him how heartily he and I used to drink wine together, when we were first acquainted; and how I used to have a head-ache after sitting up with him. He did not like to have this recalled, or, perhaps, thinking that I boasted improperly, resolved to have a witty stroke at me: &lsquo;Nay, Sir, it was not the <span class="t8">wine</span> that made your head ache, but the <span class="t8">sense</span> that I put into it.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;What, Sir! will sense make the head ache?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Yes, Sir, (with a smile) when it is not used to it.&rsquo; &mdash; No man who has a true relish of pleasantry could be offended at this; especially if Johnson in a long intimacy had given him repeated proofs of his regard and good estimation. I used to say, that as he had given me a thousand pounds in praise, he had a good right now and then to take a guinea from me.</p>
<p class="p24">On Thursday, April 8, I dined with him at Mr. Allan Ramsay&rsquo;s, with Lord Graham and some other company. We talked of Shakspeare&rsquo;s witches. JOHNSON. &lsquo;They are beings of his own creation; they are a compound of malignity and meanness, without any abilities; and are quite different from the Italian magician. King James says in his <span class="t8">Daemonology</span>, &lsquo;Magicians command the devils: witches are their servants. The Italian magicians are elegant beings.&rsquo; RAMSAY. &lsquo;Opera witches, not Drury-lane witches.&rsquo; Johnson observed, that abilities might be employed in a narrow sphere, as in getting money, which he said he believed no man could do, without vigorous parts, though concentrated to a point. RAMSAY. &lsquo;Yes, like a strong horse in a mill; he pulls better.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Lord Graham, while he praised the beauty of Lochlomond, on the banks of which is his family seat, complained of the climate, and said he could not bear it. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Nay, my Lord, don&rsquo;t talk so: you may bear it well enough. Your ancestors have borne it more years than I can tell.&rsquo; This was a handsome compliment to the antiquity of the House of Montrose. His Lordship told me afterwards, that he had only affected to complain of the climate; lest, if he had spoken as favourably of his country as he really thought, Dr. Johnson might have attacked it. Johnson was very courteous to Lady Margaret Macdonald. &lsquo;Madam, (said he,) when I was in the Isle of Sky, I heard of the people running to take the stones off the road, lest Lady Margaret&rsquo;s horse should stumble.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Lord Graham commended Dr. Drummond at Naples, as a man of extraordinary talents; and added, that he had a great love of liberty. JOHNSON. &lsquo;He is <span class="t8">young</span>, my Lord; (looking to his Lordship with an arch smile) all <span class="t8">boys</span> love liberty, till experience convinces them they are not so fit to govern themselves as they imagined. We are all agreed as to our own liberty; we would have as much of it as we can get; but we are not agreed as to the liberty of others: for in proportion as we take, others must lose. I believe we hardly wish that the mob should have liberty to govern us. When that was the case some time ago, no man was at liberty not to have candles in his windows.&rsquo; RAMSAY. &lsquo;The result is, that order is better than confusion.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;The result is, that order cannot be had but by subordination.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Friday, April 16, I had been present at the trial of the unfortunate Mr. Hackman, who, in a fit of frantick jealous love, had shot Miss Ray, the favourite of a nobleman. Johnson, in whose company I dined to-day with some other friends, was much interested by my account of what passed, and particularly with his prayer for the mercy of heaven. He said, in a solemn fervid tone, &lsquo;I hope he <span class="t8">shall</span> find mercy.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">This day a violent altercation arose between Johnson and Beauclerk, which having made much noise at the time, I think it proper, in order to prevent any future misrepresentation, to give a minute account of it.</p>
<p class="p24">In talking of Hackman, Johnson argued, as Judge Blackstone had done, that his being furnished with two pistols was a proof that he meant to shoot two persons. Mr. Beauclerk said, &lsquo;No; for that every wise man who intended to shoot himself, took two pistols, that he might be sure of doing it at once. Lord &mdash; &mdash; &lsquo;s cook shot himself with one pistol, and lived ten days in great agony. Mr. &mdash;&mdash; , who loved buttered muffins, but durst not eat them because they disagreed with his stomach, resolved to shoot himself; and then he eat three buttered muffins for breakfast, before shooting himself, knowing that he should not be troubled with indigestion: <span class="t8">he</span> had two charged pistols; one was found lying charged upon the table by him, after he had shot himself with the other.&rsquo; &lsquo;Well, (said Johnson, with an air of triumph,) you see here one pistol was sufficient.&rsquo; Beauclerk replied smartly, &lsquo;Because it happened to kill him.&rsquo; And either then or a very little afterwards, being piqued at Johnson&rsquo;s triumphant remark, added, &lsquo;This is what you don&rsquo;t know, and I do.&rsquo; There was then a cessation of the dispute; and some minutes intervened, during which, dinner and the glass went on cheerfully; when Johnson suddenly and abruptly exclaimed, &lsquo;Mr. Beauclerk, how came you to talk so petulantly to me, as &ldquo;This is what you don&rsquo;t know, but what I know&rdquo;? One thing <span class="t8">I</span> know, which <span class="t8">you</span> don&rsquo;t seem to know, that you are very uncivil.&rsquo; BEAUCLERK. &lsquo;Because you began by being uncivil, (which you always are.)&rsquo; The words in parenthesis were, I believe, not heard by Dr. Johnson. Here again there was a cessation of arms. Johnson told me, that the reason why he waited at first some time without taking any notice of what Mr. Beauclerk said, was because he was thinking whether he should resent it. But when he considered that there were present a young Lord and an eminent traveller, two men of the world with whom he had never dined before, he was apprehensive that they might think they had a right to take such liberties with him as Beauclerk did, and therefore resolved he would not let it pass; adding, that &lsquo;he would not appear a coward.&rsquo; A little while after this, the conversation turned on the violence of Hackman&rsquo;s temper. Johnson then said, &lsquo;It was his business to <span class="t8">command</span> his temper, as my friend, Mr. Beauclerk, should have done some time ago.&rsquo; BEAUCLERK. &lsquo;I should learn of <span class="t8">you</span>, Sir.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, you have given <span class="t8">me</span> opportunities enough of learning, when I have been in <span class="t8">your</span> company. No man loves to be treated with contempt.&rsquo; BEAUCLERK. (with a polite inclination towards Johnson) &lsquo;Sir, you have known me twenty years, and however I may have treated others, you may be sure I could never treat you with contempt&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, you have said more than was necessary.&rsquo; Thus it ended; and Beauclerk&rsquo;s coach not having come for him till very late, Dr. Johnson and another gentleman sat with him a long time after the rest of the company were gone; and he and I dined at Beauclerk&rsquo;s on the Saturday se&rsquo;nnight following.</p>
<p class="p24">After this tempest had subsided, I recollect the following particulars of his conversation: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am always for getting a boy forward in his learning; for that is a sure good. I would let him at first read <span class="t8">any</span> English book which happens to engage his attention; because you have done a great deal when you have brought him to have entertainment from a book. He&rsquo;ll get better books afterwards.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Mallet, I believe, never wrote a single line of his projected life of the Duke of Marlborough. He groped for materials; and thought of it, till he had exhausted his mind. Thus it sometimes happens that men entangle themselves in their own schemes.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To be contradicted, in order to force you to talk, is mighty unpleasing. You <span class="t8">shine</span>, indeed; but it is by being <span class="t8">ground</span>.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Of a gentleman who made some figure among the <span class="t8">Literati</span> of his time, (Mr. Fitzherbert,) he said, &lsquo;What eminence he had was by a felicity of manner; he had no more learning than what he could not help.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Saturday, April 24, I dined with him at Mr. Beauclerk&rsquo;s, with Sir Joshua Reynolds, Mr. Jones, (afterwards Sir William,) Mr. Langton, Mr. Steevens, Mr. Paradise, and Dr. Higgins. I mentioned that Mr. Wilkes had attacked Garrick to me, as a man who had no friend. &lsquo;I believe he is right, Sir. [Greek: <span class="t8">Oi philoi, ou philos</span>] &mdash; He had friends, but no friend. Garrick was so diffused, he had no man to whom he wished to unbosom himself. He found people always ready to applaud him, and that always for the same thing: so he saw life with great uniformity.&rsquo; I took upon me, for once, to fight with Goliath&rsquo;s weapons, and play the sophist.&mdash; &lsquo;Garrick did not need a friend, as he got from every body all he wanted. What is a friend? One who supports you and comforts you, while others do not. Friendship, you know, Sir, is the cordial drop, &ldquo;to make the nauseous draught of life go down:&rdquo; but if the draught be not nauseous, if it be all sweet, there is no occasion for that drop.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Many men would not be content to live so. I hope I should not. They would wish to have an intimate friend, with whom they might compare minds, and cherish private virtues.&rsquo; One of the company mentioned Lord Chesterfield, as a man who had no friend. JOHNSON. &lsquo;There were more materials to make friendship in Garrick, had he not been so diffused.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Garrick was pure gold, but beat out to thin leaf. Lord Chesterfield was tinsel.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Garrick was a very good man, the cheerfullest man of his age; a decent liver in a profession which is supposed to give indulgence to licentiousness; and a man who gave away, freely, money acquired by himself. He began the world with a great hunger for money; the son of a half-pay officer, bred in a family, whose study was to make four-pence do as much as others made four-pence halfpenny do. But, when he had got money, he was very liberal.&rsquo; I presumed to animadvert on his eulogy on Garrick, in his <span class="t8">Lives of the Poets</span>. &lsquo;You say, Sir, his death eclipsed the gaiety of nations.&rsquo;&nbsp; JOHNSON. &lsquo;I could not have said more nor less. It is the truth; <span class="t8">eclipsed</span>, not <span class="t8">extinguished</span>; and his death <span class="t8">did</span> eclipse; it was like a storm.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;But why nations? Did his gaiety extend farther than his own nation?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, some exaggeration must be allowed. Besides, nations may be said &mdash; if we allow the Scotch to be a nation, and to have gaiety, &mdash; which they have not. <span class="t8">You</span> are an exception, though. Come, gentlemen, let us candidly admit that there is one Scotchman who is cheerful.&rsquo; BEAUCLERK. &lsquo;But he is a very unnatural Scotchman.&rsquo; I, however, continued to think the compliment to Garrick hyperbolically untrue. His acting had ceased some time before his death; at any rate he had acted in Ireland but a short time, at an early period of his life, and never in Scotland. I objected also to what appears an anticlimax of praise, when contrasted with the preceding panegyrick,&mdash; &lsquo;and diminished the public stock of harmless pleasure!&rsquo;&mdash; &lsquo;Is not harmless pleasure very tame?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Nay, Sir, harmless pleasure is the highest praise. Pleasure is a word of dubious import; pleasure is in general dangerous, and pernicious to virtue; to be able therefore to furnish pleasure that is harmless, pleasure pure and unalloyed, is as great a power as man can possess.&rsquo; This was, perhaps, as ingenious a defence as could be made; still, however, I was not satisfied.</p>
<p class="p24">A celebrated wit being mentioned, he said, &lsquo;One may say of him as was said of a French wit, <span class="t8">Il n&rsquo;a de l&rsquo;esprit que contre Dieu</span>. I have been several times in company with him, but never perceived any strong power of wit. He produces a general effect by various means; he has a cheerful countenance and a gay voice. Besides his trade is wit. It would be as wild in him to come into company without merriment, as for a highwayman to take the road without his pistols.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Talking of the effects of drinking, he said, &lsquo;Drinking may be practised with great prudence; a man who exposes himself when he is intoxicated, has not the art of getting drunk; a sober man who happens occasionally to get drunk, readily enough goes into a new company, which a man who has been drinking should never do. Such a man will undertake any thing; he is without skill in inebriation. I used to slink home, when I had drunk too much. A man accustomed to self-examination will be conscious when he is drunk, though an habitual drunkard will not be conscious of it. I knew a physician who for twenty years was not sober; yet in a pamphlet, which he wrote upon fevers, he appealed to Garrick and me for his vindication from a charge of drunkenness. A bookseller (naming him) who got a large fortune by trade, was so habitually and equably drunk, that his most intimate friends never perceived that he was more sober at one time than another.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Talking of celebrated and successful irregular practisers in physick; he said, &lsquo;Taylor was the most ignorant man I ever knew; but sprightly. Ward the dullest. Taylor challenged me once to talk Latin with him; (laughing). I quoted some of Horace, which he took to be a part of my own speech. He said a few words well enough.&rsquo; BEAUCLERK. &lsquo;I remember, Sir, you said that Taylor was an instance how far impudence could carry ignorance.&rsquo; Mr. Beauclerk was very entertaining this day, and told us a number of short stories in a lively elegant manner, and with that air of <span class="t8">the world</span> which has I know not what impressive effect, as if there were something more than is expressed, or than perhaps we could perfectly understand. As Johnson and I accompanied Sir Joshua Reynolds in his coach, Johnson said, &lsquo;There is in Beauclerk a predominance over his company, that one does not like. But he is a man who has lived so much in the world, that he has a short story on every occasion; he is always ready to talk, and is never exhausted.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson and I passed the evening at Miss Reynolds&rsquo;s, Sir Joshua&rsquo;s sister. I mentioned that an eminent friend of ours, talking of the common remark, that affection descends, said, that &lsquo;this was wisely contrived for the preservation of mankind; for which it was not so necessary that there should be affection from children to parents, as from parents to children; nay, there would be no harm in that view though children should at a certain age eat their parents.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;But, Sir, if this were known generally to be the case, parents would not have affection for children.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;True, Sir; for it is in expectation of a return that parents are so attentive to their children; and I know a very pretty instance of a little girl of whom her father was very fond, who once when he was in a melancholy fit, and had gone to bed, persuaded him to rise in good humour by saying, &ldquo;My dear papa, please to get up, and let me help you on with your clothes, that I may learn to do it when you are an old man.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Soon after this time a little incident occurred, which I will not suppress, because I am desirous that my work should be, as much as is consistent with the strictest truth, an antidote to the false and injurious notions of his character, which have been given by others, and therefore I infuse every drop of genuine sweetness into my biographical cup.</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">&lsquo;TO DR. JOHNSON.</span></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">&lsquo;MY DEAR SIR,</span></p>
<p class="p21">&lsquo;I am in great pain with an inflamed foot, and obliged to keep my bed, so am prevented from having the pleasure to dine at Mr. Ramsay&rsquo;s to-day, which is very hard; and my spirits are sadly sunk. Will you be so friendly as to come and sit an hour with me in the evening.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am ever</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your most faithful,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;And affectionate humble servant,</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;JAMES BOSWELL.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;South Audley-street,<br/>Monday, April 26.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">&lsquo;TO MR. BOSWELL.</span></p>
<p class="p21">&lsquo;Mr. Johnson laments the absence of Mr. Boswell, and will come to him.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Harley-street.</p>
<p class="p24">He came to me in the evening, and brought Sir Joshua Reynolds. I need scarcely say, that their conversation, while they sat by my bedside, was the most pleasing opiate to pain that could have been administered.</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson being now better disposed to obtain information concerning Pope than he was last year, sent by me to my Lord Marchmont a present of those volumes of his <span class="t8">Lives of the Poets</span> which were at this time published, with a request to have permission to wait on him; and his Lordship, who had called on him twice, obligingly appointed Saturday, the first of May, for receiving us.</p>
<p class="p24">On that morning Johnson came to me from Streatham, and after drinking chocolate, at General Paoli&rsquo;s, in South-Audley-street, we proceeded to Lord Marchmont&rsquo;s in Curzon-street. His Lordship met us at the door of his library, and with great politeness said to Johnson, &lsquo;I am not going to make an encomium upon <span class="t8">myself</span>, by telling you the high respect I have for <span class="t8">you</span>, Sir.&rsquo; Johnson was exceedingly courteous; and the interview, which lasted about two hours, during which the Earl communicated his anecdotes of Pope, was as agreeable as I could have wished. When we came out, I said to Johnson, that considering his Lordship&rsquo;s civility, I should have been vexed if he had again failed to come. &lsquo;Sir, (said he,) I would rather have given twenty pounds than not have come.&rsquo; I accompanied him to Streatham, where we dined, and returned to town in the evening.</p>
<p class="p24">On Monday, May 3, I dined with him at Mr. Dilly&rsquo;s; I pressed him this day for his opinion on the passage in Parnell, concerning which I had in vain questioned him in several letters, and at length obtained it in <span class="t8">due form of law</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">CASE for Dr. JOHNSON&rsquo;S Opinion; 3rd of May, 1779.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;PARNELL, in his <span class="t8">Hermit</span>, has the following passage:</p>
<p class="p26">&ldquo;To clear this doubt, to know the world by sight,<br/>To find if <span class="t8">books</span> and <span class="t8">swains</span> report it right:<br/>(For yet by <span class="t8">swains alone</span> the world he knew,<br/>Whose feet came wand&rsquo;ring o&rsquo;er the nightly dew.)&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Is there not a contradiction in its being <span class="t8">first</span> supposed that the <span class="t8">Hermit</span> knew <span class="t8">both</span> what books and swains reported of the world; yet <span class="t8">afterwards</span> said, that he knew it by swains <span class="t8">alone</span>?&rsquo; &lsquo;I think it an inaccuracy. &mdash; He mentions two instructors in the first line, and says he had only one in the next..&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">This evening I set out for Scotland.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To MRS. LUCY PORTER, IN LICHFIELD.</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">&lsquo;DEAR MADAM,</span></p>
<p class="p21">&lsquo;Mr. Green has informed me that you are much better; I hope I need not tell you that I am glad of it. I cannot boast of being much better; my old nocturnal complaint still pursues me, and my respiration is difficult, though much easier than when I left you the summer before last. Mr. and Mrs. Thrale are well; Miss has been a little indisposed; but she is got well again. They have since the loss of their boy had two daughters; but they seem likely to want a son.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I hope you had some books which I sent you. I was sorry for poor Mrs. Adey&rsquo;s death, and am afraid you will be sometimes solitary; but endeavour, whether alone or in company, to keep yourself cheerful. My friends likewise die very fast; but such is the state of man.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am, dear love,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your most humble servant,</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;May 4, 1779.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He had, before I left London, resumed the conversation concerning the appearance of a ghost at Newcastle upon Tyne, which Mr. John Wesley believed, but to which Johnson did not give credit. I was, however, desirous to examine the question closely, and at the same time wished to be made acquainted with Mr. John Wesley; for though I differed from him in some points, I admired his various talents, and loved his pious zeal. At my request, therefore, Dr. Johnson gave me a letter of introduction to him.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To THE REVEREND MR. JOHN WESLEY.</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">SIR,</span></p>
<p class="p21">Mr. Boswell, a gentleman who has been long known to me, is desirous of being known to you, and has asked this recommendation, which I give him with great willingness, because I think it very much to be wished that worthy and religious men should be acquainted with each other.</p>
<p class="p24">I am, Sir,</p>
<p class="p26">Your most humble servant,<br/>&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;<br/>May 3, 1779.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Mr. Wesley being in the course of his ministry at Edinburgh, I presented this letter to him, and was very politely received. I begged to have it returned to me, which was accordingly done. His state of the evidence as to the ghost did not satisfy me. I did not write to Johnson, as usual, upon my return to my family, but tried how he would be affected by my silence. Mr. Dilly sent me a copy of a note which he received from him on the 13th of July, in these words: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">&lsquo;TO MR. DILLY.</span></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">SIR,</span></p>
<p class="p21">Since Mr. Boswell&rsquo;s departure I have never heard from him; please to send word what you know of him, and whether you have sent my books to his lady. I am, &amp;c.,</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">My readers will not doubt that his solicitude about me was very flattering.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To JAMES BOSWELL, ESQ.</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;What can possibly have happened, that keeps us two such strangers to each other? I expected to have heard from you when you came home; I expected afterwards. I went into the country and returned; and yet there is no letter from Mr. Boswell. No ill I hope has happened; and if ill should happen, why should it be concealed from him who loves you? Is it a fit of humour, that has disposed you to try who can hold out longest without writing? If it be, you have the victory. But I am afraid of something bad; set me free from my suspicions.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;My thoughts are at present employed in guessing the reason of your silence: you must not expect that I should tell you any thing, if I had any thing to tell. Write, pray write to me, and let me know what is, or what has been the cause of this long interruption.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am, dear Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your most affectionate humble servant,</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;July 13, 1779.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To DR. SAMUEL JOHNSON.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Edinburgh, July 17, 1779.</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">&lsquo;MY DEAR SIR,</span></p>
<p class="p21">&lsquo;What may be justly denominated a supine indolence of mind has been my state of existence since I last returned to Scotland. In a livelier state I had often suffered severely from long intervals of silence on your part; and I had even been chided by you for expressing my uneasiness. I was willing to take advantage of my insensibility, and while I could bear the experiment, to try whether your affection for me would, after an unusual silence on my part, make you write first. This afternoon I have had very high satisfaction by receiving your kind letter of inquiry, for which I most gratefully thank you. I am doubtful if it was right to make the experiment; though I have gained by it. I was beginning to grow tender, and to upbraid myself, especially after having dreamt two nights ago that I was with you. I and my wife, and my four children, are all well. I would not delay one post to answer your letter; but as it is late, I have not time to do more. You shall soon hear from me, upon many and various particulars; and I shall never again put you to any test.</p>
<p class="p24">I am, with veneration, my dear Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your much obliged,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;And faithful humble servant,</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;JAMES BOSWELL.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On the 22nd of July, I wrote to him again; and gave him an account of my last interview with my worthy friend, Mr. Edward Dilly, at his brother&rsquo;s house at Southill, in Bedfordshire, where he died soon after I parted from him, leaving me a very kind remembrance of his regard.</p>
<p class="p24">I informed him that Lord Hailes, who had promised to furnish him with some anecdotes for his <span class="t8">Lives of the Poets</span>, had sent me three instances of Prior&rsquo;s borrowing from <span class="t8">Gombauld</span>, in <span class="t8">Recueil des Poetes</span>, tome 3. Epigram <span class="t8">To John I owed &lsquo;great obligation</span>,&rsquo; p. 25. <span class="t8">To the Duke of Noailles</span>, p. 32. <span class="t8">Sauntering Jack and Idle Joan</span>, p. 25.</p>
<p class="p24">My letter was a pretty long one, and contained a variety of particulars; but he, it should seem, had not attended to it; for his next to me was as follows: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To JAMES BOSWELL, ESQ.</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">&lsquo;MY DEAR SIR,</span></p>
<p class="p21">&lsquo;Are you playing the same trick again, and trying who can keep silence longest? Remember that all tricks are either knavish or childish; and that it is as foolish to make experiments upon the constancy of a friend, as upon the chastity of a wife.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;What can be the cause of this second fit of silence, I cannot conjecture; but after one trick, I will not be cheated by another, nor will harass my thoughts with conjectures about the motives of a man who, probably, acts only by caprice. I therefore suppose you are well, and that Mrs. Boswell is well too; and that the fine summer has restored Lord Auchinleck. I am much better than you left me; I think I am better than when I was in Scotland.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I forgot whether I informed you that poor Thrale has been in great danger. Mrs. Thrale likewise has miscarried, and been much indisposed. Every body else is well; Langton is in camp. I intend to put Lord Hailes&rsquo;s description of Dryden into another edition, and as I know his accuracy, wish he would consider the dates, which I could not always settle to my own mind.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Mr. Thrale goes to Brighthelmston, about Michaelmas, to be jolly and ride a hunting. I shall go to town, or perhaps to Oxford. Exercise and gaiety, or rather carelessness, will, I hope, dissipate all remains of his malady; and I likewise hope by the change of place, to find some opportunities of growing yet better myself. I am, dear Sir,</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;Your humble servant,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Streatham, Sept. 9, 1779.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">My readers will not be displeased at being told every slight circumstance of the manner in which Dr. Johnson contrived to amuse his solitary hours. He sometimes employed himself in chymistry, sometimes in watering and pruning a vine, sometimes in small experiments, at which those who may smile, should recollect that there are moments which admit of being soothed only by trifles.</p>
<p class="p24">On the 20th of September I defended myself against his suspicion of me, which I did not deserve; and added, &lsquo;Pray let us write frequently. A whim strikes me, that we should send off a sheet once a week, like a stage-coach, whether it be full or not; nay, though it should be empty. The very sight of your handwriting would comfort me; and were a sheet to be thus sent regularly, we should much oftener convey something, were it only a few kind words.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">My friend Colonel James Stuart, second son of the Earl of Bute, who had distinguished himself as a good officer of the Bedfordshire militia, had taken a publick-spirited resolution to serve his country in its difficulties, by raising a regular regiment, and taking the command of it himself. This, in the heir of the immense property of Wortley, was highly honourable. Having been in Scotland recruiting, he obligingly asked me to accompany him to Leeds, then the head-quarters of his corps; from thence to London for a short time, and afterwards to other places to which the regiment might be ordered. Such an offer, at a time of the year when I had full leisure, was very pleasing; especially as I was to accompany a man of sterling good sense, information, discernment, and conviviality; and was to have a second crop in one year of London and Johnson. Of this I informed my illustrious friend, in characteristical warm terms, in a letter dated the 30th of September, from Leeds.</p>
<p class="p24">On Monday, October 4, I called at his house before he was up. He sent for me to his bedside, and expressed his satisfaction at this incidental meeting, with as much vivacity as if he had been in the gaiety of youth. He called briskly, &lsquo;Frank, go and get coffee, and let us breakfast <span class="t8">in splendour</span>.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">During this visit to London I had several interviews with him, which it is unnecessary to distinguish particularly. I consulted him as to the appointment of guardians to my children, in case of my death. &lsquo;Sir, (said he,) do not appoint a number of guardians. When there are many, they trust one to another, and the business is neglected. I would advise you to choose only one; let him be a man of respectable character, who, for his own credit, will do what is right; let him be a rich man, so that he may be under no temptation to take advantage; and let him be a man of business, who is used to conduct affairs with ability and expertness, to whom, therefore, the execution of the trust will not be burdensome.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Sunday, October 10, we dined together at Mr. Strahan&rsquo;s. The conversation having turned on the prevailing practice of going to the East-Indies in quest of wealth; &mdash; JOHNSON. &lsquo;A man had better have ten thousand pounds at the end of ten years passed in England, than twenty thousand pounds at the end of ten years passed in India, because you must compute what you <span class="t8">give</span> for money; and a man who has lived ten years in India, has given up ten years of social comfort and all those advantages which arise from living in England. The ingenious Mr. Brown, distinguished by the name of Capability Brown, told me, that he was once at the seat of Lord Clive, who had returned from India with great wealth; and that he shewed him at the door of his bed-chamber a large chest, which he said he had once had full of gold; upon which Brown observed, &ldquo;I am glad you can bear it so near your bed-chamber.&rsquo;&rdquo; </p>
<p class="p24">We talked of the state of the poor in London. &mdash; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Saunders Welch, the Justice, who was once High-Constable of Holborn, and had the best opportunities of knowing the state of the poor, told me, that I under-rated the number, when I computed that twenty a week, that is, above a thousand a year, died of hunger; not absolutely of immediate hunger; but of the wasting and other diseases which are the consequences of hunger. This happens only in so large a place as London, where people are not known. What we are told about the great sums got by begging is not true: the trade is overstocked. And, you may depend upon it, there are many who cannot get work. A particular kind of manufacture fails: those who have been used to work at it, can, for some time, work at nothing else. You meet a man begging; you charge him with idleness: he says, &ldquo;I am willing to labour. Will you give me work?&rdquo;&mdash; &ldquo;I cannot.&rdquo;&mdash; &ldquo;Why, then you have no right to charge me with idleness.&rdquo;&rsquo; </p>
<p class="p24">We left Mr. Strahan&rsquo;s at seven, as Johnson had said he intended to go to evening prayers. As we walked along, he complained of a little gout in his toe, and said, &lsquo;I shan&rsquo;t go to prayers to-night; I shall go to-morrow: Whenever I miss church on a Sunday, I resolve to go another day. But I do not always do it.&rsquo; This was a fair exhibition of that vibration between pious resolutions and indolence, which many of us have too often experienced.</p>
<p class="p24">I went home with him, and we had a long quiet conversation.</p>
<p class="p24">I read him a letter from Dr. Hugh Blair concerning Pope, (in writing whose life he was now employed,) which I shall insert as a literary curiosity.</p>
<p class="p27"><span class="t4">&lsquo;TO JAMES BOSWELL, ESQ. </span>&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;In the year 1763, being at London, I was carried by Dr. John Blair, Prebendary of Westminster, to dine at old Lord Bathurst&rsquo;s; where we found the late Mr. Mallet, Sir James Porter, who had been Ambassadour at Constantinople, the late Dr. Macaulay, and two or three more. The conversation turning on Mr. Pope, Lord Bathurst told us, that <span class="t8">The Essay on Man</span> was originally composed by Lord Bolingbroke in prose, and that Mr. Pope did no more than put it into verse: that he had read Lord Bolingbroke&rsquo;s manuscript in his own hand-writing; and remembered well, that he was at a loss whether most to admire the elegance of Lord Bolingbroke&rsquo;s prose, or the beauty of Mr. Pope&rsquo;s verse. When Lord Bathurst told this, Mr. Mallet bade me attend, and remember this remarkable piece of information; as, by the course of Nature, I might survive his Lordship, and be a witness of his having said so. The conversation was indeed too remarkable to be forgotten. A few days after, meeting with you, who were then also in London, you will remember that I mentioned to you what had passed on this subject, as I was much struck with this anecdote. But what ascertains my recollection of it beyond doubt, is that being accustomed to keep a journal of what passed when I was in London, which I wrote out every evening, I find the particulars of the above information, just as I have now given them, distinctly marked; and am thence enabled to fix this conversation to have passed on Friday, the 22d of April, 1763.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I remember also distinctly, (though I have not for this the authority of my journal,) that the conversation going on concerning Mr. Pope, I took notice of a report which had been sometimes propagated that he did not understand Greek. Lord Bathurst said to me, that he knew that to be false; for that part of the <span class="t8">Iliad</span> was translated by Mr. Pope in his house in the country; and that in the mornings when they assembled at breakfast, Mr. Pope used frequently to repeat, with great rapture, the Greek lines which he had been translating, and then to give them his version of them, and to compare them together.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;If these circumstances can be of any use to Dr. Johnson, you have my full liberty to give them to him. I beg you will, at the same time, present to him my most respectful compliments, with best wishes for his success and fame in all his literary undertakings. I am, with great respect, my dearest Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your most affectionate,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;And obliged humble servant,</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">&lsquo;HUGH BLAIR.&rsquo;</span></p>
<p class="p21">&lsquo;Broughton Park,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Sept. 21, 1779.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">JOHNSON. &lsquo;Depend upon it, Sir, this is too strongly stated. Pope may have had from Bolingbroke the philosophick <span class="t8">stamina</span> of his Essay; and admitting this to be true, Lord Bathurst did not intentionally falsify. But the thing is not true in the latitude that Blair seems to imagine; we are sure that the poetical imagery, which makes a great part of the poem, was Pope&rsquo;s own. It is amazing, Sir, what deviations there are from precise truth, in the account which is given of almost every thing. I told Mrs. Thrale, &ldquo;You have so little anxiety about truth, that you never tax your memory with the exact thing.&rdquo; Now what is the use of the memory to truth, if one is careless of exactness? Lord Hailes&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Annals of Scotland</span> are very exact; but they contain mere dry particulars. They are to be considered as a Dictionary. You know such things are there; and may be looked at when you please. Robertson paints; but the misfortune is, you are sure he does not know the people whom he paints; so you cannot suppose a likeness. Characters should never be given by an historian, unless he knew the people whom he describes, or copies from those who knew them.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">BOSWELL. &lsquo;Why, Sir, do people play this trick which I observe now, when I look at your grate, putting the shovel against it to make the fire burn?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;They play the trick, but it does not make the fire burn. <span class="t8">There</span> is a better; (setting the poker perpendicularly up at right angles with the grate.) In days of superstition they thought, as it made a cross with the bars, it would drive away the witch.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">BOSWELL. &lsquo;By associating with you, Sir, I am always getting an accession of wisdom. But perhaps a man, after knowing his own character &mdash; the limited strength of his own mind, should not be desirous of having too much wisdom, considering, <span class="t8">quid valeant humeri</span>, how little he can carry.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, be as wise as you can; let a man be <span class="t8">aliis laetus, sapiens sibi</span>:</p>
<p class="p26">&ldquo;Though pleas&rsquo;d to see the dolphins play,<br/>I mind my compass and my way.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">You may be wise in your study in the morning, and gay in company at a tavern in the evening. Every man is to take care of his own wisdom and his own virtue, without minding too much what others think.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He said, &lsquo;Dodsley first mentioned to me the scheme of an English Dictionary; but I had long thought of it.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;You did not know what you were undertaking.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Yes, Sir, I knew very well what I was undertaking, &mdash; and very well how to do it, &mdash; and have done it very well.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;An excellent climax! and it <span class="t8">has</span> availed you. In your Preface you say, &ldquo;What would it avail me in this gloom of solitude?&rdquo; You have been agreeably mistaken.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">In his <span class="t8">Life of Milton</span> he observes, &lsquo;I cannot but remark a kind of respect, perhaps unconsciously, paid to this great man by his biographers: every house in which he resided is historically mentioned, as if it were an injury to neglect naming any place that he honoured by his presence.&rsquo; I had, before I read this observation, been desirous of shewing that respect to Johnson, by various inquiries. Finding him this evening in a very good humour, I prevailed on him to give me an exact list of his places of residence, since he entered the metropolis as an authour, which I subjoin in a note.</p>
<p class="p24">I mentioned to him a dispute between a friend of mine and his lady, concerning conjugal infidelity, which my friend had maintained was by no means so bad in the husband, as in the wife. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Your friend was in the right, Sir. Between a man and his Maker it is a different question: but between a man and his wife, a husband&rsquo;s infidelity is nothing. They are connected by children, by fortune, by serious considerations of community. Wise married women don&rsquo;t trouble themselves about the infidelity in their husbands.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;To be sure there is a great difference between the offence of infidelity in a man and that of his wife.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;The difference is boundless. The man imposes no bastards upon his wife.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Here it may be questioned whether Johnson was entirely in the right. I suppose it will not be controverted that the difference in the degree of criminality is very great, on account of consequences: but still it may be maintained, that, independent of moral obligation, infidelity is by no means a light offence in a husband; because it must hurt a delicate attachment, in which a mutual constancy is implied, with such refined sentiments as Massinger has exhibited in his play of <span class="t8">The Picture</span>. &mdash; Johnson probably at another time would have admitted this opinion. And let it be kept in remembrance, that he was very careful not to give any encouragement to irregular conduct. A gentleman, not adverting to the distinction made by him upon this subject, supposed a case of singular perverseness in a wife, and heedlessly said, &lsquo;That then he thought a husband might do as he pleased with a safe conscience.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Nay, Sir, this is wild indeed (smiling) you must consider that fornication is a crime in a single man; and you cannot have more liberty by being married.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He this evening expressed himself strongly against the Roman Catholics; observing, &lsquo;In every thing in which they differ from us they are wrong.&rsquo; He was even against the invocation of saints; in short, he was in the humour of opposition.</p>
<p class="p24">Having regretted to him that I had learnt little Greek, as is too generally the case in Scotland; that I had for a long time hardly applied at all to the study of that noble language, and that I was desirous of being told by him what method to follow; he recommended to me as easy helps, Sylvanus&rsquo;s <span class="t8">First Book of the Iliad</span>; Dawson&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Lexicon to the Greek New Testament</span>; and <span class="t8">Hesiod</span>, with <span class="t8">Pasoris Lexicon</span> at the end of it.</p>
<p class="p24">On Tuesday, October 13, I dined with him at Mr. Ramsay&rsquo;s, with Lord Newhaven, and some other company, none of whom I recollect, but a beautiful Miss Graham, a relation of his Lordship&rsquo;s, who asked Dr. Johnson to hob or nob with her. He was flattered by such pleasing attention, and politely told her, he never drank wine; but if she would drink a glass of water, he was much at her service. She accepted. &lsquo;Oho, Sir! (said Lord Newhaven) you are caught.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Nay, I do not see <span class="t8">how</span> I am <span class="t8">caught</span>; but if I am caught, I don&rsquo;t want to get free again. If I am caught, I hope to be kept.&rsquo; Then when the two glasses of water were brought, smiling placidly to the young lady, he said, &lsquo;Madam, let us <span class="t8">reciprocate</span>.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Lord Newhaven and Johnson carried on an argument for some time, concerning the Middlesex election. Johnson said, &lsquo;Parliament may be considered as bound by law as a man is bound where there is nobody to tie the knot. As it is clear that the House of Commons may expel, and expel again and again, why not allow of the power to incapacitate for that parliament, rather than have a perpetual contest kept up between parliament and the people.&rsquo; Lord Newhaven took the opposite side; but respectfully said, &lsquo;I speak with great deference to you, Dr. Johnson; I speak to be instructed.&rsquo; This had its full effect on my friend. He bowed his head almost as low as the table, to a complimenting nobleman; and called out, &lsquo;My Lord, my Lord, I do not desire all this ceremony; let us tell our minds to one another quietly.&rsquo; After the debate was over, he said, &lsquo;I have got lights on the subject to-day, which I had not before.&rsquo; This was a great deal from him, especially as he had written a pamphlet upon it.</p>
<p class="p24">He observed, &lsquo;The House of Commons was originally not a privilege of the people, but a check for the Crown on the House of Lords. I remember Henry the Eighth wanted them to do something; they hesitated in the morning, but did it in the afternoon. He told them, &ldquo;It is well you did; or half your heads should have been upon Temple-bar.&rdquo; But the House of Commons is now no longer under the power of the crown, and therefore must be bribed.&rsquo; He added, &lsquo;I have no delight in talking of publick affairs.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Of his fellow-collegian, the celebrated Mr. George Whitefield, he said, &lsquo;Whitefield never drew as much attention as a mountebank does; he did not draw attention by doing better than others, but by doing what was strange. Were Astley to preach a sermon standing upon his head on a horse&rsquo;s back, he would collect a multitude to hear him; but no wise man would say he had made a better sermon for that. I never treated Whitefield&rsquo;s ministry with contempt; I believe he did good. He had devoted himself to the lower classes of mankind, and among them he was of use. But when familiarity and noise claim the praise due to knowledge, art, and elegance, we must beat down such pretensions.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">What I have preserved of his conversation during the remainder of my stay in London at this time, is only what follows: I told him that when I objected to keeping company with a notorious infidel, a celebrated friend of ours said to me, &lsquo;I do not think that men who live laxly in the world, as you and I do, can with propriety assume such an authority. Dr. Johnson may, who is uniformly exemplary in his conduct. But it is not very consistent to shun an infidel to-day, and get drunk to-morrow.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Nay, Sir, this is sad reasoning. Because a man cannot be right in all things, is he to be right in nothing? Because a man sometimes gets drunk, is he therefore to steal? This doctrine would very soon bring a man to the gallows.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">After all, however, it is a difficult question how far sincere Christians should associate with the avowed enemies of religion; for in the first place, almost every man&rsquo;s mind may be more or less &lsquo;corrupted by evil communications;&rsquo; secondly, the world may very naturally suppose that they are not really in earnest in religion, who can easily bear its opponents; and thirdly, if the profane find themselves quite well received by the pious, one of the checks upon an open declaration of their infidelity, and one of the probable chances of obliging them seriously to reflect, which their being shunned would do, is removed.</p>
<p class="p24">He, I know not why, shewed upon all occasions an aversion to go to Ireland, where I proposed to him that we should make a tour. JOHNSON. &lsquo;It is the last place where I should wish to travel.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Should you not like to see Dublin, Sir?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;No, Sir? Dublin is only a worse capital.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Is not the Giant&rsquo;s-Causeway worth seeing?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Worth seeing? yes; but not worth going to see.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Yet he had a kindness for the Irish nation, and thus generously expressed himself to a gentleman from that country, on the subject of an UNION which artful Politicians have often had in view&mdash; &lsquo;Do not make an union with us, Sir. We should unite with you, only to rob you. We should have robbed the Scotch, if they had had any thing of which we could have robbed them.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Of an acquaintance of ours, whose manners and every thing about him, though expensive, were coarse, he said, &lsquo;Sir, you see in him vulgar prosperity.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">A foreign minister of no very high talents, who had been in his company for a considerable time quite overlooked, happened luckily to mention that he had read some of his <span class="t8">Rambler</span> in Italian, and admired it much. This pleased him greatly; he observed that the title had been translated, <span class="t8">Il Genio errante</span>, though I have been told it was rendered more ludicrously, <span class="t8">Il Vagabondo</span>; and finding that this minister gave such a proof of his taste, he was all attention to him, and on the first remark which he made, however simple, exclaimed, &lsquo;The Ambassadour says well &mdash; His Excellency observes &mdash; .&rsquo; And then he expanded and enriched the little that had been said, in so strong a manner, that it appeared something of consequence. This was exceedingly entertaining to the company who were present, and many a time afterwards it furnished a pleasant topick of merriment: &lsquo;<span class="t8">The Ambassadeur says well</span>,&rsquo; became a laughable term of applause, when no mighty matter had been expressed.</p>
<p class="p26">I left London on Monday, October 18, and accompanied Colonel Stuart to<br/>Chester, where his regiment was to lye for some time.</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;Mr. Boswell to Dr. Johnson.<br/>&lsquo;Chester, October 22, 1779.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;My Dear Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;It was not till one o&rsquo;clock on Monday morning, that Colonel Stuart and I left London; for we chose to bid a cordial adieu to Lord Mountstuart, who was to set out on that day on his embassy to Turin. We drove on excellently, and reached Lichfield in good time enough that night. The Colonel had heard so preferable a character of the George, that he would not put up at the Three Crowns, so that I did not see our host Wilkins. We found at the George as good accommodation as we could wish to have, and I fully enjoyed the comfortable thought that <span class="t8">I was in Lichfield again</span>. Next morning it rained very hard; and as I had much to do in a little time, I ordered a post-chaise, and between eight and nine sallied forth to make a round of visits. I first went to Mr. Green, hoping to have had him to accompany me to all my other friends, but he was engaged to attend the Bishop of Sodor and Man, who was then lying at Lichfield very ill of the gout. Having taken a hasty glance at the additions to Green&rsquo;s museum, from which it was not easy to break away, I next went to the Friery, where I at first occasioned some tumult in the ladies, who were not prepared to receive <span class="t8">company</span> so early: but my <span class="t8">name</span>, which has by wonderful felicity come to be closely associated with yours, soon made all easy; and Mrs. Cobb and Miss Adye re-assumed their seats at the breakfast-table, which they had quitted with some precipitation. They received me with the kindness of an old acquaintance; and after we had joined in a cordial chorus to <span class="t8">your</span> praise, Mrs. Cobb gave <span class="t8">me</span> the high satisfaction of hearing that you said, &ldquo;Boswell is a man who I believe never left a house without leaving a wish for his return.&rdquo; And she afterwards added, that she bid you tell me, that if ever I came to Lichfield, she hoped I would take a bed at the Friery. From thence I drove to Peter Garrick&rsquo;s, where I also found a very flattering welcome. He appeared to me to enjoy his usual chearfulness; and he very kindly asked me to come when I could, and pass a week with him. From Mr. Garrick&rsquo;s, I went to the Palace to wait on Mr. Seward. I was first entertained by his lady and daughter, he himself being in bed with a cold, according to his valetudinary custom. But he desired to see me; and I found him drest in his black gown, with a white flannel night-gown above it; so that he looked like a Dominican friar. He was good-humoured and polite; and under his roof too my reception was very pleasing. I then proceeded to Stow-hill, and first paid my respects to Mrs. Gastrell, whose conversation I was not willing to quit. But my sand-glass was now beginning to run low, as I could not trespass too long on the Colonel&rsquo;s kindness, who obligingly waited for me; so I hastened to Mrs. Aston&rsquo;s, whom I found much better than I feared I should; and there I met a brother-in-law of these ladies, who talked much of you, and very well too, as it appeared to me. It then only remained to visit Mrs. Lucy Porter, which I did, I really believe, with sincere satisfaction on both sides. I am sure I was glad to see her again; and, as I take her to be very honest, I trust she was glad to see me again; for she expressed herself so, that I could not doubt of her being in earnest. What a great key-stone of kindness, my dear Sir, were you that morning! for we were all held together by our common attachment to you. I cannot say that I ever passed two hours with more self-complacency than I did those two at Lichfield. Let me not entertain any suspicion that this is idle vanity. Will not you confirm me in my persuasion, that he who finds himself so regarded has just reason to be happy?</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;We got to Chester about midnight on Tuesday; and here again I am in a state of much enjoyment. Colonel Stuart and his officers treat me with all the civility I could wish; and I play my part admirably. <span class="t8">Laetus aliis, sapiens sibi</span>, the classical sentence which you, I imagine, invented the other day, is exemplified in my present existence. The Bishop, to whom I had the honour to be known several years ago, shews me much attention; and I am edified by his conversation. I must not omit to tell you, that his Lordship admires, very highly, your <span class="t8">Prefaces to the Poets</span>. I am daily obtaining an extension of agreeable acquaintance, so that I am kept in animated variety; and the study of the place itself, by the assistance of books, and of the Bishop, is sufficient occupation. Chester pleases my fancy more than any town I ever saw. But I will not enter upon it at all in this letter.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;How long I shall stay here I cannot yet say. I told a very pleasing young lady, niece to one of the Prebendaries, at whose house I saw her, &ldquo;I have come to Chester, Madam, I cannot tell how; and far less can I tell how I am to get away from it.&rdquo; Do not think me too juvenile. I beg it of you, my dear Sir, to favour me with a letter while I am here, and add to the happiness of a happy friend, who is ever, with affectionate veneration,</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;Most sincerely yours,<br/>&lsquo;James Boswell.&rsquo;</p>
