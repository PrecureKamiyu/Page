It sometimes keeps its natural sound; as <span class="t8">loose, designation</span>; for which I know not whether any rules can be given.</p>
<p class="p33">In the end of monosyllables it is sometimes <span class="t8">s</span>, as in <span class="t8">this</span>; and sometimes <span class="t8">z</span>, as in <span class="t8">as, has</span>; and generally where <span class="t8">es</span> stands in verbs for <span class="t8">eth</span>, as <span class="t8">gives</span>. It seems to be established as a rule, that no noun singular should end with <span class="t8">s</span> single: therefore in words written with diphthongs, and naturally long, an <span class="t8">e</span> is nevertheless added at the end, as <span class="t8">goose, house</span>; and where the syllable is short the <span class="t8">s</span> is doubled, and was once <span class="t8">sse</span>, as <span class="t8">ass</span>, anciently <span class="t8">asse; wilderness</span>, anciently <span class="t8">wildernesse; distress</span>, anciently <span class="t8">distresse</span>.</p>
