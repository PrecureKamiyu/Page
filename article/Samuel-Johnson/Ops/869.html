<p class="p26">When Stella strikes the tuneful string,<br/>In scenes of imitated spring,<br/>Where beauty lavishes her pow&rsquo;rs<br/>On beds of never-fading flow&rsquo;rs,<br/>And pleasure propagates around<br/>Each charm of modulated sound;<br/>Ah! think not, in the dang&rsquo;rous hour,<br/>The nymph fictitious as the flow&rsquo;r;<br/>But shun, rash youth, the gay alcove,<br/>Nor tempt the snares of wily love.<br/>When charms thus press on ev&rsquo;ry sense,<br/>What thought of flight, or of defence?<br/>Deceitful hope, and vain desire,<br/>For ever flutter o&rsquo;er her lyre,<br/>Delighting, as the youth draws nigh,<br/>To point the glances of her eye,<br/>And forming, with unerring art,<br/>New chains to hold the captive heart.<br/>But on those regions of delight<br/>Might truth intrude with daring flight,<br/>Could Stella, sprightly, fair, and young,<br/>One moment hear the moral song,<br/>Instruction, with her flowers, might spring,<br/>And wisdom warble from her string.<br/>Mark, when from thousand mingled dies<br/>Thou seest one pleasing form arise,<br/>How active light, and thoughtful shade<br/>In greater scenes each other aid;<br/>Mark, when the different notes agree<br/>In friendly contrariety,<br/>How passion&rsquo;s well-accorded strife<br/>Gives all the harmony of life;<br/>Thy pictures shall thy conduct frame,<br/>Consistent still, though not the same;<br/>Thy musick teach the nobler art,<br/>To tune the regulated heart.</p>
