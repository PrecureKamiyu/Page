<h2 class="h20"><a id="a741"></a>No. 7. SATURDAY, MAY 27, 1758.</h2>
<p class="p21">One of the principal amusements of the <span class="t8">Idler</span> is to read the works of those minute historians the writers of news, who, though contemptuously overlooked by the composers of bulky volumes, are yet necessary in a nation where much wealth produces much leisure, and one part of the people has nothing to do but to observe the lives and fortunes of the other.</p>
<p class="p24">To us, who are regaled every morning and evening with intelligence, and are supplied from day to day with materials for conversation, it is difficult to conceive how man can subsist without a newspaper, or to what entertainment companies can assemble, in those wide regions of the earth that have neither <span class="t8">Chronicles</span> nor <span class="t8">Magazines</span>, neither <span class="t8">Gazettes</span> nor <span class="t8">Advertisers</span>, neither <span class="t8">Journals</span> nor <span class="t8">Evening Posts</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">There are never great numbers in any nation, whose reason or invention can find employment for their tongues, who can raise a pleasing discourse from their own stock of sentiments and images; and those few who have qualified themselves by speculation for general disquisitions are soon left without an audience. The common talk of men must relate to facts in which the talkers have, or think they have, an interest; and where such facts cannot be known, the pleasures of society will be merely sensual. Thus the natives of the Mahometan empires, who approach most nearly to European civility, have no higher pleasure at their convivial assemblies than to hear a piper, or gaze upon a tumbler; and no company can keep together longer than they are diverted by sounds or shows.</p>
<p class="p24">All foreigners remark, that the knowledge of the common people of England is greater than that of any other vulgar. This superiority we undoubtedly owe to the rivulets of intelligence, which are continually trickling among us, which every one may catch, and of which every one partakes.</p>
<p class="p24">This universal diffusion of instruction is, perhaps, not wholly without its inconveniencies; it certainly fills the nation with superficial disputants; enables those to talk who were born to work; and affords information sufficient to elate vanity, and stiffen obstinacy, but too little to enlarge the mind into complete skill for full comprehension.</p>
<p class="p24">Whatever is found to gratify the publick, will be multiplied by the emulation of venders beyond necessity or use. This plenty indeed produces cheapness, but cheapness always ends in negligence and depravation.</p>
<p class="p24">The compilation of newspapers is often committed to narrow and mercenary minds, not qualified for the task of delighting or instructing; who are content to fill their paper, with whatever matter, without industry to gather, or discernment to select.</p>
<p class="p24">Thus journals are daily multiplied without increase of knowledge. The tale of the morning paper is told again in the evening, and the narratives of the evening are bought again in the morning. These repetitions, indeed, waste time, but they do not shorten it. The most eager peruser of news is tired before he has completed his labour; and many a man, who enters the coffee-house in his nightgown and slippers, is called away to his shop, or his dinner, before he has well considered the state of Europe.</p>
<p class="p24">It is discovered by Reaumur, that spiders might make silk, if they could be persuaded to live in peace together. The writers of news, if they could be confederated, might give more pleasure to the publick. The morning and evening authors might divide an event between them; a single action, and that not of much importance, might be gradually discovered, so as to vary a whole week with joy, anxiety, and conjecture.</p>
<p class="p24">We know that a French ship of war was lately taken by a ship of England; but this event was suffered to burst upon us all at once, and then what we knew already was echoed from day to day, and from week to week.</p>
<p class="p24">Let us suppose these spiders of literature to spin together, and inquire to what an extensive web such another event might be regularly drawn, and how six morning and six evening writers might agree to retail their articles.</p>
<p class="p24">On <span class="t8">Monday Morning</span> the Captain of a ship might arrive, who left the <span class="t8">Friseur</span> of <span class="t8">France</span>, and the <span class="t8">Bull-dog</span>, Captain <span class="t8">Grim</span>, in sight of one another, so that an engagement seemed unavoidable.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Monday Evening.</span> A sound of cannon was heard off Cape Finisterre, supposed to be those of the Bull-dog and Friseur.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Tuesday Morning.</span> It was this morning reported that the Bull-dog engaged the Friseur, yard-arm and yard-arm, three glasses and a half, but was obliged to sheer off for want of powder. It is hoped that inquiry will be made into this affair in a proper place.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Tuesday Evening.</span> The account of the engagement between the Bull-dog and Friseur was premature.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Wednesday Morning.</span> Another express is arrived, which brings news, that the Friseur had lost all her masts, and three hundred of her men, in the late engagement; and that Captain Grim is come into harbour much shattered.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Wednesday Evening.</span> We hear that the brave Captain Grim, having expended his powder, proposed to enter the Friseur sword in hand; but that his lieutenant, the nephew of a certain nobleman, remonstrated against it.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Thursday Morning</span>. We wait impatiently for a full account of the late engagement between the Bull-dog and Friseur.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Thursday Evening</span>. It is said the order of the Bath will be sent to Captain Grim.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Friday Morning</span>. A certain Lord of the Admiralty has been heard to say of a certain Captain, that if he had done his duty, a certain French ship might have been taken. It was not thus that merit was rewarded in the days of Cromwell.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Friday Evening</span>. There is certain information at the Admiralty, that the Friseur is taken, after a resistance of two hours.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Saturday Morning</span>. A letter from one of the gunners of the Bull-dog mentions the taking of the Friseur, and attributes their success wholly to the bravery and resolution of Captain Grim, who never owed any of his advancement to borough-jobbers, or any other corrupters of the people.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Saturday Evening</span>. Captain Grim arrived at the Admiralty, with an account that he engaged the Friseur, a ship of equal force with his own, off Cape Finisterre, and took her after an obstinate resistance, having killed one hundred and fifty of the French, with the loss of ninety-five of his own men.</p>
<p class="p24">For some pleasing remarks on this subject see De Lolme on the constitution of England, chap. 12. We cannot retrain from quoting here the speech of Sir James Mackintosh in the well known Peltier cause. &ldquo;A sort of prophetic instinct, if I may so speak, seems to have revealed to her (Queen Elizabeth) the importance of that great instrument, for rousing and guiding the minds of men, of the effects of which she had no experience; which, since her time, has changed the condition of the world; but which few modern statesmen have thoroughly understood, or wisely employed; which is no doubt connected with many ridiculous and degrading details; which has produced, and may again produce, terrible mischiefs; but of which the influence must after all be considered as the most certain effect of the most efficacious cause of civilization; and which, whether it be a blessing or a curse, is the most powerful engine that a politician can move &mdash; I mean the Press. It is a curious fact, that in the year of the Armada, Queen Elizabeth caused to be printed the first Gazettes that ever appeared in England.&rdquo;</p>
