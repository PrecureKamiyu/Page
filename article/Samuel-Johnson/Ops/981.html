<p class="p24">&lsquo;Where ignorance is bliss, &rsquo;tis folly to be wise,&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">is, in many respects, more than poetically just. Let us cultivate, under the command of good principles, &lsquo;<span class="t8">la théorie des sensations agréables</span>;&rsquo; and, as Mr. Burke once admirably counselled a grave and anxious gentleman, &lsquo;live pleasant.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">The effect of <span class="t8">Rasselas</span>, and of Johnson&rsquo;s other moral tales, is thus beautifully illustrated by Mr. Courtenay:</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;Impressive truth, in splendid fiction drest,<br/>Checks the vain wish, and calms the troubled breast;<br/>O&rsquo;er the dark mind a light celestial throws,<br/>And sooths the angry passions to repose;<br/>As oil effus&rsquo;d illumes and smooths the deep,<br/>When round the bark the swelling surges sweep.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">It will be recollected, that during all this year he carried on his Idler, and, no doubt, was proceeding, though slowly, in his edition of <span class="t8">Shakspeare</span>. He, however, from that liberality which never failed, when called upon to assist other labourers in literature, found time to translate for Mrs. Lennox&rsquo;s English version of Brumoy, &lsquo;A Dissertation on the Greek Comedy,&rsquo;[dagger] and &lsquo;The General Conclusion of the book.&rsquo;[dagger]</p>
<p class="p24">An inquiry into the state of foreign countries was an object that seems at all times to have interested Johnson. Hence Mr. Newbery found no great difficulty in persuading him to write the Introduction[*] to a collection of voyages and travels published by him under the title of <span class="t8">The World Displayed</span>; the first volume of which appeared this year, and the remaining volumes in subsequent years.</p>
<p class="p24">I would ascribe to this year the following letter to a son of one of his early friends at Lichfield, Mr. Joseph Simpson, Barrister, and authour of a tract entitled <span class="t8">Reflections on the Study of the Law</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;If you married imprudently, you miscarried at your own hazard, at an age when you had a right of choice. It would be hard if the man might not choose his own wife, who has a right to plead before the Judges of his country.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;If your imprudence has ended in difficulties and inconveniences, you are yourself to support them; and, with the help of a little better health, you would support them and conquer them. Surely, that want which accident and sickness produces, is to be supported in every region of humanity, though there were neither friends nor fathers in the world. You have certainly from your father the highest claim of charity, though none of right; and therefore I would counsel you to omit no decent nor manly degree of importunity. Your debts in the whole are not large, and of the whole but a small part is troublesome. Small debts are like small shot; they are rattling on every side, and can scarcely be escaped without a wound: great debts are like cannon; of loud noise, but little danger. You must, therefore, be enabled to discharge petty debts, that you may have leisure, with security, to struggle with the rest. Neither the great nor little debts disgrace you. I am sure you have my esteem for the courage with which you contracted them, and the spirit with which you endure them. I wish my esteem could be of more use. I have been invited, or have invited myself, to several parts of the kingdom; and will not incommode my dear Lucy by coming to Lichfield, while her present lodging is of any use to her. I hope, in a few days, to be at leisure, and to make visits. Whither I shall fly is matter of no importance. A man unconnected is at home every where; unless he may be said to be at home no where. I am sorry, dear Sir, that where you have parents, a man of your merits should not have an home. I wish I could give it you. I am, my dear Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Affectionately yours,</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He now refreshed himself by an excursion to Oxford, of which the following short characteristical notice, in his own words, is preserved: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo; &mdash;&mdash; is now making tea for me. I have been in my gown ever since I came here. It was, at my first coming, quite new and handsome. I have swum thrice, which I had disused for many years. I have proposed to Vansittart, climbing over the wall, but he has refused me. And I have clapped my hands till they are sore, at Dr. King&rsquo;s speech.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">His negro servant, Francis Barber, having left him, and been some time at sea, not pressed as has been supposed, but with his own consent, it appears from a letter to John Wilkes, Esq., from Dr. Smollet, that his master kindly interested himself in procuring his release from a state of life of which Johnson always expressed the utmost abhorrence. He said, &lsquo;No man will be a sailor who has contrivance enough to get himself into a jail; for being in a ship is being in a jail, with the chance of being drowned.&rsquo; And at another time, &lsquo;A man in a jail has more room, better food, and commonly better company.&rsquo; The letter was as follows: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Chelsea, March 16, 1759.</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am again your petitioner, in behalf of that great CHAM of literature, Samuel Johnson. His black servant, whose name is Francis Barber, has been pressed on board the Stag Frigate, Captain Angel, and our lexicographer is in great distress. He says the boy is a sickly lad, of a delicate frame, and particularly subject to a malady in his throat, which renders him very unfit for his Majesty&rsquo;s service. You know what manner of animosity the said Johnson has against you; and I dare say you desire no other opportunity of resenting it than that of laying him under an obligation. He was humble enough to desire my assistance on this occasion, though he and I were never cater-cousins; and I gave him to understand that I would make application to my friend Mr. Wilkes, who, perhaps, by his interest with Dr. Hay and Mr. Elliot, might be able to procure the discharge of his lacquey. It would be superfluous to say more on the subject, which I leave to your own consideration; but I cannot let slip this opportunity of declaring that I am, with the most inviolable esteem and attachment, dear Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your affectionate, obliged, humble servant,</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">&lsquo;T. SMOLLET.&rsquo;</span></p>
<p class="p21">Mr. Wilkes, who upon all occasions has acted, as a private gentleman, with most polite liberality, applied to his friend Sir George Hay, then one of the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty; and Francis Barber was discharged, as he has told me, without any wish of his own. He found his old master in Chambers in the Inner Temple, and returned to his service.</p>
<p class="p24">What particular new scheme of life Johnson had in view this year, I have not discovered; but that he meditated one of some sort, is clear from his private devotions, in which we find, &lsquo;the change of outward things which I am now to make;&rsquo; and, &lsquo;Grant me the grace of thy Holy Spirit, that the course which I am now beginning may proceed according to thy laws, and end in the enjoyment of thy favour.&rsquo; But he did not, in fact, make any external or visible change.</p>
<p class="p24">At this time, there being a competition among the architects of London to be employed in the building of Blackfriars-bridge, a question was very warmly agitated whether semicircular or elliptical arches were preferable. In the design offered by Mr. Mylne the elliptical form was adopted, and therefore it was the great object of his rivals to attack it. Johnson&rsquo;s regard for his friend Mr. Gwyn induced him to engage in this controversy against Mr. Mylne; and after being at considerable pains to study the subject, he wrote three several letters in the <span class="t8">Gazetteer</span>, in opposition to his plan.</p>
<p class="p24">If it should be remarked that this was a controversy which lay quite out of Johnson&rsquo;s way, let it be remembered, that after all, his employing his powers of reasoning and eloquence upon a subject which he had studied on the moment, is not more strange than what we often observe in lawyers, who, as <span class="t8">Quicquid agunt homines</span> is the matter of law-suits, are sometimes obliged to pick up a temporary knowledge of an art or science, of which they understood nothing till their brief was delivered, and appear to be much masters of it. In like manner, members of the legislature frequently introduce and expatiate upon subjects of which they have informed themselves for the occasion.</p>
<p class="p24">1760: ÆTAT. 51]. &mdash; In 1760 he wrote <span class="t8">An Address of the Painters to George III. on his Accession to the Throne of these Kingdoms</span>,[dagger] which no monarch ever ascended with more sincere congratulations from his people. Two generations of foreign princes had prepared their minds to rejoice in having again a King, who gloried in being &lsquo;born a Briton.&rsquo; He also wrote for Mr. Baretti, the dedication[dagger] of his <span class="t8">Italian and English Dictionary</span> to the Marquis of Abreu, then Envoy-Extraordinary from Spain at the Court of Great Britain.</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson was now neither very idle, nor very busy with his <span class="t8">Shakspeare</span>; for I can find no other public composition by him except an introduction to the proceedings of the Committee for cloathing the French Prisoners;[*] one of the many proofs that he was ever awake to the calls of humanity; and an account which he gave in the Gentlemen&rsquo;s Magazine of Mr. Tytler&rsquo;s acute and able vindication of Mary Queen of Scots.[*] The generosity of Johnson&rsquo;s feelings shines forth in the following sentence: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&ldquo;It has now been fashionable, for near half a century, to defame and vilify the house of Stuart and, to exalt and magnify the reign of Elizabeth. The Stuarts have found few apologists, for the dead cannot pay for praise; and who will, without reward, oppose the tide of popularity? Yet there remains still among us, not wholly extinguished, a zeal for truth, a desire of establishing right in opposition to fashion&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="p24">In this year I have not discovered a single private letter, written by him to any of his friends. It should seem, however, that he had at this period a floating intention of writing a history of the recent and wonderful successes of the British arms in all quarters of the globe; for among his resolutions or memorandums, September 18, &lsquo;send for books for Hist. of War.&rsquo; How much is it to be regretted that this intention was not fulfilled. His majestick expression would have carried down to the latest posterity the glorious achievements of his country with the same fervent glow which they produced on the mind of the time. He would have been under no temptation to deviate in any degree from truth, which he held very sacred, or to take a licence, which a learned divine told me he once seemed, in a conversation, jocularly to allow to historians.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;There are (said he) inexcusable lies, and consecrated lies. For instance, we are told that on the arrival of the news of the unfortunate battle of Fontenoy, every heart beat, and every eye was in tears. Now we know, that no man eat his dinner the worse, but there <span class="t8">should</span> have been all this concern; and to say there <span class="t8">was</span>, (smiling) may be reckoned a consecrated lie.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">This year Mr. Murphy, having thought himself ill-treated by the Reverend Dr. Francklin, who was one of the writers of <span class="t8">The Critical Review</span>, published an indignant vindication in <span class="t8">A Poetical Epistle to Samuel Johnson, A.M</span>., in which he compliments Johnson in a just and elegant manner:</p>
<p class="p26">Transcendant Genius! whose prolific vein<br/>Ne&rsquo;er knew the frigid poet&rsquo;s toil and pain;<br/>To whom APOLLO opens all his store,<br/>And every Muse presents her sacred lore;<br/>Say, pow&rsquo;rful JOHNSON, whence thy verse is fraught<br/>With so much grace and such energy of thought;<br/>Whether thy JUVENAL instructs the age<br/>In chaster numbers, and new-points his rage;<br/>Or fair IRENE sees, alas! too late.<br/>Her innocence exchang&rsquo;d for guilty state;<br/>Whatever you write, in every golden line<br/>Sublimity and elegance combine;<br/>Thy nervous phrase impresses every soul,<br/>While harmony gives rapture to the whole.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Again, towards the conclusion:</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;Thou then, my friend, who seest the dang&rsquo;rous strife<br/>In which some demon bids me plunge my life,<br/>To the Aonian fount direct my feet,<br/>Say where the Nine thy lonely musings meet?<br/>Where warbles to thy ear the sacred throng,<br/>Thy moral sense, thy dignity of song?<br/>Tell, for you can, by what unerring art<br/>You wake to finer feelings every heart;<br/>In each bright page some truth important give,<br/>And bid to future times thy RAMBLER live?</p>
<p class="p24">I take this opportunity to relate the manner in which an acquaintance first commenced between Dr. Johnson and Mr. Murphy. During the publication of <span class="t8">The Grays-Inn Journal</span>, a periodical paper which was successfully carried on by Mr. Murphy alone, when a very young man, he happened to be in the country with Mr. Foote; and having mentioned that he was obliged to go to London in order to get ready for the press in one of the numbers of that <span class="t8">Journal</span>, Foote said to him, &lsquo;You need not to go on that account. Here is a French magazine, in which you will find a very pretty oriental tale; translate that, and send it to your printer.&rsquo; Mr. Murphy having read the tale, was highly pleased with it, and followed Foote&rsquo;s advice. When he returned to town, this tale was pointed out to him in <span class="t8">The Rambler</span>, from whence it had been translated into the French magazine. Mr. Murphy then waited upon Johnson, to explain this curious incident. His talents, literature, and gentleman-like manners, were soon perceived by Johnson, and a friendship was formed which was never broken.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To BENNET LANGTON, ESQ., AT LANGTON, NEAR SPILSBY, LINCOLNSHIRE.</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;You that travel about the world, have more materials for letters, than I who stay at home; and should, therefore, write with frequency equal to your opportunities. I should be glad to have all England surveyed by you, if you would impart your observations in narratives as agreeable as your last. Knowledge is always to be wished to those who can communicate it well. While you have been riding and running, and seeing the tombs of the learned, and the camps of the valiant, I have only staid at home, and intended to do great things, which I have not done. Beau went away to Cheshire, and has not yet found his way back. Chambers passed the vacation at Oxford.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am very sincerely solicitous for the preservation or curing of Mr. Langton&rsquo;s sight, and am glad that the chirurgeon at Coventry gives him so much hope. Mr. Sharpe is of opinion that the tedious maturation of the cataract is a vulgar errour, and that it may be removed as soon as it is formed. This notion deserves to be considered; I doubt whether it be universally true; but if it be true in some cases, and those cases can be distinguished, it may save a long and uncomfortable delay.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Of dear Mrs. Langton you give me no account; which is the less friendly, as you know how highly I think of her, and how much I interest myself in her health. I suppose you told her of my opinion, and likewise suppose it was not followed; however, I still believe it to be right.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Let me hear from you again, wherever you are, or whatever you are doing; whether you wander or sit still, plant trees or make <span class="t8">Rusticks</span>, play with your sisters or muse alone; and in return I will tell you the success of Sheridan, who at this instant is playing Cato, and has already played Richard twice. He had more company the second than the first night, and will make, I believe, a good figure in the whole, though his faults seem to be very many; some of natural deficience, and some of laborious affectation. He has, I think, no power of assuming either that dignity or elegance which some men, who have little of either in common life, can exhibit on the stage. His voice when strained is unpleasing, and when low is not always heard. He seems to think too much on the audience, and turns his face too often to the galleries.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;However, I wish him well; and among other reasons, because I like his wife.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Make haste to write to, dear Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your most affectionate servant,</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Oct. 18, 1760.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">1761: ÆTAT. 52. &mdash; In 1761 Johnson appears to have done little. He was still, no doubt, proceeding in his edition of <span class="t8">Shakespeare</span>; but what advances he made in it cannot be ascertained. He certainly was at this time not active; for in his scrupulous examination of himself on Easter eve, he laments, in his too rigorous mode of censuring his own conduct, that his life, since the communion of the preceding Easter, had been &lsquo;dissipated and useless.&rsquo; He, however, contributed this year the Preface[*] to <span class="t8">Rolt&rsquo;s Dictionary of Trade and Commerce</span>, in which he displays such a clear and comprehensive knowledge of the subject, as might lead the reader to think that its authour had devoted all his life to it. I asked him whether he knew much of Rolt, and of his work. &lsquo;Sir, (said he) I never saw the man, and never read the book. The booksellers wanted a Preface to a <span class="t8">Dictionary of Trade and Commerce</span>. I knew very well what such a Dictionary should be, and I wrote a Preface accordingly.&rsquo; Rolt, who wrote a great deal for the booksellers, was, as Johnson told me, a singular character. Though not in the least acquainted with him, he used to say, &lsquo;I am just come from Sam. Johnson.&rsquo; This was a sufficient specimen of his vanity and impudence. But he gave a more eminent proof of it in our sister kingdom, as Dr. Johnson informed me. When Akenside&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Pleasures of the Imagination</span> first came out, he did not put his name to the poem. Rolt went over to Dublin, published an edition of it, and put his own name to it. Upon the fame of this he lived for several months, being entertained at the best tables as &lsquo;the ingenious Mr. Rolt.&rsquo; His conversation indeed, did not discover much of the fire of a poet; but it was recollected, that both Addison and Thomson were equally dull till excited by wine. Akenside having been informed of this imposition, vindicated his right by publishing the poem with its real authour&rsquo;s name. Several instances of such literary fraud have been detected. The Reverend Dr. Campbell, of St. Andrew&rsquo;s, wrote <span class="t8">An Enquiry into the original of Moral Virtue</span>, the manuscript of which he sent to Mr. Innes, a clergyman in England, who was his countryman and acquaintance. Innes published it with his own name to it; and before the imposition was discovered, obtained considerable promotion, as a reward of his merit.</p>
<p class="p24">The celebrated Dr. Hugh Blair, and his cousin Mr. George Bannatine, when students in divinity, wrote a poem, entitled, <span class="t8">The Resurrection</span>, copies of which were handed about in manuscript. They were, at length, very much surprised to see a pompous edition of it in folio, dedicated to the Princess Dowager of Wales, by a Dr. Douglas, as his own. Some years ago a little novel, entitled <span class="t8">The Man of Feeling</span>, was assumed by Mr. Eccles, a young Irish clergyman, who was afterwards drowned near Bath. He had been at the pains to transcribe the whole book, with blottings, interlineations, and corrections, that it might be shewn to several people as an original. It was, in truth, the production of Mr. Henry Mackenzie, an Attorney in the Exchequer at Edinburgh, who is the authour of several other ingenious pieces; but the belief with regard to Mr. Eccles became so general, that it was thought necessary for Messieurs Strahan and Cadell to publish an advertisement in the newspapers, contradicting the report, and mentioning that they purchase the copyright of Mr. Mackenzie. I can conceive this kind of fraud to be very easily practised with successful effrontery. The <span class="t8">Filiation</span> of a literary performance is difficult of proof; seldom is there any witness present at its birth. A man, either in confidence or by improper means, obtains possession of a copy of it in manuscript, and boldly publishes it as his own. The true authour, in many cases, may not be able to make his title clear. Johnson, indeed, from the peculiar features of his literary offspring, might bid defiance to any attempt to appropriate them to others.</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;But Shakspeare&rsquo;s magick could not copied be,<br/>Within that circle none durst walk but he!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He this year lent his friendly assistance to correct and improve a pamphlet written by Mr. Gwyn, the architect, entitled, <span class="t8">Thoughts on the Coronation of George III</span>.[*]</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson had now for some years admitted Mr. Baretti to his intimacy; nor did their friendship cease upon their being separated by Baretti&rsquo;s revisiting his native country, as appears from Johnson&rsquo;s letters to him.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To MR. JOSEPH BARETTI, AT MILAN.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;You reproach me very often with parsimony of writing: but you may discover by the extent of my paper, that I design to recompence rarity by length. A short letter to a distant friend is, in my opinion, an insult like that of a slight bow or cursory salutation; &mdash; a proof of unwillingness to do much, even where there is a necessity of doing something. Yet it must be remembered, that he who continues the same course of life in the same place, will have little to tell. One week and one year are very like one another. The silent changes made by time are not always perceived; and if they are not perceived, cannot be recounted. I have risen and lain down, talked and mused, while you have roved over a considerable part of Europe; yet I have not envied my Baretti any of his pleasures, though, perhaps, I have envied others his company: and I am glad to have other nations made acquainted with the character of the English, by a traveller who has so nicely inspected our manners, and so successfully studied our literature. I received your kind letter from Falmouth, in which you gave me notice of your departure for Lisbon, and another from Lisbon, in which you told me, that you were to leave Portugal in a few days. To either of these how could any answer be returned? I have had a third from Turin, complaining that I have not answered the former. Your English style still continues in its purity and vigour. With vigour your genius will supply it; but its purity must be continued by close attention. To use two languages familiarly, and without contaminating one by the other, is very difficult: and to use more than two is hardly to be hoped. The praises which some have received for their multiplicity of languages, may be sufficient to excite industry, but can hardly generate confidence.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I know not whether I can heartily rejoice at the kind reception which you have found, or at the popularity to which you are exalted. I am willing that your merit should be distinguished; but cannot wish that your affections may be gained. I would have you happy wherever you are: yet I would have you wish to return to England. If ever you visit us again, you will find the kindness of your friends undiminished. To tell you how many enquiries are made after you, would be tedious, or if not tedious, would be vain; because you may be told in a very few words, that all who knew you wish you well; and that all that you embraced at your departure, will caress you at your return: therefore do not let Italian academicians nor Italian ladies drive us from your thoughts. You may find among us what you will leave behind, soft smiles and easy sonnets. Yet I shall not wonder if all our invitations should be rejected: for there is a pleasure in being considerable at home, which is not easily resisted.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;By conducting Mr. Southwell to Venice, you fulfilled, I know, the original contract: yet I would wish you not wholly to lose him from your notice, but to recommend him to such acquaintance as may best secure him from suffering by his own follies, and to take such general care both of his safety and his interest as may come within your power. His relations will thank you for any such gratuitous attention: at least they will not blame you for any evil that may happen, whether they thank you or not for any good.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;You know that we have a new King and a new Parliament. Of the new Parliament Fitzherbert is a member. We were so weary of our old King, that we are much pleased with his successor; of whom we are so much inclined to hope great things, that most of us begin already to believe them. The young man is hitherto blameless; but it would be unreasonable to expect much from the immaturity of juvenile years, and the ignorance of princely education. He has been long in the hands of the Scots, and has already favoured them more than the English will contentedly endure. But, perhaps, he scarcely knows whom he has distinguished, or whom he has disgusted.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The Artists have instituted a yearly Exhibition of pictures and statues, in imitation, as I am told, of foreign academies. This year was the second Exhibition. They please themselves much with the multitude of spectators, and imagine that the English School will rise in reputation. Reynolds is without a rival, and continues to add thousands to thousands, which he deserves, among other excellencies, by retaining his kindness for Baretti. This Exhibition has filled the heads of the Artists and lovers of art. Surely life, if it be not long, is tedious, since we are forced to call in the assistance of so many trifles to rid us of our time, of that time which never can return.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I know my Baretti will not be satisfied with a letter in which I give him no account of myself: yet what account shall I give him? I have not, since the day of our separation, suffered or done any thing considerable. The only change in my way of life is, that I have frequented the theatre more than in former seasons. But I have gone thither only to escape from myself. We have had many new farces, and the comedy called <span class="t8">The Jealous Wife</span>, which, though not written with much genius, was yet so well adapted to the stage, and so well exhibited by the actors, that it was crowded for near twenty nights. I am digressing from myself to the play-house; but a barren plan must be filled with episodes. Of myself I have nothing to say, but that I have hitherto lived without the concurrence of my own judgment; yet I continue to flatter myself, that, when you return, you will find me mended. I do not wonder that, where the monastick life is permitted, every order finds votaries, and every monastery inhabitants. Men will submit to any rule, by which they may be exempted from the tyranny of caprice and of chance. They are glad to supply by external authority their own want of constancy and resolution, and court the government of others, when long experience has convinced them of their own inability to govern themselves. If I were to visit Italy, my curiosity would be more attracted by convents than by palaces: though I am afraid that I should find expectation in both places equally disappointed, and life in both places supported with impatience and quitted with reluctance. That it must be so soon quitted, is a powerful remedy against impatience; but what shall free us from reluctance? Those who have endeavoured to teach us to die well, have taught few to die willingly: yet I cannot but hope that a good life might end at last in a contented death.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;You see to what a train of thought I am drawn by the mention of myself. Let me now turn my attention upon you. I hope you take care to keep an exact journal, and to register all occurrences and observations; for your friends here expect such a book of travels as has not been often seen. You have given us good specimens in your letters from Lisbon. I wish you had staid longer in Spain, for no country is less known to the rest of Europe; but the quickness of your discernment must make amends for the celerity of your motions. He that knows which way to direct his view, sees much in a little time.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Write to me very often, and I will not neglect to write to you; and I may, perhaps, in time, get something to write: at least, you will know by my letters, whatever else they may have or want, that I continue to be</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your most affectionate friend,</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;London, June 10, 1761.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">1762: ÆTAT. 53. &mdash; In 1762 he wrote for the Reverend Dr. Kennedy, Rector of Bradley in Derbyshire, in a strain of very courtly elegance, a Dedication to the King[*] of that gentleman&rsquo;s work, entitled, <span class="t8">A complete System of Astronomical Chronology, unfolding the Scriptures</span>. He had certainly looked at this work before it was printed; for the concluding paragraph is undoubtedly of his composition, of which let my readers judge:</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Thus have I endeavoured to free Religion and History from the darkness of a disputed and uncertain chronology; from difficulties which have hitherto appeared insuperable, and darkness which no luminary of learning has hitherto been able to dissipate. I have established the truth of the Mosaical account, by evidence which no transcription can corrupt, no negligence can lose, and no interest can pervert. I have shewn that the universe bears witness to the inspiration of its historian, by the revolution of its orbs and the succession of its seasons; <span class="t8">that the stars in their courses fight against</span> incredulity, that the works of GOD give hourly confirmation to the <span class="t8">law</span>, the <span class="t8">prophets</span>, and the <span class="t8">gospel</span>, of which <span class="t8">one day telleth another, and one night certifieth another</span>; and that the validity of the sacred writings can never be denied, while the moon shall increase and wane, and the sun shall know his going down.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He this year wrote also the Dedication[Dagger] to the Earl of Middlesex of Mrs Lennox&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Female Quixote</span>, and the Preface to the <span class="t8">Catalogue of the Artists&rsquo; Exhibition</span>.[Dagger]</p>
<p class="p24">The following letter, which, on account of its intrinsick merit, it would have been unjust both to Johnson and the publick to have with-held, was obtained for me by the solicitation of my friend Mr. Seward:</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To DR. STAUNTON, (NOW SIR GEORGE STAUNTON, BARONET.)</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I make haste to answer your kind letter, in hope of hearing again from you before you leave us. I cannot but regret that a man of your qualifications should find it necessary to seek an establishment in Guadaloupe, which if a peace should restore to the French, I shall think it some alleviation of the loss, that it must restore likewise Dr. Staunton to the English.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;It is a melancholy consideration, that so much of our time is necessarily to be spent upon the care of living, and that we can seldom obtain ease in one respect but by resigning it in another; yet I suppose we are by this dispensation not less happy in the whole, than if the spontaneous bounty of Nature poured all that we want into our hands. A few, if they were thus left to themselves, would, perhaps, spend their time in laudable pursuits; but the greater part would prey upon the quiet of each other, or, in the want of other objects, would prey upon themselves.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;This, however, is our condition, which we must improve and solace as we can: and though we cannot choose always our place of residence, we may in every place find rational amusements, and possess in every place the comforts of piety and a pure conscience.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;In America there is little to be observed except natural curiosities. The new world must have many vegetables and animals with which philosophers are but little acquainted. I hope you will furnish yourself with some books of natural history, and some glasses and other instruments of observation. Trust as little as you can to report; examine all you can by your own senses. I do not doubt but you will be able to add much to knowledge, and, perhaps, to medicine. Wild nations trust to simples; and, perhaps, the Peruvian bark is not the only specifick which those extensive regions may afford us.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Wherever you are, and whatever be your fortune, be certain, dear Sir, that you carry with you my kind wishes; and that whether you return hither, or stay in the other hemisphere, to hear that you are happy will give pleasure to, Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your most affectionate humble servant,</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;June 1, 1762.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">A lady having at this time solicited him to obtain the Archbishop of Canterbury&rsquo;s patronage to have her son sent to the University, one of those solicitations which are too frequent, where people, anxious for a particular object, do not consider propriety, or the opportunity which the persons whom they solicit have to assist them, he wrote to her the following answer, with a copy of which I am favoured by the Reverend Dr. Farmer, Master of Emanuel College, Cambridge.</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">&lsquo;MADAM,</span></p>
<p class="p21">&lsquo;I hope you will believe that my delay in answering your letter could proceed only from my unwillingness to destroy any hope that you had formed. Hope is itself a species of happiness, and, perhaps, the chief happiness which this world affords: but, like all other pleasures immoderately enjoyed, the excesses of hope must be expiated by pain; and expectations improperly indulged, must end in disappointment. If it be asked, what is the improper expectation which it is dangerous to indulge, experience will quickly answer, that it is such expectation as is dictated not by reason, but by desire; expectation raised, not by the common occurrences of life, but by the wants of the expectant; an expectation that requires the common course of things to be changed, and the general rules of action to be broken.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;When you made your request to me, you should have considered, Madam, what you were asking. You ask me to solicit a great man, to whom I never spoke, for a young person whom I had never seen, upon a supposition which I had no means of knowing to be true. There is no reason why, amongst all the great, I should chuse to supplicate the Archbishop, nor why, among all the possible objects of his bounty, the Archbishop should chuse your son. I know, Madam, how unwillingly conviction is admitted, when interest opposes it; but surely, Madam, you must allow, that there is no reason why that should be done by me, which every other man may do with equal reason, and which, indeed, no man can do properly, without some very particular relation both to the Archbishop and to you. If I could help you in this exigence by any proper means, it would give me pleasure; but this proposal is so very remote from all usual methods, that I cannot comply with it, but at the risk of such answer and suspicions as I believe you do not wish me to undergo.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I have seen your son this morning; he seems a pretty youth, and will, perhaps, find some better friend than I can procure him; but, though he should at last miss the University, he may still be wise, useful, and happy. I am, Madam,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your most humble servant,</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;June 8, 1762.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To MR. JOSEPH BARETTI, AT MILAN.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;London, July 20, 1762.</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;However justly you may accuse me for want of punctuality in correspondence, I am not so far lost in negligence as to omit the opportunity of writing to you, which Mr. Beauclerk&rsquo;s passage through Milan affords me.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I suppose you received the <span class="t8">Idlers</span>, and I intend that you shall soon receive <span class="t8">Shakspeare</span>, that you may explain his works to the ladies of Italy, and tell them the story of the editor, among the other strange narratives with which your long residence in this unknown region has supplied you.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;As you have now been long away, I suppose your curiosity may pant for some news of your old friends. Miss Williams and I live much as we did. Miss Cotterel still continues to cling to Mrs. Porter, and Charlotte is now big of the fourth child. Mr. Reynolds gets six thousands a year. Levet is lately married, not without much suspicion that he has been wretchedly cheated in his match. Mr. Chambers is gone this day, for the first time, the circuit with the Judges. Mr. Richardson is dead of an apoplexy, and his second daughter has married a merchant.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;My vanity, or my kindness, makes me flatter myself, that you would rather hear of me than of those whom I have mentioned; but of myself I have very little which I care to tell. Last winter I went down to my native town, where I found the streets much narrower and shorter than I thought I had left them, inhabited by a new race of people, to whom I was very little known. My play-fellows were grown old, and forced me to suspect that I was no longer young. My only remaining friend has changed his principles, and was become the tool of the predominant faction. My daughter-in-law, from whom I expected most, and whom I met with sincere benevolence, has lost the beauty and gaiety of youth, without having gained much of the wisdom of age. I wandered about for five days,&nbsp; and took the first convenient opportunity of returning to a place, where, if there is not much happiness, there is, at least, such a diversity of good and evil, that slight vexations do not fix upon the heart.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I think in a few weeks to try another excursion; though to what end? Let me know, my Baretti, what has been the result of your return to your own country: whether time has made any alteration for the better, and whether, when the first raptures of salutation were over, you did not find your thoughts confessed their disappointment.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Moral sentences appear ostentatious and tumid, when they have no greater occasions than the journey of a wit to his own town: yet such pleasures and such pains make up the general mass of life; and as nothing is little to him that feels it with great sensibility, a mind able to see common incidents in their real state, is disposed by very common incidents to very serious contemplations. Let us trust that a time will come, when the present moment shall be no longer irksome; when we shall not borrow all our happiness from hope, which at last is to end in disappointment.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I beg that you will shew Mr. Beauclerk all the civilities which you have in your power; for he has always been kind to me.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I have lately seen Mr. Stratico, Professor of Padua, who has told me of your quarrel with an Abbot of the Celestine order; but had not the particulars very ready in his memory. When you write to Mr. Marsili, let him know that I remember him with kindness.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;May you, my Baretti, be very happy at Milan, or some other place nearer to, Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your most affectionate humble servant,</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">The accession of George the Third to the throne of these kingdoms, opened a new and brighter prospect to men of literary merit, who had been honoured with no mark of royal favour in the preceding reign. His present Majesty&rsquo;s education in this country, as well as his taste and beneficence, prompted him to be the patron of science and the arts; and early this year Johnson, having been represented to him as a very learned and good man, without any certain provision, his Majesty was pleased to grant him a pension of three hundred pounds a year. The Earl of Bute, who was then Prime Minister, had the honour to announce this instance of his Sovereign&rsquo;s bounty, concerning which, many and various stories, all equally erroneous, have been propagated: maliciously representing it as a political bribe to Johnson, to desert his avowed principles, and become the tool of a government which he held to be founded in usurpation. I have taken care to have it in my power to refute them from the most authentick information. Lord Bute told me, that Mr. Wedderburne, now Lord Loughborough, was the person who first mentioned this subject to him. Lord Loughborough told me, that the pension was granted to Johnson solely as the reward of his literary merit, without any stipulation whatever, or even tacit understanding that he should write for administration. His Lordship added, that he was confident the political tracts which Johnson afterwards did write, as they were entirely consonant with his own opinions, would have been written by him though no pension had been granted to him.</p>
<p class="p24">Mr. Thomas Sheridan and Mr. Murphy, who then lived a good deal both with him and Mr. Wedderburne, told me, that they previously talked with Johnson upon this matter, and that it was perfectly understood by all parties that the pension was merely honorary. Sir Joshua Reynolds told me, that Johnson called on him after his Majesty&rsquo;s intention had been notified to him, and said he wished to consult his friends as to the propriety of his accepting this mark of the royal favour, after the definitions which he had given in his <span class="t8">Dictionary</span> of <span class="t8">pension</span> and <span class="t8">pensioners</span>. He said he would not have Sir Joshua&rsquo;s answer till next day, when he would call again, and desired he might think of it. Sir Joshua answered that he was clear to give his opinion then, that there could be no objection to his receiving from the King a reward for literary merit; and that certainly the definitions in his <span class="t8">Dictionary</span> were not applicable to him. Johnson, it should seem, was satisfied, for he did not call again till he had accepted the pension, and had waited on Lord Bute to thank him. He then told Sir Joshua that Lord Bute said to him expressly, &lsquo;It is not given you for anything you are to do, but for what you have done.&rsquo; His Lordship, he said, behaved in the handsomest manner. He repeated the words twice, that he might be sure Johnson heard them, and thus set his mind perfectly at ease. This nobleman, who has been so virulently abused, acted with great honour in this instance, and displayed a mind truly liberal. A minister of a more narrow and selfish disposition would have availed himself of such an opportunity to fix an implied obligation on a man of Johnson&rsquo;s powerful talents to give him his support.</p>
<p class="p24">Mr. Murphy and the late Mr. Sheridan severally contended for the distinction of having been the first who mentioned to Mr. Wedderburne that Johnson ought to have a pension. When I spoke of this to Lord Loughborough, wishing to know if he recollected the prime mover in the business, he said, &lsquo;All his friends assisted:&rsquo; and when I told him that Mr. Sheridan strenuously asserted his claim to it, his Lordship said, &lsquo;He rang the bell.&rsquo; And it is but just to add, that Mr. Sheridan told me, that when he communicated to Dr. Johnson that a pension was to be granted him, he replied in a fervour of gratitude, &lsquo;The English language does not afford me terms adequate to my feelings on this occasion. I must have recourse to the French. I am <span class="t8">pénétré</span> with his Majesty&rsquo;s goodness.&rsquo; When I repeated this to Dr. Johnson, he did not contradict it.</p>
<p class="p24">His definitions of <span class="t8">pension</span> and <span class="t8">pensioner</span>, partly founded on the satirical verses of Pope, which he quotes, may be generally true; and yet every body must allow, that there may be, and have been, instances of pensions given and received upon liberal and honourable terms. Thus, then, it is clear, that there was nothing inconsistent or humiliating in Johnson&rsquo;s accepting of a pension so unconditionally and so honourably offered to him.</p>
<p class="p24">But I shall not detain my readers longer by any words of my own, on a subject on which I am happily enabled, by the favour of the Earl of Bute, to present them with what Johnson himself wrote; his lordship having been pleased to communicate to me a copy of the following letter to his late father, which does great honour both to the writer, and to the noble person to whom it is addressed:</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">&lsquo;TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE THE EARL OF BUTE.</span></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">&lsquo;MY LORD,</span></p>
<p class="p21">&lsquo;When the bills were yesterday delivered to me by Mr. Wedderburne, I was informed by him of the future favours which his Majesty has, by your Lordship&rsquo;s recommendation, been induced to intend for me.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Bounty always receives part of its value from the manner in which it is bestowed; your Lordship&rsquo;s kindness includes every circumstance that can gratify delicacy, or enforce obligation. You have conferred your favours on a man who has neither alliance nor interest, who has not merited them by services, nor courted them by officiousness; you have spared him the shame of solicitation, and the anxiety of suspense.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;What has been thus elegantly given, will, I hope, not be reproachfully enjoyed; I shall endeavour to give your Lordship the only recompense which generosity desires, &mdash; the gratification of finding that your benefits are not improperly bestowed. I am, my Lord,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your Lordship&rsquo;s most obliged,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Most obedient, and most humble servant,</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;July 20, 1762.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">This year his friend Sir Joshua Reynolds paid a visit of some weeks to his native country, Devonshire, in which he was accompanied by Johnson, who was much pleased with this jaunt, and declared he had derived from it a great accession of new ideas. He was entertained at the seats of several noblemen and gentlemen in the West of England; but the greatest part of the time was passed at Plymouth, where the magnificence of the navy, the ship-building and all its circumstances, afforded him a grand subject of contemplation. The Commissioner of the Dock-yard paid him the compliment of ordering the yacht to convey him and his friend to the Eddystone, to which they accordingly sailed. But the weather was so tempestuous that they could not land.</p>
<p class="p24">Reynolds and he were at this time the guests of Dr. Mudge, the celebrated surgeon, and now physician of that place, not more distinguished for quickness of parts and variety of knowledge, than loved and esteemed for his amiable manners; and here Johnson formed an acquaintance with Dr. Mudge&rsquo;s father, that very eminent divine, the Reverend Zachariah Mudge, Prebendary of Exeter, who was idolised in the west, both for his excellence as a preacher and the uniform perfect propriety of his private conduct. He preached a sermon purposely that Johnson might hear him; and we shall see afterwards that Johnson honoured his memory by drawing his character. While Johnson was at Plymouth, he saw a great many of its inhabitants, and was not sparing of his very entertaining conversation. It was here that he made that frank and truly original confession, that &lsquo;ignorance, pure ignorance,&rsquo; was the cause of a wrong definition in his <span class="t8">Dictionary</span> of the word <span class="t8">pastern</span> , to the no small surprise of the Lady who put the question to him; who having the most profound reverence for his character, so as almost to suppose him endowed with infallibility, expected to hear an explanation (of what, to be sure, seemed strange to a common reader,) drawn from some deep-learned source with which she was unacquainted.</p>
<p class="p24">Sir Joshua Reynolds, to whom I was obliged for my information concerning this excursion, mentions a very characteristical anecdote of Johnson while at Plymouth. Having observed that in consequence of the Dock-yard a new town had arisen about two miles off as a rival to the old; and knowing from his sagacity, and just observation of human nature, that it is certain if a man hates at all, he will hate his next neighbour; he concluded that this new and rising town could not but excite the envy and jealousy of the old, in which conjecture he was very soon confirmed; he therefore set himself resolutely on the side of the old town, the <span class="t8">established</span> town, in which his lot was cast, considering it as a kind of duty to <span class="t8">stand by</span> it. He accordingly entered warmly into its interests, and upon every occasion talked of the <span class="t8">dockers</span>, as the inhabitants of the new town were called, as upstarts and aliens. Plymouth is very plentifully supplied with water by a river brought into it from a great distance, which is so abundant that it runs to waste in the town. The Dock, or New-town, being totally destitute of water, petitioned Plymouth that a small portion of the conduit might be permitted to go to them, and this was now under consideration. Johnson, affecting to entertain the passions of the place, was violent in opposition; and, half-laughing at himself for his pretended zeal where he had no concern, exclaimed, &lsquo;No, no! I am against the <span class="t8">dockers</span>; I am a Plymouth-man. Rogues! let them die of thirst. They shall not have a drop!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Lord Macartney obligingly favoured me with a copy of the following letter, in his own hand-writing, from the original, which was found, by the present Earl of Bute, among his father&rsquo;s papers.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To THE RIGHT HONOURABLE THE EARL OF BUTE.</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">&lsquo;MY LORD,</span></p>
<p class="p21">&lsquo;That generosity, by which I was recommended to the favour of his Majesty, will not be offended at a solicitation necessary to make that favour permanent and effectual.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The pension appointed to be paid me at Michaelmas I have not received, and know not where or from whom I am to ask it. I beg, therefore, that your Lordship will be pleased to supply Mr. Wedderburne with such directions as may be necessary, which, I believe, his friendship will make him think it no trouble to convey to me.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To interrupt your Lordship, at a time like this, with such petty difficulties, is improper and unseasonable; but your knowledge of the world has long since taught you, that every man&rsquo;s affairs, however little, are important to himself. Every man hopes that he shall escape neglect; and, with reason, may every man, whose vices do not preclude his claim, expect favour from that beneficence which has been extended to,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;My Lord,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your Lordship&rsquo;s</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Most obliged</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;And</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Most humble servant,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Temple Lane &lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Nov. 3, 1762.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">&lsquo;TO MR. JOSEPH BARETTI, AT MILAN.</span></p>
<p class="p21">&lsquo;London, Dec. 21, 1762.</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">SIR,</span></p>
<p class="p21">&lsquo;You are not to suppose, with all your conviction of my idleness, that I have passed all this time without writing to my Baretti. I gave a letter to Mr. Beauclerk, who, in my opinion, and in his own, was hastening to Naples for the recovery of his health; but he has stopped at Paris, and I know not when he will proceed. Langton is with him.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I will not trouble you with speculations about peace and war. The good or ill success of battles and embassies extends itself to a very small part of domestick life: we all have good and evil, which we feel more sensibly than our petty part of publick miscarriage or prosperity. I am sorry for your disappointment, with which you seem more touched than I should expect a man of your resolution and experience to have been, did I not know that general truths are seldom applied to particular occasions; and that the fallacy of our self-love extends itself as wide as our interest or affections. Every man believes that mistresses are unfaithful, and patrons capricious; but he excepts his own mistress, and his own patron. We have all learned that greatness is negligent and contemptuous, and that in Courts life is often languished away in ungratified expectation; but he that approaches greatness, or glitters in a Court, imagines that destiny has at last exempted him from the common lot.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Do not let such evils overwhelm you as thousands have suffered, and thousands have surmounted; but turn your thoughts with vigour to some other plan of life, and keep always in your mind, that, with due submission to Providence, a man of genius has been seldom ruined but by himself. Your Patron&rsquo;s weakness or insensibility will finally do you little hurt, if he is not assisted by your own passions. Of your love I know not the propriety, nor can estimate the power; but in love, as in every other passion, of which hope is the essence, we ought always to remember the uncertainty of events. There is, indeed, nothing that so much seduces reason from vigilance, as the thought of passing life with an amiable woman; and if all would happen that a lover fancies, I know not what other terrestrial happiness would deserve pursuit. But love and marriage are different states. Those who are to suffer the evils together, and to suffer often for the sake of one another, soon lose that tenderness of look, and that benevolence of mind, which arose from the participation of unmingled pleasure and successive amusement. A woman, we are sure, will not be always fair; we are not sure she will always be virtuous: and man cannot retain through life that respect and assiduity by which he pleases for a day or for a month. I do not, however, pretend to have discovered that life has any thing more to be desired than a prudent and virtuous marriage; therefore know not what counsel to give you.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;If you can quit your imagination of love and greatness, and leave your hopes of preferment and bridal raptures to try once more the fortune of literature and industry, the way through France is now open. We flatter ourselves that we shall cultivate, with great diligence, the arts of peace; and every man will be welcome among us who can teach us any thing we do not know. For your part, you will find all your old friends willing to receive you.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Reynolds still continues to increase in reputation and in riches. Miss Williams, who very much loves you, goes on in the old way. Miss Cotterel is still with Mrs. Porter. Miss Charlotte is married to Dean Lewis, and has three children. Mr. Levet has married a street-walker. But the gazette of my narration must now arrive to tell you, that Bathurst went physician to the army, and died at the Havannah.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I know not whether I have not sent you word that Huggins and Richardson are both dead. When we see our enemies and friends gliding away before us, let us not forget that we are subject to the general law of mortality, and shall soon be where our doom will be fixed for ever.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I pray GOD to bless you, and am, Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your most affectionate humble servant,</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Write soon.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">1763: ÆTAT. 54. &mdash; In 1763 he furnished to <span class="t8">The Poetical Calendar</span>, published by Fawkes and Woty, a character of Collins[*], which he afterwards ingrafted into his entire life of that admirable poet, in the collection of lives which he wrote for the body of English poetry, formed and published by the booksellers of London. His account of the melancholy depression with which Collins was severely afflicted, and which brought him to his grave, is, I think, one of the most tender and interesting passages in the whole series of his writings. He also favoured Mr. Hoole with the Dedication of his translation of <span class="t8">Tasso to the Queen</span>,[*] which is so happily conceived and elegantly expressed, that I cannot but point it out to the peculiar notice of my readers.</p>
<p class="p24">This is to me a memorable year; for in it I had the happiness to obtain the acquaintance of that extraordinary man whose memoirs I am now writing; an acquaintance which I shall ever esteem as one of the most fortunate circumstances in my life. Though then but two-and-twenty, I had for several years read his works with delight and instruction, and had the highest reverence for their authour, which had grown up in my fancy into a kind of mysterious veneration, by figuring to myself a state of solemn elevated abstraction, in which I supposed him to live in the immense metropolis of London. Mr. Gentleman, a native of Ireland, who passed some years in Scotland as a player, and as an instructor in the English language, a man whose talents and worth were depressed by misfortunes, had given me a representation of the figure and manner of DICTIONARY JOHNSON, as he was then generally called; and during my first visit to London, which was for three months in 1760, Mr. Derrick the poet, who was Gentleman&rsquo;s friend and countryman, flattered me with hopes that he would introduce me to Johnson, an honour of which I was very ambitious. But he never found an opportunity; which made me doubt that he had promised to do what was not in his power; till Johnson some years afterwards told me, &lsquo;Derrick, Sir, might very well have introduced you. I had a kindness for Derrick, and am sorry he is dead.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">In the summer of 1761 Mr. Thomas Sheridan was at Edinburgh, and delivered lectures upon the English Language and Publick Speaking to large and respectable audiences. I was often in his company, and heard him frequently expatiate upon Johnson&rsquo;s extraordinary knowledge, talents, and virtues, repeat his pointed sayings, describe his particularities, and boast of his being his guest sometimes till two or three in the morning. At his house I hoped to have many opportunities of seeing the sage, as Mr. Sheridan obligingly assured me I should not be disappointed.</p>
<p class="p24">When I returned to London in the end of 1762, to my surprise and regret I found an irreconcileable difference had taken place between Johnson and Sheridan. A pension of two hundred pounds a year had been given to Sheridan. Johnson, who, as has been already mentioned, thought slightingly of Sheridan&rsquo;s art, upon hearing that he was also pensioned, exclaimed, &lsquo;What! have they given <span class="t8">him</span> a pension? Then it is time for me to give up mine.&rsquo; Whether this proceeded from a momentary indignation, as if it were an affront to his exalted merit that a player should be rewarded in the same manner with him, or was the sudden effect of a fit of peevishness, it was unluckily said, and, indeed, cannot be justified. Mr. Sheridan&rsquo;s pension was granted to him not as a player, but as a sufferer in the cause of government, when he was manager of the Theatre Royal in Ireland, when parties ran high in 1753. And it must also be allowed that he was a man of literature, and had considerably improved the arts of reading and speaking with distinctness and propriety.</p>
<p class="p24">Besides, Johnson should have recollected that Mr. Sheridan taught pronunciation to Mr. Alexander Wedderburne, whose sister was married to Sir Harry Erskine, an intimate friend of Lord Bute, who was the favourite of the King; and surely the most outrageous Whig will not maintain, that, whatever ought to be the principle in the disposal of <span class="t8">offices</span>, a <span class="t8">pension</span> ought never to be granted from any bias of court connection. Mr. Macklin, indeed, shared with Mr. Sheridan the honour of instructing Mr. Wedderburne; and though it was too late in life for a Caledonian to acquire the genuine English cadence, yet so successful were Mr. Wedderburne&rsquo;s instructors, and his own unabating endeavours, that he got rid of the coarse part of his Scotch accent, retaining only as much of the &lsquo;native wood-note wild,&rsquo; as to mark his country; which, if any Scotchman should affect to forget, I should heartily despise him. Notwithstanding the difficulties which are to be encountered by those who have not had the advantage of an English education, he by degrees formed a mode of speaking to which Englishmen do not deny the praise of elegance. Hence his distinguished oratory, which he exerted in his own country as an advocate in the Court of Session, and a ruling elder of the <span class="t8">Kirk</span>, has had its fame and ample reward, in much higher spheres. When I look back on this noble person at Edinburgh, in situations so unworthy of his brilliant powers, and behold LORD LOUGHBOROUGH at London, the change seems almost like one of the metamorphoses in <span class="t8">Ovid</span>; and as his two preceptors, by refining his utterance, gave currency to his talents, we may say in the words of that poet, &lsquo;<span class="t8">Nam vos mutastis</span>,&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I have dwelt the longer upon this remarkable instance of successful parts and assiduity; because it affords animating encouragement to other gentlemen of North-Britain to try their fortunes in the southern part of the Island, where they may hope to gratify their utmost ambition; and now that we are one people by the Union, it would surely be illiberal to maintain, that they have not an equal title with the natives of any other part of his Majesty&rsquo;s dominions.</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson complained that a man who disliked him repeated his sarcasm to Mr. Sheridan, without telling him what followed, which was, that after a pause he added, &lsquo;However, I am glad that Mr. Sheridan has a pension, for he is a very good man.&rsquo; Sheridan could never forgive this hasty contemptuous expression. It rankled in his mind; and though I informed him of all that Johnson said, and that he would be very glad to meet him amicably, he positively declined repeated offers which I made, and once went off abruptly from a house where he and I were engaged to dine, because he was told that Dr. Johnson was to be there. I have no sympathetick feeling with such persevering resentment. It is painful when there is a breach between those who have lived together socially and cordially; and I wonder that there is not, in all such cases, a mutual wish that it should be healed. I could perceive that Mr. Sheridan was by no means satisfied with Johnson&rsquo;s acknowledging him to be a good man. That could not sooth his injured vanity. I could not but smile, at the same time that I was offended, to observe Sheridan in <span class="t8">The Life of Swift</span>, which he afterwards published, attempting, in the writhings of his resentment, to depreciate Johnson, by characterising him as &lsquo;A writer of gigantick fame in these days of little men;&rsquo; that very Johnson whom he once so highly admired and venerated.</p>
<p class="p24">This rupture with Sheridan deprived Johnson of one of his most agreeable resources for amusement in his lonely evenings; for Sheridan&rsquo;s well-informed, animated, and bustling mind never, suffered conversation to stagnate; and Mrs. Sheridan was a most agreeable companion to an intellectual man. She was sensible, ingenious, unassuming, yet communicative. I recollect, with satisfaction, many pleasing hours which I passed with her under the hospitable roof of her husband, who was to me a very kind friend. Her novel, entitled <span class="t8">Memoirs of Miss Sydney Biddulph</span>, contains an excellent moral while it inculcates a future state of retribution; and what it teaches is impressed upon the mind by a series of as deep distress as can affect humanity, in the amiable and pious heroine who goes to her grave unrelieved, but resigned, and full of hope of &lsquo;heaven&rsquo;s mercy.&rsquo; Johnson paid her this high compliment upon it: &lsquo;I know not, Madam, that you have a right, upon moral principles, to make your readers suffer so much.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Mr. Thomas Davies the actor, who then kept a bookseller&rsquo;s shop in Russel-street, Covent-garden, told me that Johnson was very much his friend, and came frequently to his house, where he more than once invited me to meet him; but by some unlucky accident or other he was prevented from coming to us.</p>
<p class="p24">Mr. Thomas Davies was a man of good understanding and talents, with the advantage of a liberal education. Though somewhat pompous, he was an entertaining companion; and his literary performances have no inconsiderable share of merit. He was a friendly and very hospitable man. Both he and his wife, (who has been celebrated for her beauty,) though upon the stage for many years, maintained an uniform decency of character; and Johnson esteemed them, and lived in as easy an intimacy with them, as with any family which he used to visit. Mr. Davies recollected several of Johnson&rsquo;s remarkable sayings, and was one of the best of the many imitators of his voice and manner, while relating them. He increased my impatience more and more to see the extraordinary man whose works I highly valued, and whose conversation was reported to be so peculiarly excellent.</p>
<p class="p24">At last, on Monday the 16th of May, when I was sitting in Mr. Davies&rsquo;s back-parlour, after having drunk tea with him and Mrs. Davies, Johnson unexpectedly came into the shop; and Mr. Davies having perceived him through the glass-door in the room in which we were sitting, advancing towards us, &mdash; he announced his aweful approach to me, somewhat in the manner of an actor in the part of Horatio, when he addresses Hamlet on the appearance of his father&rsquo;s ghost, &lsquo;Look, my Lord, it comes.&rsquo; I found that I had a very perfect idea of Johnson&rsquo;s figure, from the portrait of him painted by Sir Joshua Reynolds soon after he had published his <span class="t8">Dictionary</span>, in the attitude of sitting in his easy chair in deep meditation, which was the first picture his friend did for him, which Sir Joshua very kindly presented to me, and from which an engraving has been made for this work. Mr. Davies mentioned my name, and respectfully introduced me to him. I was much agitated; and recollecting his prejudice against the Scotch, of which I had heard much, I said to Davies, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t tell where I come from.&rsquo;&mdash; &lsquo;From Scotland,&rsquo; cried Davies roguishly. &lsquo;Mr. Johnson, (said I) I do indeed come from Scotland, but I cannot help it.&rsquo; I am willing to flatter myself that I meant this as light pleasantry to sooth and conciliate him, and not as an humiliating abasement at the expence of my country. But however that might be, this speech was somewhat unlucky; for with that quickness of wit for which he was so remarkable, he seized the expression &lsquo;come from Scotland,&rsquo; which I used in the sense of being of that country; and, as if I had said that I had come away from it, or left it, retorted, &lsquo;That, Sir, I find, is what a very great many of your countrymen cannot help.&rsquo; This stroke stunned me a good deal; and when we had sat down, I felt myself not a little embarrassed, and apprehensive of what might come next. He then addressed himself to Davies: &lsquo;What do you think of Garrick? He has refused me an order for the play for Miss Williams, because he knows the house will be full, and that an order would be worth three shillings.&rsquo; Eager to take any opening to get into conversation with him, I ventured to say, &lsquo;O, Sir, I cannot think Mr. Garrick would grudge such a trifle to you.&rsquo; &lsquo;Sir, (said he, with a stern look,) I have known David Garrick longer than you have done: and I know no right you have to talk to me on the subject.&rsquo; Perhaps I deserved this check; for it was rather presumptuous in me, an entire stranger, to express any doubt of the justice of his animadversion upon his old acquaintance and pupil. I now felt myself much mortified, and began to think that the hope which I had long indulged of obtaining his acquaintance was blasted. And, in truth, had not my ardour been uncommonly strong, and my resolution uncommonly persevering, so rough a reception might have deterred me for ever from making any further attempts. Fortunately, however, I remained upon the field not wholly discomfited; and was soon rewarded by hearing some of his conversation, of which I preserved the following short minute, without marking the questions and observations by which it was produced.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;People (he remarked) may be taken in once, who imagine that an authour is greater in private life than other men. Uncommon parts require uncommon opportunities for their exertion.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;In barbarous society, superiority of parts is of real consequence. Great strength or great wisdom is of much value to an individual. But in more polished times there are people to do every thing for money; and then there are a number of other superiorities, such as those of birth and fortune, and rank, that dissipate men&rsquo;s attention, and leave no extraordinary share of respect for personal and intellectual superiority. This is wisely ordered by Providence, to preserve some equality among mankind.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Sir, this book (<span class="t8">The Elements of Criticism</span>&rsquo;, which he had taken up,) is a pretty essay, and deserves to be held in some estimation, though much of it is chimerical.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Speaking of one who with more than ordinary boldness attacked publick measures and the royal family, he said,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I think he is safe from the law, but he is an abusive scoundrel; and instead of applying to my Lord Chief Justice to punish him, I would send half a dozen footmen and have him well ducked.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The notion of liberty amuses the people of England, and helps to keep off the <span class="t8">tædium vitæ</span>. When a butcher tells you that <span class="t8">his heart bleeds for his country</span>, he has, in fact, no uneasy feeling.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Sheridan will not succeed at Bath with his oratory. Ridicule has gone down before him, and, I doubt, Derrick is his enemy.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Derrick may do very well, as long as he can outrun his character; but the moment his character gets up with him, it is all over.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">It is, however, but just to record, that some years afterwards, when I reminded him of this sarcasm, he said, &lsquo;Well, but Derrick has now got a character that he need not run away from.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I was highly pleased with the extraordinary vigour of his conversation, and regretted that I was drawn away from it by an engagement at another place. I had, for a part of the evening, been left alone with him, and had ventured to make an observation now and then, which he received very civilly; so that I was satisfied that though there was a roughness in his manner, there was no ill-nature in his disposition. Davies followed me to the door, and when I complained to him a little of the hard blows which the great man had given me, he kindly took upon him to console me by saying, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be uneasy. I can see he likes you very well.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">A few days afterwards I called on Davies, and asked him if he thought I might take the liberty of waiting on Mr. Johnson at his Chambers in the Temple. He said I certainly might, and that Mr. Johnson would take it as a compliment. So upon Tuesday the 24th of May, after having been enlivened by the witty sallies of Messieurs Thornton, Wilkes, Churchill and Lloyd, with whom I had passed the morning, I boldly repaired to Johnson. His Chambers were on the first floor of No. 1, Inner-Temple-lane, and I entered them with an impression given me by the Reverend Dr. Blair, of Edinburgh, who had been introduced to him not long before, and described his having &lsquo;found the Giant in his den;&rsquo; an expression, which, when I came to be pretty well acquainted with Johnson, I repeated to him, and he was diverted at this picturesque account of himself. Dr. Blair had been presented to him by Dr. James Fordyce. At this time the controversy concerning the pieces published by Mr. James Macpherson, as translations of Ossian, was at its height. Johnson had all along denied their authenticity; and, what was still more provoking to their admirers, maintained that they had no merit. The subject having been introduced by Dr. Fordyce, Dr. Blair, relying on the internal evidence of their antiquity, asked Dr. Johnson whether he thought any man of a modern age could have written such poems? Johnson replied, &lsquo;Yes, Sir, many men, many women, and many children.&rsquo; Johnson, at this time, did not know that Dr. Blair had just published a <span class="t8">Dissertation</span>, not only defending their authenticity, but seriously ranking them with the poems of <span class="t8">Homer</span> and <span class="t8">Virgil</span>; and when he was afterwards informed of this circumstance, he expressed some displeasure at Dr. Fordyce&rsquo;s having suggested the topick, and said, &lsquo;I am not sorry that they got thus much for their pains. Sir, it was like leading one to talk of a book when the authour is concealed behind the door.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He received me very courteously; but, it must be confessed, that his apartment, and furniture, and morning dress, were sufficiently uncouth. His brown suit of cloaths looked very rusty; he had on a little old shrivelled unpowdered wig, which was too small for his head; his shirt-neck and knees of his breeches were loose; his black worsted stockings ill drawn up; and he had a pair of unbuckled shoes by way of slippers. But all these slovenly particularities were forgotten the moment that he began to talk. Some gentlemen, whom I do not recollect, were sitting with him; and when they went away, I also rose; but he said to me, &lsquo;Nay, don&rsquo;t go.&rsquo; &lsquo;Sir, (said I,) I am afraid that I intrude upon you. It is benevolent to allow me to sit and hear you.&rsquo; He seemed pleased with this compliment, which I sincerely paid him, and answered, &lsquo;Sir, I am obliged to any man who visits me.&rsquo; I have preserved the following short minute of what passed this day: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Madness frequently discovers itself merely by unnecessary deviation from the usual modes of the world. My poor friend Smart shewed the disturbance of his mind, by falling upon his knees, and saying his prayers in the street, or in any other unusual place. Now although, rationally speaking, it is greater madness not to pray at all, than to pray as Smart did, I am afraid there are so many who do not pray, that their understanding is not called in question.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Concerning this unfortunate poet, Christopher Smart, who was confined in a mad-house, he had, at another time, the following conversation with Dr. Burney: &mdash; BURNEY. &lsquo;How does poor Smart do, Sir; is he likely to recover?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;It seems as if his mind had ceased to struggle with the disease; for he grows fat upon it.&rsquo; BURNEY. &lsquo;Perhaps, Sir, that may be from want of exercise.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;No, Sir; he has partly as much exercise as he used to have, for he digs in the garden. Indeed, before his confinement, he used for exercise to walk to the ale-house; but he was <span class="t8">carried</span> back again. I did not think he ought to be shut up. His infirmities were not noxious to society. He insisted on people praying with him; and I&rsquo;d as lief pray with Kit Smart as any one else. Another charge was, that he did not love clean linen; and I have no passion for it.&rsquo; &mdash; Johnson continued. &lsquo;Mankind have a great aversion to intellectual labour; but even supposing knowledge to be easily attainable, more people would be content to be ignorant than would take even a little trouble to acquire it.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The morality of an action depends on the motive from which we act. If I fling half a crown to a beggar with intention to break his head, and he picks it up and buys victuals with it, the physical effect is good; but, with respect to me, the action is very wrong. So, religious exercises, if not performed with an intention to please GOD, avail us nothing. As our Saviour says of those who perform them from other motives, &ldquo;Verily they have their reward.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The Christian religion has very strong evidences. It, indeed, appears in some degree strange to reason; but in History we have undoubted facts, against which, reasoning <span class="t8">à priori</span>, we have more arguments than we have for them; but then, testimony has great weight, and casts the balance. I would recommend to every man whose faith is yet unsettled, Grotius, &mdash; Dr. Pearson, &mdash; and Dr. Clarke.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Talking of Garrick, he said, &lsquo;He is the first man in the world for sprightly conversation.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">When I rose a second time he again pressed me to stay, which I did.</p>
<p class="p24">He told me, that he generally went abroad at four in the afternoon, and seldom came home till two in the morning. I took the liberty to ask if he did not think it wrong to live thus, and not make more use of his great talents. He owned it was a bad habit. On reviewing, at the distance of many years, my journal of this period, I wonder how, at my first visit, I ventured to talk to him so freely, and that he bore it with so much indulgence.</p>
<p class="p24">Before we parted, he was so good as to promise to favour me with his company one evening at my lodgings; and, as I took my leave, shook me cordially by the hand. It is almost needless to add, that I felt no little elation at having now so happily established an acquaintance of which I had been so long ambitious.</p>
<p class="p24">My readers will, I trust, excuse me for being thus minutely circumstantial, when it is considered that the acquaintance of Dr. Johnson was to me a most valuable acquisition, and laid the foundation of whatever instruction and entertainment they may receive from my collections concerning the great subject of the work which they are now perusing.</p>
<p class="p24">I did not visit him again till Monday, June 13, at which time I recollect no part of his conversation, except that when I told him I had been to see Johnson ride upon three horses, he said, &lsquo;Such a man, Sir, should be encouraged; for his performances shew the extent of the human powers in one instance, and thus tend to raise our opinion of the faculties of man. He shews what may be attained by persevering application; so that every man may hope, that by giving as much application, although perhaps he may never ride three horses at a time, or dance upon a wire, yet he may be equally expert in whatever profession he has chosen to pursue.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He again shook me by the hand at parting, and asked me why I did not come oftener to him. Trusting that I was now in his good graces, I answered, that he had not given me much encouragement, and reminded him of the check I had received from him at our first interview. &lsquo;Poh, poh! (said he, with a complacent smile,) never mind these things. Come to me as often as you can. I shall be glad to see you.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I had learnt that his place of frequent resort was the Mitre tavern in Fleet-street, where he loved to sit up late, and I begged I might be allowed to pass an evening with him there soon, which he promised I should. A few days afterwards I met him near Temple-bar, about one o&rsquo;clock in the morning, and asked if he would then go to the Mitre. &lsquo;Sir, (said he) it is too late; they won&rsquo;t let us in. But I&rsquo;ll go with you another night with all my heart.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">A revolution of some importance in my plan of life had just taken place; for instead of procuring a commission in the footguards, which was my own inclination, I had, in compliance with my father&rsquo;s wishes, agreed to study the law; and was soon to set out for Utrecht, to hear the lectures of an excellent Civilian in that University, and then to proceed on my travels. Though very desirous of obtaining Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s advice and instructions on the mode of pursuing my studies, I was at this time so occupied, shall I call it? or so dissipated, by the amusements of London, that our next meeting was not till Saturday, June 25, when happening to dine at Clifton&rsquo;s eating-house, in Butcher-row, I was surprized to perceive Johnson come in and take his seat at another table. The mode of dining, or rather being fed, at such houses in London, is well known to many to be particularly unsocial, as there is no Ordinary, or united company, but each person has his own mess, and is under no obligation to hold any intercourse with any one. A liberal and full-minded man, however, who loves to talk, will break through this churlish and unsocial restraint. Johnson and an Irish gentleman got into a dispute concerning the cause of some part of mankind being black. &lsquo;Why, Sir, said (Johnson,) it has been accounted for in three ways: either by supposing that they are the posterity of Ham, who was cursed; or that GOD at first created two kinds of men, one black and another white; or that by the heat of the sun the skin is scorched, and so acquires a sooty hue. This matter has been much canvassed among naturalists, but has never been brought to any certain issue.&rsquo; What the Irishman said is totally obliterated from my mind; but I remember that he became very warm and intemperate in his expressions; upon which Johnson rose, and quietly walked away. When he had retired, his antagonist took his revenge, as he thought, by saying, &lsquo;He has a most ungainly figure, and an affectation of pomposity, unworthy of a man of genius.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson had not observed that I was in the room. I followed him, however, and he agreed to meet me in the evening at the Mitre. I called on him, and we went thither at nine. We had a good supper, and port wine, of which he then sometimes drank a bottle. The orthodox high-church sound of the MITRE, &mdash; the figure and manner of the celebrated SAMUEL JOHNSON, &mdash; the extraordinary power and precision of his conversation, and the pride arising from finding myself admitted as his companion, produced a variety of sensations, and a pleasing elevation of mind beyond what I had ever before experienced. I find in my journal the following minute of our conversation, which, though it will give but a very faint notion of what passed, is in some degree a valuable record; and it will be curious in this view, as shewing how habitual to his mind were some opinions which appear in his works.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Colley Cibber, Sir, was by no means a blockhead; but by arrogating to himself too much, he was in danger of losing that degree of estimation to which he was entitled. His friends gave out that he <span class="t8">intended</span> his birth-day <span class="t8">Odes</span> should be bad: but that was not the case, Sir; for he kept them many months by him, and a few years before he died he shewed me one of them, with great solicitude to render it as perfect as might be, and I made some corrections, to which he was not very willing to submit. I remember the following couplet in allusion to the King and himself:</p>
<p class="p26">&ldquo;Perch&rsquo;d on the eagle&rsquo;s soaring wing,<br/>The lowly linnet loves to sing.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Sir, he had heard something of the fabulous tale of the wren sitting upon the eagle&rsquo;s wing, and he had applied it to a linnet. Gibber&rsquo;s familiar style, however, was better than that which Whitehead has assumed. <span class="t8">Grand</span> nonsense is insupportable. Whitehead is but a little man to inscribe verses to players.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I did not presume to controvert this censure, which was tinctured with his prejudice against players; but I could not help thinking that a dramatick poet might with propriety pay a compliment to an eminent performer, as Whitehead has very happily done in his verses to Mr. Garrick.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Sir, I do not think Gray a first-rate poet. He has not a bold imagination, nor much command of words. The obscurity in which he has involved himself will not persuade us that he is sublime. His <span class="t8">Elegy in a Church-yard</span> has a happy selection of images, but I don&rsquo;t like what are called his great things. His <span class="t8">Ode</span> which begins</p>
<p class="p26">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rdquo;Ruin seize thee, ruthless King,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Confusion on thy banners wait!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">has been celebrated for its abruptness, and plunging into the subject all at once. But such arts as these have no merit, unless when they are original. We admire them only once; and this abruptness has nothing new in it. We have had it often before. Nay, we have it in the old song of Johnny Armstrong:</p>
<p class="p26">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rdquo;Is there ever a man in all Scotland<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the highest estate to the lowest degree, &amp;c.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">And then, Sir,</p>
<p class="p26">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rdquo;Yes, there is a man in Westmoreland,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Johnny Armstrong they do him call.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">There, now, you plunge at once into the subject. You have no previous narration to lead you to it. The two next lines in that <span class="t8">Ode</span> are, I think, very good:</p>
<p class="p26">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rdquo;Though fann&rsquo;d by conquest&rsquo;s crimson wing,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They mock the air with idle state.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Here let it be observed, that although his opinion of Gray&rsquo;s poetry was widely different from mine, and I believe from that of most men of taste, by whom it is with justice highly admired, there is certainly much absurdity in the clamour which has been raised, as if he had been culpably injurious to the merit of that bard, and had been actuated by envy. Alas! ye little short-sighted criticks, could JOHNSON be envious of the talents of any of his contemporaries? That his opinion on this subject was what in private and in publick he uniformly expressed, regardless of what others might think, we may wonder, and perhaps regret; but it is shallow and unjust to charge him with expressing what he did not think.</p>
<p class="p24">Finding him in a placid humour, and wishing to avail myself of the opportunity which I fortunately had of consulting a sage, to hear whose wisdom, I conceived in the ardour of youthful imagination, that men filled with a noble enthusiasm for intellectual improvement would gladly have resorted from distant lands; &mdash; I opened my mind to him ingenuously, and gave him a little sketch of my life, to which he was pleased to listen with great attention.</p>
<p class="p24">I acknowledged, that though educated very strictly in the principles of religion, I had for some time been misled into a certain degree of infidelity; but that I was come now to a better way of thinking, and was fully satisfied of the truth of the Christian revelation, though I was not clear as to every point considered to be orthodox. Being at all times a curious examiner of the human mind, and pleased with an undisguised display of what had passed in it, he called to me with warmth, &lsquo;Give me your hand; I have taken a liking to you.&rsquo; He then began to descant upon the force of testimony, and the little we could know of final causes; so that the objections of, why was it so? or why was it not so? ought not to disturb us: adding, that he himself had at one period been guilty of a temporary neglect of religion, but that it was not the result of argument, but mere absence of thought.</p>
<p class="p24">After having given credit to reports of his bigotry, I was agreeably surprized when he expressed the following very liberal sentiment, which has the additional value of obviating an objection to our holy religion, founded upon the discordant tenets of Christians themselves: &lsquo;For my part, Sir, I think all Christians, whether Papists or Protestants, agree in the essential articles, and that their differences are trivial, and rather political than religious.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">We talked of belief in ghosts. He said, &lsquo;Sir, I make a distinction between what a man may experience by the mere strength of his imagination, and what imagination cannot possibly produce. Thus, suppose I should think that I saw a form, and heard a voice cry &ldquo;Johnson, you are a very wicked fellow, and unless you repent you will certainly be punished;&rdquo; my own unworthiness is so deeply impressed upon my mind, that I might <span class="t8">imagine</span> I thus saw and heard, and therefore I should not believe that an external communication had been made to me. But if a form should appear, and a voice should tell me that a particular man had died at a particular place, and a particular hour, a fact which I had no apprehension of, nor any means of knowing, and this fact, with all its circumstances, should afterwards be unquestionably proved, I should, in that case, be persuaded that I had supernatural intelligence imparted to me.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Here it is proper, once for all, to give a true and fair statement of Johnson&rsquo;s way of thinking upon the question, whether departed spirits are ever permitted to appear in this world, or in any way to operate upon human life. He has been ignorantly misrepresented as weakly credulous upon that subject; and, therefore, though I feel an inclination to disdain and treat with silent contempt so foolish a notion concerning my illustrious friend, yet as I find it has gained ground, it is necessary to refute it. The real fact then is, that Johnson had a very philosophical mind, and such a rational respect for testimony, as to make him submit his understanding to what was authentically proved, though he could not comprehend why it was so. Being thus disposed, he was willing to inquire into the truth of any relation of supernatural agency, a general belief of which has prevailed in all nations and ages. But so far was he from being the dupe of implicit faith, that he examined the matter with a jealous attention, and no man was more ready to refute its falsehood when he had discovered it. Churchill, in his poem entitled <span class="t8">The Ghost</span>, availed himself of the absurd credulity imputed to Johnson, and drew a caricature of him under the name of &lsquo;POMPOSO,&rsquo; representing him as one of the believers of the story of a Ghost in Cock-lane, which, in the year 1762, had gained very general credit in London. Many of my readers, I am convinced, are to this hour under an impression that Johnson was thus foolishly deceived. It will therefore surprise them a good deal when they are informed upon undoubted authority, that Johnson was one of those by whom the imposture was detected. The story had become so popular, that he thought it should be investigated; and in this research he was assisted by the Reverend Dr. Douglas, now Bishop of Salisbury, the great detector of impostures; who informs me, that after the gentlemen who went and examined into the evidence were satisfied of its falsity, Johnson wrote in their presence an account of it, which was published in the newspapers and <span class="t8">Gentleman&rsquo;s Magazine</span>, and undeceived the world.</p>
<p class="p24">Our conversation proceeded. &lsquo;Sir, (said he) I am a friend to subordination, as most conducive to the happiness of society. There is a reciprocal pleasure in governing and being governed.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Dr. Goldsmith is one of the first men we now have as an authour, and he is a very worthy man too. He has been loose in his principles, but he is coming right.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I mentioned Mallet&rsquo;s tragedy of <span class="t8">Elvira</span>, which had been acted the preceding winter at Drury-lane, and that the Honourable Andrew Erskine, Mr. Dempster, and myself, had joined in writing a pamphlet, entitled, <span class="t8">Critical Strictures</span>, against it. That the mildness of Dempster&rsquo;s disposition had, however, relented; and he had candidly said, &lsquo;We have hardly a right to abuse this tragedy: for bad as it is, how vain should either of us be to write one not near so good.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why no, Sir; this is not just reasoning. You may abuse a tragedy, though you cannot write one. You may scold a carpenter who has made you a bad table, though you cannot make a table. It is not your trade to make tables.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">When I talked to him of the paternal estate to which I was heir, he said, &lsquo;Sir, let me tell you, that to be a Scotch landlord, where you have a number of families dependent upon you, and attached to you, is, perhaps, as high a situation as humanity can arrive at. A merchant upon the &rsquo;Change of London, with a hundred thousand pounds, is nothing; an English Duke, with an immense fortune, is nothing; he has no tenants who consider themselves as under his patriarchal care, and who will follow him to the field upon an emergency.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">His notion of the dignity of a Scotch landlord had been formed upon what he had heard of the Highland Chiefs; for it is long since a lowland landlord has been so curtailed in his feudal authority, that he has little more influence over his tenants than an English landlord; and of late years most of the Highland Chiefs have destroyed, by means too well known, the princely power which they once enjoyed.</p>
<p class="p24">He proceeded: &lsquo;Your going abroad, Sir, and breaking off idle habits, may be of great importance to you. I would go where there are courts and learned men. There is a good deal of Spain that has not been perambulated. I would have you go thither. A man of inferiour talents to yours may furnish us with useful observations upon that country.&rsquo; His supposing me, at that period of life, capable of writing an account of my travels that would deserve to be read, elated me not a little.</p>
<p class="p24">I appeal to every impartial reader whether this faithful detail of his frankness, complacency, and kindness to a young man, a stranger and a Scotchman, does not refute the unjust opinion of the harshness of his general demeanour. His occasional reproofs of folly, impudence, or impiety, and even the sudden sallies of his constitutional irritability of temper, which have been preserved for the poignancy of their wit, have produced that opinion among those who have not considered that such instances, though collected by Mrs. Piozzi into a small volume, and read over in a few hours, were, in fact, scattered through a long series of years; years, in which his time was chiefly spent in instructing and delighting mankind by his writings and conversation, in acts of piety to GOD, and good-will to men.</p>
<p class="p24">I complained to him that I had not yet acquired much knowledge, and asked his advice as to my studies. He said, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t talk of study now. I will give you a plan; but it will require some time to consider of it.&rsquo; &lsquo;It is very good in you (I replied,) to allow me to be with you thus. Had it been foretold to me some years ago that I should pass an evening with the authour of <span class="t8">The Rambler</span>, how should I have exulted!&rsquo; What I then expressed, was sincerely from the heart. He was satisfied that it was, and cordially answered, &lsquo;Sir, I am glad we have met. I hope we shall pass many evenings and mornings too, together.&rsquo; We finished a couple of bottles of port, and sat till between one and two in the morning.</p>
<p class="p24">He wrote this year in the <span class="t8">Critical Review</span> the account of &lsquo;Telemachus, a Mask,&rsquo; by the Reverend George Graham, of Eton College. The subject of this beautiful poem was particularly interesting to Johnson, who had much experience of &lsquo;the conflict of opposite principles,&rsquo; which he describes as &lsquo;The contention between pleasure and virtue, a struggle which will always be continued while the present system of nature shall subsist: nor can history or poetry exhibit more than pleasure triumphing over virtue, and virtue subjugating pleasure.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">As Dr. Oliver Goldsmith will frequently appear in this narrative, I shall endeavour to make my readers in some degree acquainted with his singular character. He was a native of Ireland, and a contemporary with Mr. Burke at Trinity College, Dublin, but did not then give much promise of future celebrity. He, however, observed to Mr. Malone, that &lsquo;though he made no great figure in mathematicks, which was a study in much repute there, he could turn an Ode of Horace into English better than any of them.&rsquo; He afterwards studied physick at Edinburgh, and upon the Continent; and I have been informed, was enabled to pursue his travels on foot, partly by demanding at Universities to enter the lists as a disputant, by which, according to the custom of many of them, he was entitled to the premium of a crown, when luckily for him his challenge was not accepted; so that, as I once observed to Dr. Johnson, he <span class="t8">disputed</span> his passage through Europe. He then came to England, and was employed successively in the capacities of an usher to an academy, a corrector of the press, a reviewer, and a writer for a news-paper. He had sagacity enough to cultivate assiduously the acquaintance of Johnson, and his faculties were gradually enlarged by the contemplation of such a model. To me and many others it appeared that he studiously copied the manner of Johnson, though, indeed, upon a smaller scale.</p>
<p class="p24">At this time I think he had published nothing with his name, though it was pretty generally known that <span class="t8">one Dr. Goldsmith</span> was the authour of <span class="t8">An Enquiry into the present State of polite Learning in Europe</span>, and of <span class="t8">The Citizen of the World</span>, a series of letters supposed to be written from London by a Chinese. No man had the art of displaying with more advantage as a writer, whatever literary acquisitions he made. &lsquo;<span class="t8">Nihil quod tetigit non ornavit</span>&rsquo;. His mind resembled a fertile, but thin soil. There was a quick, but not a strong vegetation, of whatever chanced to be thrown upon it. No deep root could be struck. The oak of the forest did not grow there; but the elegant shrubbery and the fragrant parterre appeared in gay succession. It has been generally circulated and believed that he was a mere fool in conversation; but, in truth, this has been greatly exaggerated.</p>
<p class="p24">He had, no doubt, a more than common share of that hurry of ideas which we often find in his countrymen, and which sometimes produces a laughable confusion in expressing them. He was very much what the French call <span class="t8">un etourdi</span>, and from vanity and an eager desire of being conspicuous wherever he was, he frequently talked carelessly without knowledge of the subject, or even without thought. His person was short, his countenance coarse and vulgar, his deportment that of a scholar awkwardly affecting the easy gentleman. Those who were in any way distinguished, excited envy in him to so ridiculous an excess, that the instances of it are hardly credible. When accompanying two beautiful young ladies with their mother on a tour in France, he was seriously angry that more attention was paid to them than to him; and once at the exhibition of the <span class="t8">Fantoccini</span> in London, when those who sat next him observed with what dexterity a puppet was made to toss a pike, he could not bear that it should have such praise, and exclaimed with some warmth, &lsquo;Pshaw! I can do it better myself.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He, I am afraid, had no settled system of any sort, so that his conduct must not be strictly scrutinised; but his affections were social and generous, and when he had money he gave it away very liberally. His desire of imaginary consequence predominated over his attention to truth. When he began to rise into notice, he said he had a brother who was Dean of Durham, a fiction so easily detected, that it is wonderful how he should have been so inconsiderate as to hazard it. He boasted to me at this time of the power of his pen in commanding money, which I believe was true in a certain degree, though in the instance he gave he was by no means correct. He told me that he had sold a novel for four hundred pounds. This was his <span class="t8">Vicar of Wakefield</span>. But Johnson informed me, that he had made the bargain for Goldsmith, and the price was sixty pounds. &lsquo;And, Sir, (said he,) a sufficient price too, when it was sold; for then the fame of Goldsmith had not been elevated, as it afterwards was, by his <span class="t8">Traveller</span>; and the bookseller had such faint hopes of profit by his bargain, that he kept the manuscript by him a long time, and did not publish it till after <span class="t8">The Traveller</span> had appeared. Then, to be sure, it was accidentally worth more money.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Mrs. Piozzi and Sir John Hawkins have strangely mis-stated the history of Goldsmith&rsquo;s situation and Johnson&rsquo;s friendly interference, when this novel was sold. I shall give it authentically from Johnson&rsquo;s own exact narration:&mdash; &lsquo;I received one morning a message from poor Goldsmith that he was in great distress, and as it was not in his power to come to me, begging that I would come to him as soon as possible. I sent him a guinea, and promised to come to him directly. I accordingly went as soon as I was drest, and found that his landlady had arrested him for his rent, at which he was in a violent passion. I perceived that he had already changed my guinea, and had got a bottle of Madeira and a glass before him. I put the cork into the bottle, desired he would be calm, and began to talk to him of the means by which he might be extricated. He then told me that he had a novel ready for the press, which he produced to me. I looked into it, and saw its merit; told the landlady I should soon return, and having gone to a bookseller, sold it for sixty pounds. I brought Goldsmith the money, and he discharged his rent, not without rating his landlady in a high tone for having used him so ill.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">My next meeting with Johnson was on Friday the 1st of July, when he and I and Dr. Goldsmith supped together at the Mitre. I was before this time pretty well acquainted with Goldsmith, who was one of the brightest ornaments of the Johnsonian school. Goldsmith&rsquo;s respectful attachment to Johnson was then at its height; for his own literary reputation had not yet distinguished him so much as to excite a vain desire of competition with his great Master. He had increased my admiration of the goodness of Johnson&rsquo;s heart, by incidental remarks in the course of conversation, such as, when I mentioned Mr. Levet, whom he entertained under his roof, &lsquo;He is poor and honest, which is recommendation enough to Johnson;&rsquo; and when I wondered that he was very kind to a man of whom I had heard a very bad character, &lsquo;He is now become miserable, and that insures the protection of Johnson.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Goldsmith attempted this evening to maintain, I suppose from an affectation of paradox, &lsquo;that knowledge was not desirable on its own account, for it often was a source of unhappiness.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, that knowledge may in some cases produce unhappiness, I allow. But, upon the whole, knowledge, <span class="t8">per se</span>, is certainly an object which every man would wish to attain, although, perhaps, he may not take the trouble necessary for attaining it.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Dr. John Campbell, the celebrated political and biographical writer, being mentioned, Johnson said, &lsquo;Campbell is a man of much knowledge, and has a good share of imagination. His <span class="t8">Herinipptis Redivivus</span> is very entertaining, as an account of the Hermetick philosophy, and as furnishing a curious history of the extravagancies of the human mind. If it were merely imaginary it would be nothing at all. Campbell is not always rigidly careful of truth in his conversation; but I do not believe there is any thing of this carelessness in his books. Campbell is a good man, a pious man. I am afraid he has not been in the inside of a church for many years; but he never passes a church without pulling off his hat. This shews that he has good principles. I used to go pretty often to Campbell&rsquo;s on a Sunday evening till I began to consider that the shoals of Scotchmen who flocked about him might probably say, when any thing of mine was well done, &lsquo;Ay, ay, he has learnt this of CAWMELL!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He talked very contemptuously of Churchill&rsquo;s poetry, observing that &lsquo;it had a temporary currency, only from its audacity of abuse, and being filled with living names, and that it would sink into oblivion.&rsquo; I ventured to hint that he was not quite a fair judge, as Churchill had attacked him violently. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Nay, Sir, I am a very fair judge. He did not attack me violently till he found I did not like his poetry; and his attack on me shall not prevent me from continuing to say what I think of him, from an apprehension that it may be ascribed to resentment. No, Sir, I called the fellow a blockhead at first, and I will call him a blockhead still. However, I will acknowledge that I have a better opinion of him now, than I once had; for he has shewn more fertility than I expected. To be sure, he is a tree that cannot produce good fruit: he only bears crabs. But, Sir, a tree that produces a great many crabs is better than a tree which produces only a few.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">In this depreciation of Churchill&rsquo;s poetry I could not agree with him. It is very true that the greatest part of it is upon the topicks of the day, on which account, as it brought him great fame and profit at the time, it must proportionally slide out of the publick attention as other occasional objects succeed. But Churchill had extraordinary vigour both of thought and expression. His portraits of the players will ever be valuable to the true lovers of the drama; and his strong caricatures of several eminent men of his age, will not be forgotten by the curious. Let me add, that there are in his works many passages which are of a general nature; and his <span class="t8">Prophecy of Famine</span> is a poem of no ordinary merit. It is, indeed, falsely injurious to Scotland, but therefore may be allowed a greater share of invention.</p>
<p class="p24">Bonnell Thornton had just published a burlesque <span class="t8">Ode on St. Cecilia&rsquo;s day, adapted to the ancient British musick, viz. the salt-box, the Jew&rsquo;s-harp, the marrow-bones and cleaver, the humstrum or hurdy-gurdy, &amp;c</span>. Johnson praised its humour, and seemed much diverted with it. He repeated the following passage: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;In strains more exalted the salt-box shall join,<br/>And clattering and battering and clapping combine;<br/>With a rap and a tap while the hollow side sounds,<br/>Up and down leaps the flap, and with rattling rebounds.</p>
<p class="p24">I mentioned the periodical paper called <span class="t8">The Connoisseur</span>. He said it wanted matter. &mdash; No doubt it has not the deep thinking of Johnson&rsquo;s writings. But surely it has just views of the surface of life, and a very sprightly manner. His opinion of <span class="t8">The World</span> was not much higher than of the <span class="t8">Connoisseur</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">Let me here apologize for the imperfect manner in which I am obliged to exhibit Johnson&rsquo;s conversation at this period. In the early part of my acquaintance with him, I was so wrapt in admiration of his extraordinary colloquial talents, and so little accustomed to his peculiar mode of expression, that I found it extremely difficult to recollect and record his conversation with its genuine vigour and vivacity. In progress of time, when my mind was, as it were, <span class="t8">strongly impregnated &mdash; with the Johnsonian æther</span>, I could, with much more facility and exactness, carry in my memory and commit to paper the exuberant variety of his wisdom and wit.</p>
<p class="p24">At this time <span class="t8">Miss</span> Williams, as she was then called, though she did not reside with him in the Temple under his roof, but had lodgings in Bolt-court, Fleet-street, had so much of his attention, that he every night drank tea with her before he went home, however late it might be, and she always sat up for him. This, it may be fairly conjectured, was not alone a proof of his regard for <span class="t8">her</span>, but of his own unwillingness to go into solitude, before that unseasonable hour at which he had habituated himself to expect the oblivion of repose. Dr. Goldsmith, being a privileged man, went with him this night, strutting away, and calling to me with an air of superiority, like that of an esoterick over an exoterick disciple of a sage of antiquity, &lsquo;I go to Miss Williams.&rsquo; I confess, I then envied him this mighty privilege, of which he seemed so proud; but it was not long before I obtained the same mark of distinction.</p>
<p class="p24">On Tuesday the 5th of July, I again visited Johnson. He told me he had looked into the poems of a pretty voluminous writer, Mr. (now Dr.) John Ogilvie, one of the Presbyterian ministers of Scotland, which had lately come out, but could find no thinking in them. BOSWELL. &lsquo;Is there not imagination in them, Sir?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, there is in them what <span class="t8">was</span> imagination, but it is no more imagination in <span class="t8">him</span>, than sound is sound in the echo. And his diction too is not his own. We have long ago seen <span class="t8">white-robed innocence</span>, and <span class="t8">flower-bespangled meads</span>.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Talking of London, he observed, &lsquo;Sir, if you wish to have a just notion of the magnitude of this city, you must not be satisfied with seeing its great streets and squares, but must survey the innumerable little lanes and courts. It is not in the showy evolutions of buildings, but in the multiplicity of human habitations which are crouded together, that the wonderful immensity of London consists.&rsquo; &mdash; I have often amused myself with thinking how different a place London is to different people. They, whose narrow minds are contracted to the consideration of some one particular pursuit, view it only through that medium. A politician thinks of it merely as the seat of government in its different departments; a grazier, as a vast market for cattle; a mercantile man, as a place where a prodigious deal of business is done upon &rsquo;Change; a dramatick enthusiast, as the grand scene of theatrical entertainments; a man of pleasure, as an assemblage of taverns, and the great emporium for ladies of easy virtue. But the intellectual man is struck with it, as comprehending the whole of human life in all its variety, the contemplation of which is inexhaustible.</p>
<p class="p24">On Wednesday, July 6, he was engaged to sup with me at my lodgings in Downing-street, Westminster. But on the preceding night my landlord having behaved very rudely to me and some company who were with me, I had resolved not to remain another night in his house. I was exceedingly uneasy at the aukward appearance I supposed I should make to Johnson and the other gentlemen whom I had invited, not being able to receive them at home, and being obliged to order supper at the Mitre. I went to Johnson in the morning, and talked of it as a serious distress. He laughed, and said, &lsquo;Consider, Sir, how insignificant this will appear a twelvemonth hence.&rsquo; &mdash; Were this consideration to be applied to most of the little vexatious incidents of life, by which our quiet is too often disturbed, it would prevent many painful sensations. I have tried it frequently, with good effect. &lsquo;There is nothing (continued he) in this mighty misfortune; nay, we shall be better at the Mitre.&rsquo; I told him that I had been at Sir John Fielding&rsquo;s office, complaining of my landlord, and had been informed, that though I had taken my lodgings for a year, I might, upon proof of his bad behaviour, quit them when I pleased, without being under an obligation to pay rent for any longer time than while I possessed them. The fertility of Johnson&rsquo;s mind could shew itself even upon so small a matter as this. &lsquo;Why, Sir, (said he,) I suppose this must be the law, since you have been told so in Bow-street. But, if your landlord could hold you to your bargain, and the lodgings should be yours for a year, you may certainly use them as you think fit. So, Sir, you may quarter two life-guardsmen upon him; or you may send the greatest scoundrel you can find into your apartments; or you may say that you want to make some experiments in natural philosophy, and may burn a large quantity of assafoetida in his house.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I had as my guests this evening at the Mitre tavern, Dr. Johnson, Dr. Goldsmith, Mr. Thomas Davies, Mr. Eccles, an Irish gentleman, for whose agreeable company I was obliged to Mr. Davies, and the Reverend Mr. John Ogilvie, who was desirous of being in company with my illustrious friend, while I, in my turn, was proud to have the honour of shewing one of my countrymen upon what easy terms Johnson permitted me to live with him.</p>
<p class="p24">Goldsmith, as usual, endeavoured, with too much eagerness, to <span class="t8">shine</span>, and disputed very warmly with Johnson against the well-known maxim of the British constitution, &lsquo;the King can do no wrong;&rsquo; affirming, that &lsquo;what was morally false could not be politically true; and as the King might, in the exercise of his regal power, command and cause the doing of what was wrong, it certainly might be said, in sense and in reason, that he could do wrong.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, you are to consider, that in our constitution, according to its true principles, the King is the head; he is supreme; he is above every thing, and there is no power by which he can be tried. Therefore, it is, Sir, that we hold the King can do no wrong; that whatever may happen to be wrong in government may not be above our reach, by being ascribed to Majesty. Redress is always to be had against oppression, by punishing the immediate agents. The King, though he should command, cannot force a Judge to condemn a man unjustly; therefore it is the Judge whom we prosecute and punish. Political institutions are formed upon the consideration of what will most frequently tend to the good of the whole, although now and then exceptions may occur. Thus it is better in general that a nation should have a supreme legislative power, although it may at times be abused. And then, Sir, there is this consideration, that <span class="t8">if the abuse be enormous, Nature will rise up, and claiming her original rights, overturn a corrupt political system</span>.&rsquo; I mark this animated sentence with peculiar pleasure, as a noble instance of that truly dignified spirit of freedom which ever glowed in his heart, though he was charged with slavish tenets by superficial observers; because he was at all times indignant against that false patriotism, that pretended love of freedom, that unruly restlessness, which is inconsistent with the stable authority of any good government.</p>
<p class="p24">This generous sentiment, which he uttered with great fervour, struck me exceedingly, and stirred my blood to that pitch of fancied resistance, the possibility of which I am glad to keep in mind, but to which I trust I never shall be forced.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Great abilities (said he) are not requisite for an Historian; for in historical composition, all the greatest powers of the human mind are quiescent. He has facts ready to his hand; so there is no exercise of invention. Imagination is not required in any high degree; only about as much as is used in the lower kinds of poetry. Some penetration, accuracy, and colouring will fit a man for the task, if he can give the application which is necessary.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Bayle&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Dictionary</span> is a very useful work for those to consult who love the biographical part of literature, which is what I love most.&rsquo; </p>
<p class="p24">Talking of the eminent writers in Queen Anne&rsquo;s reign, he observed, &lsquo;I think Dr. Arbuthnot the first man among them. He was the most universal genius, being an excellent physician, a man of deep learning, and a man of much humour. Mr. Addison was, to be sure, a great man; his learning was not profound; but his morality, his humour, and his elegance of writing, set him very high.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Mr. Ogilvie was unlucky enough to choose for the topick of his conversation the praises of his native country. He began with saying, that there was very rich land round Edinburgh. Goldsmith, who had studied physick there, contradicted this, very untruly, with a sneering laugh. Disconcerted a little by this, Mr. Ogilvie then took new ground, where, I suppose, he thought himself perfectly safe; for he observed, that Scotland had a great many noble wild prospects. JOHNSON. &lsquo;I believe, Sir, you have a great many. Norway, too, has noble wild prospects; and Lapland is remarkable for prodigious noble wild prospects. But, Sir, let me tell you, the noblest prospect which a Scotchman ever sees, is the high road that leads him to England!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">This unexpected and pointed sally produced a roar of applause. After all, however, those, who admire the rude grandeur of Nature, cannot deny it to Caledonia.</p>
<p class="p24">On Saturday, July 9, I found Johnson surrounded with a numerous levee, but have not preserved any part of his conversation. On the 14th we had another evening by ourselves at the Mitre. It happening to be a very rainy night, I made some common-place observations on the relaxation of nerves and depression of spirits which such weather occasioned; adding, however, that it was good for the vegetable creation. Johnson, who, as we have already seen, denied that the temperature of the air had any influence on the human frame, answered, with a smile of ridicule, &lsquo;Why yes, Sir, it is good for vegetables, and for the animals who eat those vegetables, and for the animals who eat those animals.&rsquo; This observation of his aptly enough introduced a good supper; and I soon forgot, in Johnson&rsquo;s company, the influence of a moist atmosphere.</p>
<p class="p24">Feeling myself now quite at ease as his companion, though I had all possible reverence for him, I expressed a regret that I could not be so easy with my father, though he was not much older than Johnson, and certainly however respectable had not more learning and greater abilities to depress me. I asked him the reason of this. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, I am a man of the world. I live in the world, and I take, in some degree, the colour of the world as it moves along. Your father is a Judge in a remote part of the island, and all his notions are taken from the old world. Besides, Sir, there must always be a struggle between a father and son, while one aims at power and the other at independence.&rsquo; I said, I was afraid my father would force me to be a lawyer. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, you need not be afraid of his forcing you to be a laborious practising lawyer; that is not in his power. For as the proverb says, &ldquo;One man may lead a horse to the water, but twenty cannot make him drink.&rdquo; He may be displeased that you are not what he wishes you to be; but that displeasure will not go far. If he insists only on your having as much law as is necessary for a man of property, and then endeavours to get you into Parliament, he is quite in the right.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He enlarged very convincingly upon the excellence of rhyme over blank verse in English poetry. I mentioned to him that Dr. Adam Smith, in his lectures upon composition, when I studied under him in the College of Glasgow, had maintained the same opinion strenuously, and I repeated some of his arguments. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, I was once in company with Smith, and we did not take to each other; but had I known that he loved rhyme as much as you tell me he does, I should have HUGGED him.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Talking of those who denied the truth of Christianity, he said, &lsquo;It is always easy to be on the negative side. If a man were now to deny that there is salt upon the table, you could not reduce him to an absurdity. Come, let us try this a little further. I deny that Canada is taken, and I can support my denial by pretty good arguments. The French are a much more numerous people than we; and it is not likely that they would allow us to take it. &ldquo;But the ministry have assured us, in all the formality of <span class="t8">The Gazette</span>, that it is taken.&rdquo; &mdash; Very true. But the ministry have put us to an enormous expence by the war in America, and it is their interest to persuade us that we have got something for our money.&mdash; &ldquo;But the fact is confirmed by thousands of men who were at the taking of it.&rdquo; &mdash; Ay, but these men have still more interest in deceiving us. They don&rsquo;t want that you should think the French have beat them, but that they have beat the French. Now suppose you should go over and find that it is really taken, that would only satisfy yourself; for when you come home we will not believe you. We will say, you have been bribed. &mdash; Yet, Sir, notwithstanding all these plausible objections, we have no doubt that Canada is really ours. Such is the weight of common testimony. How much stronger are the evidences of the Christian religion!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Idleness is a disease which must be combated; but I would not advise a rigid adherence to a particular plan of study. I myself have never persisted in any plan for two days together. A man ought to read just as inclination leads him; for what he reads as a task will do him little good. A young man should read five hours in a day, and so may acquire a great deal of knowledge.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">To a man of vigorous intellect and arduous curiosity like his own, reading without a regular plan may be beneficial; though even such a man must submit to it, if he would attain a full understanding of any of the sciences.</p>
<p class="p24">To such a degree of unrestrained frankness had he now accustomed me, that in the course of this evening I talked of the numerous reflections which had been thrown out against him on account of his having accepted a pension from his present Majesty. &lsquo;Why, Sir, (said he, with a hearty laugh,) it is a mighty foolish noise that they make. I have accepted of a pension as a reward which has been thought due to my literary merit; and now that I have this pension, I am the same man in every respect that I have ever been; I retain the same principles. It is true, that I cannot now curse (smiling) the House of Hanover; nor would it be decent for me to drink King James&rsquo;s health in the wine that King George gives me money to pay for. But, Sir, I think that the pleasure of cursing the House of Hanover, and drinking King James&rsquo;s health, are amply overbalanced by three hundred pounds a year.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">There was here, most certainly, an affectation of more Jacobitism than he really had; and indeed an intention of admitting, for the moment, in a much greater extent than it really existed, the charge of disaffection imputed to him by the world, merely for the purpose of shewing how dexterously he could repel an attack, even though he were placed in the most disadvantageous position; for I have heard him declare, that if holding up his right hand would have secured victory at Culloden to Prince Charles&rsquo;s army, he was not sure he would have held it up; so little confidence had he in the right claimed by the house of Stuart, and so fearful was he of the consequences of another revolution on the throne of Great-Britain; and Mr. Topham Beauclerk assured me, he had heard him say this before he had his pension. At another time he said to Mr. Langton, &lsquo;Nothing has ever offered, that has made it worth my while to consider the question fully.&rsquo; He, however, also said to the same gentleman, talking of King James the Second, &lsquo;It was become impossible for him to reign any longer in this country.&rsquo; He no doubt had an early attachment to the House of Stuart; but his zeal had cooled as his reason strengthened. Indeed I heard him once say, that &lsquo;after the death of a violent Whig, with whom he used to contend with great eagerness, he felt his Toryism much abated.&rsquo; I suppose he meant Mr. Walmsley. </p>
<p class="p24">Yet there is no doubt that at earlier periods he was wont often to exercise both his pleasantry and ingenuity in talking Jacobitism. My much respected friend, Dr. Douglas, now Bishop of Salisbury, has favoured me with the following admirable instance from his Lordship&rsquo;s own recollection. One day when dining at old Mr. Langton&rsquo;s where Miss Roberts, his niece, was one of the company, Johnson, with his usual complacent attention to the fair sex, took her by the hand and said, &lsquo;My dear, I hope you are a Jacobite.&rsquo; Old Mr. Langton, who, though a high and steady Tory, was attached to the present Royal Family, seemed offended, and asked Johnson, with great warmth, what he could mean by putting such a question to his niece? &lsquo;Why, Sir, (said Johnson) I meant no offence to your niece, I meant her a great compliment. A Jacobite, Sir, believes in the divine right of Kings. He that believes in the divine right of Kings believes in a Divinity. A Jacobite believes in the divine right of Bishops. He that believes in the divine right of Bishops believes in the divine authority of the Christian religion. Therefore, Sir, a Jacobite is neither an Atheist nor a Deist. That cannot be said of a Whig; for <span class="t8">Whiggism is a negation of all principle</span>.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He advised me, when abroad, to be as much as I could with the Professors in the Universities, and with the Clergy; for from their conversation I might expect the best accounts of every thing in whatever country I should be, with the additional advantage of keeping my learning alive.</p>
<p class="p24">It will be observed, that when giving me advice as to my travels, Dr. Johnson did not dwell upon cities, and palaces, and pictures, and shows, and Arcadian scenes. He was of Lord Essex&rsquo;s opinion, who advises his kinsman Roger Earl of Rutland, &lsquo;rather to go an hundred miles to speak with one wise man, than five miles to see a fair town.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I described to him an impudent fellow from Scotland, who affected to be a savage, and railed at all established systems. JOHNSON. &lsquo;There is nothing surprizing in this, Sir. He wants to make himself conspicuous. He would tumble in a hogstye, as long as you looked at him and called to him to come out. But let him alone, never mind him, and he&rsquo;ll soon give it over.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I added, that the same person maintained that there was no distinction between virtue and vice. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, if the fellow does not think as he speaks, he is lying; and I see not what honour he can propose to himself from having the character of a lyar. But if he does really think that there is no distinction between virtue and vice, why, Sir, when he leaves our houses let us count our spoons.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Sir David Dalrymple, now one of the Judges of Scotland by the title of Lord Hailes, had contributed much to increase my high opinion of Johnson, on account of his writings, long before I attained to a personal acquaintance with him; I, in return, had informed Johnson of Sir David&rsquo;s eminent character for learning and religion; and Johnson was so much pleased, that at one of our evening meetings he gave him for his toast. I at this time kept up a very frequent correspondence with Sir David; and I read to Dr. Johnson to-night the following passage from the letter which I had last received from him: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;It gives me pleasure to think that you have obtained the friendship of Mr. Samuel Johnson. He is one of the best moral writers which England has produced. At the same time, I envy you the free and undisguised converse with such a man. May I beg you to present my best respects to him, and to assure him of the veneration which I entertain for the authour of the <span class="t8">Rambler</span> and of <span class="t8">Rasselas</span>? Let me recommend this last work to you; with the <span class="t8">Rambler</span> you certainly are acquainted. In <span class="t8">Rasselas</span> you will see a tender-hearted operator, who probes the wound only to heal it. Swift, on the contrary, mangles human nature. He cuts and slashes, as if he took pleasure in the operation, like the tyrant who said, <span class="t8">Ita feri ut se sentiat emori</span>.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson seemed to be much gratified by this just and well-turned compliment.</p>
<p class="p24">He recommended to me to keep a journal of my life, full and unreserved. He said it would be a very good exercise, and would yield me great satisfaction when the particulars were faded from my remembrance. I was uncommonly fortunate in having had a previous coincidence of opinion with him upon this subject, for I had kept such a journal for some time; and it was no small pleasure to me to have this to tell him, and to receive his approbation. He counselled me to keep it private, and said I might surely have a friend who would burn it in case of my death. From this habit I have been enabled to give the world so many anecdotes, which would otherwise have been lost to posterity. I mentioned that I was afraid I put into my journal too many little incidents. JOHNSON. &lsquo;There is nothing, Sir, too little for so little a creature as man. It is by studying little things that we attain the great art of having as little misery and as much happiness as possible.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Next morning Mr. Dempster happened to call on me, and was so much struck even with the imperfect account which I gave him of Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s conversation, that to his honour be it recorded, when I complained that drinking port and sitting up late with him affected my nerves for some time after, he said, &lsquo;One had better be palsied at eighteen than not keep company with such a man.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Tuesday, July 18, I found tall Sir Thomas Robinson sitting with Johnson. Sir Thomas said, that the king of Prussia valued himself upon three things; &mdash; upon being a hero, a musician, and an authour. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Pretty well, Sir, for one man. As to his being an authour, I have not looked at his poetry; but his prose is poor stuff. He writes just as you might suppose Voltaire&rsquo;s footboy to do, who has been his amanuensis. He has such parts as the valet might have, and about as much of the colouring of the style as might be got by transcribing his works.&rsquo; When I was at Ferney, I repeated this to Voltaire, in order to reconcile him somewhat to Johnson, whom he, in affecting the English mode of expression, had previously characterised as &lsquo;a superstitious dog;&rsquo; but after hearing such a criticism on Frederick the Great, with whom he was then on bad terms, he exclaimed, &lsquo;An honest fellow!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">But I think the criticism much too severe; for the <span class="t8">Memoirs of the House of Brandenburgh</span> are written as well as many works of that kind. His poetry, for the style of which he himself makes a frank apology, &lsquo;<span class="t8">Jargonnant un François barbare</span>,&rsquo; though fraught with pernicious ravings of infidelity, has, in many places, great animation, and in some a pathetick tenderness.</p>
<p class="p24">Upon this contemptuous animadversion on the King of Prussia, I observed to Johnson, &lsquo;It would seem then, Sir, that much less parts are necessary to make a King, than to make an Authour; for the King of Prussia is confessedly the greatest King now in Europe, yet you think he makes a very poor figure as an Authour.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Mr. Levet this day shewed me Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s library, which was contained in two garrets over his Chambers, where Lintot, son of the celebrated bookseller of that name, had formerly his warehouse. I found a number of good books, but very dusty and in great confusion. The floor was strewed with manuscript leaves, in Johnson&rsquo;s own hand-writing, which I beheld with a degree of veneration, supposing they perhaps might contain portions of <span class="t8">The Rambler</span> or of <span class="t8">Rasselas</span>. I observed an apparatus for chymical experiments, of which Johnson was all his life very fond. The place seemed to be very favourable for retirement and meditation. Johnson told me, that he went up thither without mentioning it to his servant, when he wanted to study, secure from interruption; for he would not allow his servant to say he was not at home when he really was. &lsquo;A servant&rsquo;s strict regard for truth, (said he) must be weakened by such a practice. A philosopher may know that it is merely a form of denial; but few servants are such nice distinguishers. If I accustom a servant to tell a lie for <span class="t8">me</span>, have I not reason to apprehend that he will tell many lies for <span class="t8">himself</span>.&rsquo; I am, however, satisfied that every servant, of any degree of intelligence, understands saying his master is not at home, not at all as the affirmation of a fact, but as customary words, intimating that his master wishes not to be seen; so that there can be no bad effect from it.</p>
<p class="p24">Mr. Temple, now vicar of St. Gluvias, Cornwall, who had been my intimate friend for many years, had at this time chambers in Farrar&rsquo;s-buildings, at the bottom of Inner Temple-lane, which he kindly lent me upon my quitting my lodgings, he being to return to Trinity Hall, Cambridge. I found them particularly convenient for me, as they were so near Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s.</p>
<p class="p24">On Wednesday, July 20, Dr. Johnson, Mr. Dempster, and my uncle Dr. Boswell, who happened to be now in London, supped with me at these Chambers. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Pity is not natural to man. Children are always cruel. Savages are always cruel. Pity is acquired and improved by the cultivation of reason. We may have uneasy sensations from seeing a creature in distress, without pity; for we have not pity unless we wish to relieve them. When I am on my way to dine with a friend, and finding it late, have bid the coachman make haste, if I happen to attend when he whips his horses, I may feel unpleasantly that the animals are put to pain, but I do not wish him to desist. No, Sir, I wish him to drive on.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Mr. Alexander Donaldson, bookseller of Edinburgh, had for some time opened a shop in London, and sold his cheap editions of the most popular English books, in defiance of the supposed common-law right of <span class="t8">Literary Property</span>. Johnson, though he concurred in the opinion which was afterwards sanctioned by a judgement of the House of Lords, that there was no such right, was at this time very angry that the Booksellers of London, for whom he uniformly professed much regard, should suffer from an invasion of what they had ever considered to be secure: and he was loud and violent against Mr. Donaldson. &lsquo;He is a fellow who takes advantage of the law to injure his brethren; for, notwithstanding that the statute secures only fourteen years of exclusive right, it has always been understood by <span class="t8">the trade</span>, that he, who buys the copyright of a book from the authour, obtains a perpetual property; and upon that belief, numberless bargains are made to transfer that property after the expiration of the statutory term. Now Donaldson, I say, takes advantage here, of people who have really an equitable title from usage; and if we consider how few of the books, of which they buy the property, succeed so well as to bring profit, we should be of opinion that the term of fourteen years is too short; it should be sixty years.&rsquo; DEMPSTER. &lsquo;Donaldson, Sir, is anxious for the encouragement of literature. He reduces the price of books, so that poor students may buy them.&rsquo; JOHNSON, (laughing) &lsquo;Well, Sir, allowing that to be his motive, he is no better than Robin Hood, who robbed the rich in order to give to the poor.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">It is remarkable, that when the great question concerning Literary Property came to be ultimately tried before the supreme tribunal of this country, in consequence of the very spirited exertions of Mr. Donaldson, Dr. Johnson was zealous against a perpetuity; but he thought that the term of the exclusive right of authours should be considerably enlarged. He was then for granting a hundred years.</p>
<p class="p24">The conversation now turned upon Mr. David Hume&rsquo;s style. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, his style is not English; the structure of his sentences is French. Now the French structure and the English structure may, in the nature of things, be equally good. But if you allow that the English language is established, he is wrong. My name might originally have been Nicholson, as well as Johnson; but were you to call me Nicholson now, you would call me very absurdly.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Rousseau&rsquo;s treatise on the inequality of mankind was at this time a fashionable topick. It gave rise to an observation by Mr. Dempster, that the advantages of fortune and rank were nothing to a wise man, who ought to value only merit. JOHNSON. &lsquo;If man were a savage, living in the woods by himself, this might be true; but in civilized society we all depend upon each other, and our happiness is very much owing to the good opinion of mankind. Now, Sir, in civilized society, external advantages make us more respected. A man with a good coat upon his back meets with a better reception than he who has a bad one.</p>
<p class="p24">Sir, you may analyse this, and say what is there in it? But that will avail you nothing, for it is a part of a general system. Pound St. Paul&rsquo;s Church into atoms, and consider any single atom; it is, to be sure, good for nothing: but, put all these atoms together, and you have St. Paul&rsquo;s Church. So it is with human felicity, which is made up of many ingredients, each of which may be shewn to be very insignificant. In civilized society, personal merit will not serve you so much as money will. Sir, you may make the experiment. Go into the street, and give one man a lecture on morality, and another a shilling, and see which will respect you most. If you wish only to support nature, Sir William Petty fixes your allowance at three pounds a year but as times are much altered, let us call it six pounds. This sum will fill your belly, shelter you from the weather, and even get you a strong lasting coat, supposing it to be made of good bull&rsquo;s hide. Now, Sir, all beyond this is artificial, and is desired in order to obtain a greater degree of respect from our fellow-creatures. And, Sir, if six hundred pounds a year procure a man more consequence, and, of course, more happiness than six pounds a year, the same proportion will hold as to six thousand, and so on as far as opulence can be carried. Perhaps he who has a large fortune may not be so happy as he who has a small one; but that must proceed from other causes than from his having the large fortune: for, <span class="t8">caeteris paribus</span>, he who is rich in a civilized society, must be happier than he who is poor; as riches, if properly used, (and it is a man&rsquo;s own fault if they are not,) must be productive of the highest advantages. Money, to be sure, of itself is of no use; for its only use is to part with it. Rousseau, and all those who deal in paradoxes, are led away by a childish desire of novelty. When I was a boy, I used always to choose the wrong side of a debate, because most ingenious things, that is to say, most new things, could be said upon it. Sir, there is nothing for which you may not muster up more plausible arguments, than those which are urged against wealth and other external advantages. Why, now, there is stealing; why should it be thought a crime? When we consider by what unjust methods property has been often acquired, and that what was unjustly got it must be unjust to keep, where is the harm in one man&rsquo;s taking the property of another from him? Besides, Sir, when we consider the bad use that many people make of their property, and how much better use the thief may make of it, it may be defended as a very allowable practice. Yet, Sir, the experience of mankind has discovered stealing to be so very bad a thing, that they make no scruple to hang a man for it. When I was running about this town a very poor fellow, I was a great arguer for the advantages of poverty; but I was, at the same time, very sorry to be poor. Sir, all the arguments which are brought to represent poverty as no evil, shew it to be evidently a great evil. You never find people labouring to convince you that you may live very happily upon a plentiful fortune. &mdash; So you hear people talking how miserable a King must be; and yet they all wish to be in his place.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">It was suggested that Kings must be unhappy, because they are deprived of the greatest of all satisfactions, easy and unreserved society. JOHNSON. &lsquo;That is an ill-founded notion. Being a King does not exclude a man from such society. Great Kings have always been social. The King of Prussia, the only great King at present, is very social. Charles the Second, the last King of England who was a man of parts, was social; and our Henrys and Edwards were all social.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Mr. Dempster having endeavoured to maintain that intrinsick merit <span class="t8">ought</span> to make the only distinction amongst mankind. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, mankind have found that this cannot be. How shall we determine the proportion of intrinsick merit? Were that to be the only distinction amongst mankind, we should soon quarrel about the degrees of it. Were all distinctions abolished, the strongest would not long acquiesce, but would endeavour to obtain a superiority by their bodily strength. But, Sir, as subordination is very necessary for society, and contensions for superiority very dangerous, mankind, that is to say, all civilized nations, have settled it upon a plain invariable principle. A man is born to hereditary rank; or his being appointed to certain offices, gives him a certain rank. Subordination tends greatly to human happiness. Were we all upon an equality, we should have no other enjoyment than mere animal pleasure.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I said, I considered distinction of rank to be of so much importance in civilised society, that if I were asked on the same day to dine with the first Duke in England, and with the first man in Britain for genius, I should hesitate which to prefer. JOHNSON. &lsquo;To be sure, Sir, if you were to dine only once, and it were never to be known where you dined, you would choose rather to dine with the first man for genius; but to gain most respect, you should dine with the first Duke in England. For nine people in ten that you meet with, would have a higher opinion of you for having dined with a Duke; and the great genius himself would receive you better, because you had been with the great Duke.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He took care to guard himself against any possible suspicion that his settled principles of reverence for rank and respect for wealth were at all owing to mean or interested motives; for he asserted his own independence as a literary man. &lsquo;No man (said he) who ever lived by literature, has lived more independently than I have done.&rsquo; He said he had taken longer time than he needed to have done in composing his <span class="t8">Dictionary</span>. He received our compliments upon that great work with complacency, and told us that the Academy <span class="t8">della Crusca</span> could scarcely believe that it was done by one man.</p>
<p class="p24">Next morning I found him alone, and have preserved the following fragments of his conversation. Of a gentleman who was mentioned, he said, &lsquo;I have not met with any man for a long time who has given me such general displeasure. He is totally unfixed in his principles, and wants to puzzle other people. I said his principles had been poisoned by a noted infidel writer, but that he was, nevertheless, a benevolent good man. JOHNSON. &lsquo;We can have no dependance upon that instinctive, that constitutional goodness which is not founded upon principle. I grant you that such a man may be a very amiable member of society. I can conceive him placed in such a situation that he is not much tempted to deviate from what is right; and as every man prefers virtue, when there is not some strong incitement to transgress its precepts, I can conceive him doing nothing wrong. But if such a man stood in need of money, I should not like to trust him; and I should certainly not trust him with young ladies, for <span class="t8">there</span> there is always temptation. Hume, and other sceptical innovators, are vain men, and will gratify themselves at any expence. Truth will not afford sufficient food to their vanity; so they have betaken themselves to errour. Truth, Sir, is a cow which will yield such people no more milk, and so they are gone to milk the bull. If I could have allowed myself to gratify my vanity at the expence of truth, what fame might I have acquired. Every thing which Hume has advanced against Christianity had passed through my mind long before he wrote. Always remember this, that after a system is well settled upon positive evidence, a few partial objections ought not to shake it. The human mind is so limited, that it cannot take in all the parts of a subject, so that there may be objections raised against any thing. There are objections against a <span class="t8">plenum</span>, and objections against a <span class="t8">vacuum</span>; yet one of them must certainly be true.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I mentioned Hume&rsquo;s argument against the belief of miracles, that it is more probable that the witnesses to the truth of them are mistaken, or speak falsely, than that the miracles should be true. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, the great difficulty of proving miracles should make us very cautious in believing them. But let us consider; although GOD has made Nature to operate by certain fixed laws, yet it is not unreasonable to think that he may suspend those laws, in order to establish a system highly advantageous to mankind. Now the Christian religion is a most beneficial system, as it gives us light and certainty where we were before in darkness and doubt. The miracles which prove it are attested by men who had no interest in deceiving us; but who, on the contrary, were told that they should suffer persecution, and did actually lay down their lives in confirmation of the truth of the facts which they asserted. Indeed, for some centuries the heathens did not pretend to deny the miracles; but said they were performed by the aid of evil spirits. This is a circumstance of great weight. Then, Sir, when we take the proofs derived from prophecies which have been so exactly fulfilled, we have most satisfactory evidence. Supposing a miracle possible, as to which, in my opinion, there can be no doubt, we have as strong evidence for the miracles in support of Christianity, as the nature of the thing admits.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">At night Mr. Johnson and I supped in a private room at the Turk&rsquo;s Head coffee-house, in the Strand. &lsquo;I encourage this house (said he;) for the mistress of it is a good civil woman, and has not much business.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Sir, I love the acquaintance of young people; because, in the first place, I don&rsquo;t like to think myself growing old. In the next place, young acquaintances must last longest, if they do last; and then, Sir, young men have more virtue than old men; they have more generous sentiments in every respect. I love the young dogs of this age: they have more wit and humour and knowledge of life than we had; but then the dogs are not so good scholars, Sir, in my early years I read very hard. It is a sad reflection, but a true one, that I knew almost as much at eighteen as I do now. My judgement, to be sure, was not so good; but I had all the facts. I remember very well, when I was at Oxford, an old gentleman said to me, &ldquo;Young man, ply your book diligently now, and acquire a stock of knowledge; for when years come upon you, you will find that poring upon books will be but an irksome task.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">This account of his reading, given by himself in plain words, sufficiently confirms what I have already advanced upon the disputed question as to his application. It reconciles any seeming inconsistency in his way of talking upon it at different times; and shews that idleness and reading hard were with him relative terms, the import of which, as used by him, must be gathered from a comparison with what scholars of different degrees of ardour and assiduity have been known to do. And let it be remembered, that he was now talking spontaneously, and expressing his genuine sentiments; whereas at other times he might be induced from his spirit of contradiction, or more properly from his love of argumentative contest, to speak lightly of his own application to study. It is pleasing to consider that the old gentleman&rsquo;s gloomy prophecy as to the irksomeness of books to men of an advanced age, which is too often fulfilled, was so far from being verified in Johnson, that his ardour for literature never failed, and his last writings had more ease and vivacity than any of his earlier productions.</p>
<p class="p24">He mentioned to me now, for the first time, that he had been distrest by melancholy, and for that reason had been obliged to fly from study and meditation, to the dissipating variety of life. Against melancholy he recommended constant occupation of mind, a great deal of exercise, moderation in eating and drinking, and especially to shun drinking at night. He said melancholy people were apt to fly to intemperance for relief, but that it sunk them much deeper in misery. He observed, that labouring men who work hard, and live sparingly, are seldom or never troubled with low spirits.</p>
<p class="p24">He again insisted on the duty of maintaining subordination of rank. &lsquo;Sir, I would no more deprive a nobleman of his respect, than of his money. I consider myself as acting a part in the great system of society, and I do to others as I would have them to do to me. I would behave to a nobleman as I should expect he would behave to me, were I a nobleman and he Sam. Johnson. Sir, there is one Mrs. Macaulay in this town, a great republican. One day when I was at her house, I put on a very grave countenance, and said to her, &ldquo;Madam, I am now become a convert to your way of thinking. I am convinced that all mankind are upon an equal footing; and to give you an unquestionable proof, Madam, that I am in earnest, here is a very sensible, civil, well-behaved fellow-citizen, your footman; I desire that he may be allowed to sit down and dine with us.&rdquo; I thus, Sir, shewed her the absurdity of the levelling doctrine. She has never liked me since. Sir, your levellers wish to level <span class="t8">down</span> as far as themselves; but they cannot bear levelling <span class="t8">up</span> to themselves. They would all have some people under them; why not then have some people above them?&rsquo; I mentioned a certain authour who disgusted me by his forwardness, and by shewing no deference to noblemen into whose company he was admitted. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Suppose a shoemaker should claim an equality with him, as he does with a Lord; how he would stare. &ldquo;Why, Sir, do you stare? (says the shoemaker,) I do great service to society. &rsquo;Tis true I am paid for doing it; but so are you, Sir: and I am sorry to say it, paid better than I am, for doing something not so necessary. For mankind could do better without your books, than without my shoes.&rdquo; Thus, Sir, there would be a perpetual struggle for precedence, were there no fixed invariable rules for the distinction of rank, which creates no jealousy, as it is allowed to be accidental.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He said, Dr. Joseph Warton was a very agreeable man, and his <span class="t8">Essay on the Genius and Writings of Pope</span>, a very pleasing book. I wondered that he delayed so long to give us the continuation of it. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, I suppose he finds himself a little disappointed, in not having been able to persuade the world to be of his opinion as to Pope.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">We have now been favoured with the concluding volume, in which, to use a parliamentary expression, he has <span class="t8">explained</span>, so as not to appear quite so adverse to the opinion of the world, concerning Pope, as was at first thought; and we must all agree that his work is a most valuable accession to English literature.</p>
<p class="p24">A writer of deserved eminence being mentioned, Johnson said, &lsquo;Why, Sir, he is a man of good parts, but being originally poor, he has got a love of mean company and low jocularity; a very bad thing, Sir. To laugh is good, as to talk is good. But you ought no more to think it enough if you laugh, than you are to think it enough if you talk. You may laugh in as many ways as you talk; and surely <span class="t8">every</span> way of talking that is practised cannot be esteemed.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I spoke of Sir James Macdonald as a young man of most distinguished merit, who united the highest reputation at Eaton and Oxford, with the patriarchal spirit of a great Highland Chieftain. I mentioned that Sir James had said to me, that he had never seen Mr. Johnson, but he had a great respect for him, though at the same time it was mixed with some degree of terrour. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, if he were to be acquainted with me, it might lessen both.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">The mention of this gentleman led us to talk of the Western Islands of Scotland, to visit which he expressed a wish that then appeared to me a very romantick fancy, which I little thought would be afterwards realised. He told me, that his father had put Martin&rsquo;s account of those islands into his hands when he was very young, and that he was highly pleased with it; that he was particularly struck with the St. Kilda man&rsquo;s notion that the high church of Glasgow had been hollowed out of a rock; a circumstance to which old Mr. Johnson had directed his attention. He said he would go to the Hebrides with me, when I returned from my travels, unless some very good companion should offer when I was absent, which he did not think probable; adding, &lsquo;There are few people to whom I take so much to as you.&rsquo; And when I talked of my leaving England, he said with a very affectionate air, &lsquo;My dear Boswell, I should be very unhappy at parting, did I think we were not to meet again.&rsquo; I cannot too often remind my readers, that although such instances of his kindness are doubtless very flattering to me, yet I hope my recording them will be ascribed to a better motive than to vanity; for they afford unquestionable evidence of his tenderness and complacency, which some, while they were forced to acknowledge his great powers, have been so strenuous to deny.</p>
<p class="p24">He maintained that a boy at school was the happiest of human beings. I supported a different opinion, from which I have never yet varied, that a man is happier; and I enlarged upon the anxiety and sufferings which are endured at school. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Ah! Sir, a boy&rsquo;s being flogged is not so severe as a man&rsquo;s having the hiss of the world against him. Men have a solicitude about fame; and the greater share they have of it, the more afraid they are of losing it.&rsquo; I silently asked myself, &lsquo;Is it possible that the great SAMUEL JOHNSON really entertains any such apprehension, and is not confident that his exalted fame is established upon a foundation never to be shaken?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He this evening drank a bumper to Sir David Dalrymple, &lsquo;as a man of worth, a scholar, and a wit.&rsquo; &lsquo;I have (said he) never heard of him except from you; but let him know my opinion of him: for as he does not shew himself much in the world, he should have the praise of the few who hear of him.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Tuesday, July 26, I found Mr. Johnson alone. It was a very wet day, and I again complained of the disagreeable effects of such weather. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, this is all imagination, which physicians encourage; for man lives in air, as a fish lives in water; so that if the atmosphere press heavy from above, there is an equal resistance from below. To be sure, bad weather is hard upon people who are obliged to be abroad; and men cannot labour so well in the open air in bad weather, as in good: but, Sir, a smith or a taylor, whose work is within doors, will surely do as much in rainy weather, as in fair. Some very delicate frames, indeed, may be affected by wet weather; but not common constitutions.&rsquo; </p>
<p class="p24">We talked of the education of children; and I asked him what he thought was best to teach them first. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, it is no matter what you teach them first, any more than what leg you shall put into your breeches first. Sir, you may stand disputing which is best to put in first, but in the mean time your breech is bare. Sir, while you are considering which of two things you should teach your child first, another boy has learnt them both.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Thursday, July 28, we again supped in private at the Turk&rsquo;s Head coffee-house. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Swift has a higher reputation than he deserves. His excellence is strong sense; for his humour, though very well, is not remarkably good. I doubt whether <span class="t8">The Tale of a Tub</span> be his; for he never owned it, and it is much above his usual manner.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;Thompson, I think, had as much of the poet about him as most writers.<br/>Every thing appeared to him through the medium of his favourite pursuit.<br/>He could not have viewed those two candles burning but with a poetical<br/>eye.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Has not &mdash;&mdash; a great deal of wit, Sir?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;I do not think so, Sir. He is, indeed, continually attempting wit, but he fails. And I have no more pleasure in hearing a man attempting wit and failing, than in seeing a man trying to leap over a ditch and tumbling into it.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He laughed heartily, when I mentioned to him a saying of his concerning Mr. Thomas Sheridan, which Foote took a wicked pleasure to circulate. &lsquo;Why, Sir, Sherry is dull, naturally dull; but it must have taken him a great deal of pains to become what we now see him. Such an excess of stupidity, Sir, is not in Nature.&rsquo; &lsquo;So (said he,) I allowed him all his own merit.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He now added, &lsquo;Sheridan cannot bear me. I bring his declamation to a point. I ask him a plain question, &lsquo;What do you mean to teach?&rsquo; Besides, Sir, what influence can Mr. Sheridan have upon the language of this great country, by his narrow exertions? Sir, it is burning a farthing candle at Dover, to shew light at Calais.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Talking of a young man who was uneasy from thinking that he was very deficient in learning and knowledge, he said, &lsquo;A man has no reason to complain who holds a middle place, and has many below him; and perhaps he has not six of his years above him; &mdash; perhaps not one. Though he may not know any thing perfectly, the general mass of knowledge that he has acquired is considerable. Time will do for him all that is wanting.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">The conversation then took a philosophical turn. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Human experience, which is constantly contradicting theory, is the great test of truth. A system, built upon the discoveries of a great many minds, is always of more strength, than what is produced by the mere workings of any one mind, which, of itself, can do little. There is not so poor a book in the world that would not be a prodigious effort were it wrought out entirely by a single mind, without the aid of prior investigators. The French writers are superficial; because they are not scholars, and so proceed upon the mere power of their own minds; and we see how very little power they have.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;As to the Christian religion, Sir, besides the strong evidence which we have for it, there is a balance in its favour from the number of great men who have been convinced of its truth, after a serious consideration of the question. Grotius was an acute man, a lawyer, a man accustomed to examine evidence, and he was convinced. Grotius was not a recluse, but a man of the world, who certainly had no bias to the side of religion. Sir Isaac Newton set out an infidel, and came to be a very firm believer.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He this evening again recommended to me to perambulate Spain. I said it would amuse him to get a letter from me dated at Salamancha. JOHNSON. &lsquo;I love the University of Salamancha; for when the Spaniards were in doubt as to the lawfulness of their conquering America, the University of Salamancha gave it as their opinion that it was not lawful.&rsquo; He spoke this with great emotion, and with that generous warmth which dictated the lines in his <span class="t8">London</span>, against Spanish encroachment.</p>
<p class="p24">I expressed my opinion of my friend Derrick as but a poor writer. JOHNSON. &lsquo;To be sure, Sir, he is; but you are to consider that his being a literary man has got for him all that he has. It has made him King of Bath. Sir, he has nothing to say for himself but that he is a writer. Had he not been a writer, he must have been sweeping the crossings in the streets, and asking halfpence from every body that past.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">In justice, however, to the memory of Mr. Derrick, who was my first tutor in the ways of London, and shewed me the town in all its variety of departments, both literary and sportive, the particulars of which Dr. Johnson advised me to put in writing, it is proper to mention what Johnson, at a subsequent period, said of him both as a writer and an editor: &lsquo;Sir, I have often said, that if Derrick&rsquo;s letters had been written by one of a more established name, they would have been thought very pretty letters.&rsquo; And, &lsquo;I sent Derrick to Dryden&rsquo;s relations to gather materials for his life; and I believe he got all that I myself should have got.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Poor Derrick! I remember him with kindness. Yet I cannot withhold from my readers a pleasant humourous sally which could not have hurt him had he been alive, and now is perfectly harmless. In his collection of poems, there is one upon entering the harbour of Dublin, his native city, after a long absence. It begins thus:</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;Eblana! much lov&rsquo;d city, hail!<br/>Where first I saw the light of day.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">And after a solemn reflection on his being &lsquo;numbered with forgotten dead,&rsquo; there is the following stanza:</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;Unless my lines protract my fame,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;And those, who chance to read them, cry,<br/>I knew him! Derrick was his name,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;In yonder tomb his ashes lie.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Which was thus happily parodied by Mr. John Home, to whom we owe the beautiful and pathetick tragedy of <span class="t8">Douglas</span>:</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;Unless my <span class="t8">deeds</span> protract my fame,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="t8">And he who passes sadly sings</span>,<br/>I knew him! Derrick was his name,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="t8">On yonder tree his carcase swings</span>!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I doubt much whether the amiable and ingenious author of these burlesque lines will recollect them, for they were produced extempore one evening while he and I were walking together in the dining-room at Eglintoune Castle, in 1760, and I have never mentioned them to him since.</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson said once to me, &lsquo;Sir, I honour Derrick for his presence of mind. One night, when Floyd, another poor authour, was wandering about the streets in the night, he found Derrick fast asleep upon a bulk; upon being suddenly waked, Derrick started up, &ldquo;My dear Floyd, I am sorry to see you in this destitute state; will you go home with me to <span class="t8">my lodgings</span>?&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I again begged his advice as to my method of study at Utrecht. &lsquo;Come, (said he) let us make a day of it. Let us go down to Greenwich and dine, and talk of it there.&rsquo; The following Saturday was fixed for this excursion.</p>
<p class="p24">As we walked along the Strand to-night, arm in arm, a woman of the town accosted us, in the usual enticing manner. &lsquo;No, no, my girl, (said Johnson) it won&rsquo;t do.&rsquo; He, however, did not treat her with harshness, and we talked of the wretched life of such women; and agreed, that much more misery than happiness, upon the whole, is produced by illicit commerce between the sexes.</p>
<p class="p24">On Saturday, July 30, Dr. Johnson and I took a sculler at the Temple-stairs, and set out for Greenwich. I asked him if he really thought a knowledge of the Greek and Latin languages an essential requisite to a good education. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Most certainly, Sir; for those who know them have a very great advantage over those who do not. Nay, Sir, it is wonderful what a difference learning makes upon people even in the common intercourse of life, which does not appear to be much connected with it.&rsquo; &lsquo;And yet, (said I) people go through the world very well, and carry on the business of life to good advantage, without learning.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, that may be true in cases where learning cannot possibly be of any use; for instance, this boy rows us as well without learning, as if he could sing the song of Orpheus to the Argonauts, who were the first sailors.&rsquo; He then called to the boy, &lsquo;What would you give, my lad, to know about the Argonauts?&rsquo; &lsquo;Sir (said the boy,) I would give what I have.&rsquo; Johnson was much pleased with his answer, and we gave him a double fare. Dr. Johnson then turning to me, &lsquo;Sir, (said he) a desire of knowledge is the natural feeling of mankind; and every human being, whose mind is not debauched, will be willing to give all that he has to get knowledge.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">We landed at the Old Swan, and walked to Billingsgate, where we took oars, and moved smoothly along the silver Thames. It was a very fine day. We were entertained with the immense number and variety of ships that were lying at anchor, and with the beautiful country on each side of the river.</p>
<p class="p24">I talked of preaching, and of the great success which those called Methodists have. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, it is owing to their expressing themselves in a plain and familiar manner, which is the only way to do good to the common people, and which clergymen of genius and learning ought to do from a principle of duty, when it is suited to their congregations; a practice, for which they will be praised by men of sense. To insist against drunkenness as a crime, because it debases reason, the noblest faculty of man, would be of no service to the common people: but to tell them that they may die in a fit of drunkenness, and shew them how dreadful that would be, cannot fail to make a deep impression. Sir, when your Scotch clergy give up their homely manner, religion will soon decay in that country.&rsquo; Let this observation, as Johnson meant it, be ever remembered.</p>
<p class="p24">I was much pleased to find myself with Johnson at Greenwich, which he celebrates in his <span class="t8">London</span> as a favourite scene. I had the poem in my pocket, and read the lines aloud with enthusiasm:</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;On Thames&rsquo;s banks in silent thought we stood:<br/>Where Greenwich smiles upon the silver flood:<br/>Pleas&rsquo;d with the seat which gave ELIZA birth,<br/>We kneel, and kiss the consecrated earth.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He remarked that the structure of Greenwich hospital was too magnificent for a place of charity, and that its parts were too much detached to make one great whole.</p>
<p class="p24">Buchanan, he said, was a very fine poet; and observed, that he was the first who complimented a lady, by ascribing to her the different perfections of the heathen goddesses; but that Johnston improved upon this, by making his lady, at the same time, free from their defects.</p>
<p class="p24">He dwelt upon Buchanan&rsquo;s elegant verses to Mary Queen of Scots, <span class="t8">Nympha Caledoniae</span>, &amp;c., and spoke with enthusiasm of the beauty of Latin verse. &lsquo;All the modern languages (said he) cannot furnish so melodious a line as</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Formosam resonare doces Amarillida silvas.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Afterwards he entered upon the business of the day, which was to give me his advice as to a course of study. And here I am to mention with much regret, that my record of what he said is miserably scanty. I recollect with admiration an animating blaze of eloquence, which rouzed every intellectual power in me to the highest pitch, but must have dazzled me so much, that my memory could not preserve the substance of his discourse; for the note which I find of it is no more than this:&mdash; &lsquo;He ran over the grand scale of human knowledge; advised me to select some particular branch to excel in, but to acquire a little of every kind.&rsquo; The defect of my minutes will be fully supplied by a long letter upon the subject which he favoured me with, after I had been some time at Utrecht, and which my readers will have the pleasure to peruse in its proper place.</p>
<p class="p24">We walked in the evening in Greenwich Park. He asked me, I suppose, by way of trying my disposition, &lsquo;Is not this very fine?&rsquo; Having no exquisite relish of the beauties of Nature, and being more delighted with &lsquo;the busy hum of men,&rsquo; I answered, &lsquo;Yes, Sir; but not equal to Fleet-street.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;You are right, Sir.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I am aware that many of my readers may censure my want of taste. Let me, however, shelter myself under the authority of a very fashionable Baronet in the brilliant world, who, on his attention being called to the fragrance of a May evening in the country, observed, &lsquo;This may be very well; but, for my part, I prefer the smell of a flambeau at the play-house.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">We staid so long at Greenwich, that our sail up the river, in our return to London, was by no means so pleasant as in the morning; for the night air was so cold that it made me shiver. I was the more sensible of it from having sat up all the night before, recollecting and writing in my journal what I thought worthy of preservation; an exertion, which, during the first part of my acquaintance with Johnson, I frequently made. I remember having sat up four nights in one week, without being much incommoded in the day time.</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson, whose robust frame was not in the least affected by the cold, scolded me, as if my shivering had been a paltry effeminacy, saying, &lsquo;Why do you shiver?&rsquo; Sir William Scott, of the Commons, told me, that when he complained of a headach in the post-chaise, as they were travelling together to Scotland, Johnson treated him in the same manner: &lsquo;At your age, Sir, I had no head-ach.&rsquo; It is not easy to make allowance for sensations in others, which we ourselves have not at the time. We must all have experienced how very differently we are affected by the complaints of our neighbours, when we are well and when we are ill. In full health, we can scarcely believe that they suffer much; so faint is the image of pain upon our imagination: when softened by sickness, we readily sympathize with the sufferings of others.</p>
<p class="p24">We concluded the day at the Turk&rsquo;s Head coffee-house very socially. He was pleased to listen to a particular account which I gave him of my family, and of its hereditary estate, as to the extent and population of which he asked questions, and made calculations; recommending, at the same time, a liberal kindness to the tenantry, as people over whom the proprietor was placed by Providence. He took delight in hearing my description of the romantick seat of my ancestors. &lsquo;I must be there, Sir, (said he) and we will live in the old castle; and if there is not a room in it remaining, we will build one.&rsquo; I was highly flattered, but could scarcely indulge a hope that Auchinleck would indeed be honoured by his presence, and celebrated by a description, as it afterwards was, in his <span class="t8">Journey to the Western Islands</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">After we had again talked of my setting out for Holland, he said, &lsquo;I must see thee out of England; I will accompany you to Harwich.&rsquo; I could not find words to express what I felt upon this unexpected and very great mark of his affectionate regard.</p>
<p class="p24">Next day, Sunday, July 31, I told him I had been that morning at a meeting of the people called Quakers, where I had heard a woman preach. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, a woman&rsquo;s preaching is like a dog&rsquo;s walking on his hinder legs. It is not done well; but you are surprized to find it done at all.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Tuesday, August 2 (the day of my departure from London having been fixed for the 5th,) Dr. Johnson did me the honour to pass a part of the morning with me at my Chambers. He said, that &lsquo;he always felt an inclination to do nothing.&rsquo; I observed, that it was strange to think that the most indolent man in Britain had written the most laborious work, <span class="t8">The English Dictionary</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">I mentioned an imprudent publication, by a certain friend of his, at an early period of life, and asked him if he thought it would hurt him. JOHNSON. &lsquo;No, Sir; not much. It may, perhaps, be mentioned at an election.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I had now made good my title to be a privileged man, and was carried by him in the evening to drink tea with Miss Williams, whom, though under the misfortune of having lost her sight, I found to be agreeable in conversation; for she had a variety of literature, and expressed herself well; but her peculiar value was the intimacy in which she had long lived with Johnson, by which she was well acquainted with his habits, and knew how to lead him on to talk.</p>
<p class="p24">After tea he carried me to what he called his walk, which was a long narrow paved court in the neighbourhood, overshadowed by some trees. There we sauntered a considerable time; and I complained to him that my love of London and of his company was such, that I shrunk almost from the thought of going away, even to travel, which is generally so much desired by young men. He roused me by manly and spirited conversation. He advised me, when settled in any place abroad, to study with an eagerness after knowledge, and to apply to Greek an hour every day; and when I was moving about, to read diligently the great book of mankind.</p>
<p class="p24">On Wednesday, August 3, we had our last social evening at the Turk&rsquo;s Head coffee-house, before my setting out for foreign parts. I had the misfortune, before we parted, to irritate him unintentionally. I mentioned to him how common it was in the world to tell absurd stories of him, and to ascribe to him very strange sayings. JOHNSON. &lsquo;What do they make me say, Sir?&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Why, Sir, as an instance very strange indeed, (laughing heartily as I spoke,) David Hume told me, you said that you would stand before a battery of cannon, to restore the Convocation to its full powers.&rsquo; Little did I apprehend that he had actually said this: but I was soon convinced of my errour; for, with a determined look, he thundered out &lsquo;And would I not, Sir? Shall the Presbyterian <span class="t8">Kirk</span> of Scotland have its General Assembly, and the Church of England be denied its Convocation?&rsquo; He was walking up and down the room while I told him the anecdote; but when he uttered this explosion of high-church zeal, he had come close to my chair, and his eyes flashed with indignation. I bowed to the storm, and diverted the force of it, by leading him to expatiate on the influence which religion derived from maintaining the church with great external respectability.</p>
<p class="p26">I must not omit to mention that he this year wrote <span class="t8">The Life of<br/>Ascham</span>[dagger], and the Dedication to the Earl of Shaftesbury[dagger],<br/>prefixed to the edition of that writer&rsquo;s English works, published by Mr.<br/>Bennet.</p>
<p class="p24">On Friday, August 5, we set out early in the morning in the Harwich stage coach. A fat elderly gentlewoman, and a young Dutchman, seemed the most inclined among us to conversation. At the inn where we dined, the gentlewoman said that she had done her best to educate her children; and particularly, that she had never suffered them to be a moment idle. JOHNSON. &lsquo;I wish, madam, you would educate me too; for I have been an idle fellow all my life.&rsquo; &lsquo;I am sure, Sir, (said she) you have not been idle.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Nay, Madam, it is very true; and that gentleman there (pointing to me,) has been idle. He was idle at Edinburgh. His father sent him to Glasgow, where he continued to be idle. He then came to London, where he has been very idle; and now he is going to Utrecht, where he will be as idle as ever.&rsquo; I asked him privately how he could expose me so. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Poh, poh! (said he) they knew nothing about you, and will think of it no more.&rsquo; In the afternoon the gentlewoman talked violently against the Roman Catholicks, and of the horrours of the Inquisition. To the utter astonishment of all the passengers but myself, who knew that he could talk upon any side of a question, he defended the Inquisition, and maintained, that &lsquo;false doctrine should be checked on its first appearance; that the civil power should unite with the church in punishing those who dared to attack the established religion, and that such only were punished by the Inquisition.&rsquo; He had in his pocket &lsquo;<span class="t8">Pomponius Mela de situ Orbis</span>,&rsquo; in which he read occasionally, and seemed very intent upon ancient geography. Though by no means niggardly, his attention to what was generally right was so minute, that having observed at one of the stages that I ostentatiously gave a shilling to the coachman, when the custom was for each passenger to give only six-pence, he took me aside and scolded me, saying that what I had done would make the coachman dissatisfied with all the rest of the passengers, who gave him no more than his due. This was a just reprimand; for in whatever way a man may indulge his generosity or his vanity in spending his money, for the sake of others he ought not to raise the price of any article for which there is a constant demand.</p>
<p class="p24">He talked of Mr. Blacklock&rsquo;s poetry, so far as it was descriptive of visible objects; and observed, that &lsquo;as its authour had the misfortune to be blind, we may be absolutely sure that such passages are combinations of what he has remembered of the works of other writers who could see. That foolish fellow, Spence, has laboured to explain philosophically how Blacklock may have done, by means of his own faculties, what it is impossible he should do. The solution, as I have given it, is plain. Suppose, I know a man to be so lame that he is absolutely incapable to move himself, and I find him in a different room from that in which I left him; shall I puzzle myself with idle conjectures, that, perhaps, his nerves have by some unknown change all at once become effective? No, Sir; it it clear how he got into a different room: he was <span class="t8">carried</span>.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Having stopped a night at Colchester, Johnson talked of that town with veneration, for having stood a siege for Charles the First. The Dutchman alone now remained with us. He spoke English tolerably well; and thinking to recommend himself to us by expatiating on the superiority of the criminal jurisprudence of this country over that of Holland, he inveighed against the barbarity of putting an accused person to the torture, in order to force a confession. But Johnson was as ready for this, as for the Inquisition. &lsquo;Why, Sir, you do not, I find, understand the law of your own country. The torture in Holland is considered as a favour to an accused person; for no man is put to the torture there, unless there is as much evidence against him as would amount to conviction in England. An accused person among you, therefore, has one chance more to escape punishment, than those who are tried among us.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">At supper this night he talked of good eating with uncommon satisfaction. &lsquo;Some people (said he,) have a foolish way of not minding, or pretending not to mind, what they eat. For my part, I mind my belly very studiously, and very carefully; for I look upon it, that he who does not mind his belly will hardly mind anything else.&rsquo; He now appeared to me <span class="t8">Jean Bull philosophe</span>, and he was, for the moment, not only serious but vehement. Yet I have heard him, upon other occasions, talk with great contempt of people who were anxious to gratify their palates; and the 206th number of his <span class="t8">Rambler</span> is a masterly essay against gulosity. His practice, indeed, I must acknowledge, may be considered as casting the balance of his different opinions upon this subject; for I never knew any man who relished good eating more than he did. When at table, he was totally absorbed in the business of the moment; his looks seemed rivetted to his plate; nor would he, unless when in very high company, say one word, or even pay the least attention to what was said by others, till he had satisfied his appetite, which was so fierce, and indulged with such intenseness, that while in the act of eating, the veins of his forehead swelled, and generally a strong perspiration was visible. To those whose sensations were delicate, this could not but be disgusting; and it was doubtless not very suitable to the character of a philosopher, who should be distinguished by self-command. But it must be owned, that Johnson, though he could be rigidly <span class="t8">abstemious</span>, was not a <span class="t8">temperate</span> man either in eating or drinking. He could refrain, but he could not use moderately. He told me, that he had fasted two days without inconvenience, and that he had never been hungry but once. They who beheld with wonder how much he eat upon all occasions when his dinner was to his taste, could not easily conceive what he must have meant by hunger; and not only was he remarkable for the extraordinary quantity which he eat, but he was, or affected to be, a man of very nice discernment in the science of cookery. He used to descant critically on the dishes which had been at table where he had dined or supped, and to recollect very minutely what he had liked. I remember, when he was in Scotland, his praising &lsquo;<span class="t8">Gordon&rsquo;s palates</span>&rsquo;, (a dish of palates at the Honourable Alexander Gordon&rsquo;s) with a warmth of expression which might have done honour to more important subjects. &lsquo;As for Maclaurin&rsquo;s imitation of a <span class="t8">made dish</span>, it was a wretched attempt.&rsquo; He about the same time was so much displeased with the performances of a nobleman&rsquo;s French cook, that he exclaimed with vehemence, &lsquo;I&rsquo;d throw such a rascal into the river;&rsquo; and he then proceeded to alarm a lady at whose house he was to sup, by the following manifesto of his skill: &lsquo;I, Madam, who live at a variety of good tables, am a much better judge of cookery, than any person who has a very tolerable cook, but lives much at home; for his palate is gradually adapted to the taste of his cook; whereas, Madam, in trying by a wider range, I can more exquisitely judge.&rsquo; When invited to dine, even with an intimate friend, he was not pleased if something better than a plain dinner was not prepared for him. I have heard him say on such an occasion, &lsquo;This was a good dinner enough, to be sure; but it was not a dinner to <span class="t8">ask</span> a man to.&rsquo; On the other hand, he was wont to express, with great glee, his satisfaction when he had been entertained quite to his mind. One day when we had dined with his neighbour and landlord in Bolt-court, Mr. Allen, the printer, whose old housekeeper had studied his taste in every thing, he pronounced this eulogy: &lsquo;Sir, we could not have had a better dinner had there been a <span class="t8">Synod of Cooks</span>.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">While we were left by ourselves, after the Dutchman had gone to bed, Dr. Johnson talked of that studied behaviour which many have recommended and practised. He disapproved of it; and said, &lsquo;I never considered whether I should be a grave man, or a merry man, but just let inclination, for the time, have its course.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He flattered me with some hopes that he would, in the course of the following summer, come over to Holland, and accompany me in a tour through the Netherlands.</p>
<p class="p24">I teized him with fanciful apprehensions of unhappiness. A moth having fluttered round the candle, and burnt itself, he laid hold of this little incident to admonish me; saying, with a sly look, and in a solemn but quiet tone, &lsquo;That creature was its own tormentor, and I believe its name was BOSWELL.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Next day we got to Harwich to dinner; and my passage in the packet-boat to Helvoetsluys being secured, and my baggage put on board, we dined at our inn by ourselves. I happened to say it would be terrible if he should not find a speedy opportunity of returning to London, and be confined to so dull a place. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t, Sir, accustom yourself to use big words for little matters. It would <span class="t8">not</span> be <span class="t8">terrible</span>, though I <span class="t8">were</span> to be detained some time here.&rsquo; The practice of using words of disproportionate magnitude, is, no doubt, too frequent every where; but, I think, most remarkable among the French, of which, all who have travelled in France must have been struck with innumerable instances.</p>
<p class="p24">We went and looked at the church, and having gone into it and walked up to the altar, Johnson, whose piety was constant and fervent, sent me to my knees, saying, &lsquo;Now that you are going to leave your native country, recommend yourself to the protection of your CREATOR and REDEEMER.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">After we came out of the church, we stood talking for some time together of Bishop Berkeley&rsquo;s ingenious sophistry to prove the non-existence of matter, and that every thing in the universe is merely ideal. I observed, that though we are satisfied his doctrine is not true, it is impossible to refute it. I never shall forget the alacrity with which Johnson answered, striking his foot with mighty force against a large stone, till he rebounded from it, &lsquo;I refute it <span class="t8">thus</span>.&rsquo; This was a stout exemplification of the <span class="t8">first truths of Pere Bouffier</span>, or the <span class="t8">original principles</span> of Reid and of Beattie; without admitting which, we can no more argue in metaphysicks, than we can argue in mathematicks without axioms. To me it is not conceivable how Berkeley can be answered by pure reasoning; but I know that the nice and difficult task was to have been undertaken by one of the most luminous minds of the present age, had not politicks &lsquo;turned him from calm philosophy aside.&rsquo; What an admirable display of subtilty, united with brilliance, might his contending with Berkeley have afforded us! How must we, when we reflect on the loss of such an intellectual feast, regret that he should be characterised as the man,</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;Who born for the universe narrow&rsquo;d his mind,<br/>&nbsp;And to party gave up what was meant for mankind?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">My revered friend walked down with me to the beach, where we embraced and parted with tenderness, and engaged to correspond by letters. I said, &lsquo;I hope, Sir, you will not forget me in my absence.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Nay, Sir, it is more likely you should forget me, than that I should forget you.&rsquo; As the vessel put out to sea, I kept my eyes upon him for a considerable time, while he remained rolling his majestick frame in his usual manner: and at last I perceived him walk back into the town, and he disappeared.</p>
<p class="p24">Utrecht seeming at first very dull to me, after the animated scenes of London, my spirits were grievously affected; and I wrote to Johnson a plaintive and desponding letter, to which he paid no regard. Afterwards, when I had acquired a firmer tone of mind, I wrote him a second letter, expressing much anxiety to hear from him. At length I received the following epistle, which was of important service to me, and, I trust, will be so to many others.</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">&lsquo;A MR. BOSWELL, À LA COUR DE L&rsquo;EMPEREUR, UTRECHT.</span></p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;You are not to think yourself forgotten, or criminally neglected, that you have had yet no letter from me. I love to see my friends, to hear from them, to talk to them, and to talk of them; but it is not without a considerable effort of resolution that I prevail upon myself to write. I would not, however, gratify my own indolence by the omission of any important duty, or any office of real kindness.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To tell you that I am or am not well, that I have or have not been in the country, that I drank your health in the room in which we sat last together, and that your acquaintance continue to speak of you with their former kindness, topicks with which those letters are commonly filled which are written only for the sake of writing, I seldom shall think worth communicating; but if I can have it in my power to calm any harassing disquiet, to excite any virtuous desire, to rectify any important opinion, or fortify any generous resolution, you need not doubt but I shall at least wish to prefer the pleasure of gratifying a friend much less esteemed than yourself, before the gloomy calm of idle vacancy. Whether I shall easily arrive at an exact punctuality of correspondence, I cannot tell. I shall, at present, expect that you will receive this in return for two which I have had from you. The first, indeed, gave me an account so hopeless of the state of your mind, that it hardly admitted or deserved an answer; by the second I was much better pleased: and the pleasure will still be increased by such a narrative of the progress of your studies, as may evince the continuance of an equal and rational application of your mind to some useful enquiry.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;You will, perhaps, wish to ask, what study I would recommend. I shall not speak of theology, because it ought not to be considered as a question whether you shall endeavour to know the will of GOD.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I shall, therefore, consider only such studies as we are at liberty to pursue or to neglect; and of these I know not how you will make a better choice, than by studying the civil law, as your father advises, and the ancient languages, as you had determined for yourself; at least resolve, while you remain in any settled residence, to spend a certain number of hours every day amongst your books. The dissipation of thought, of which you complain, is nothing more than the vacillation of a mind suspended between different motives, and changing its direction as any motive gains or loses strength. If you can but kindle in your mind any strong desire, if you can but keep predominant any wish for some particular excellence or attainment, the gusts of imagination will break away, without any effect upon your conduct, and commonly without any traces left upon the memory.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;There lurks, perhaps, in every human heart a desire of distinction, which inclines every man first to hope, and then to believe, that Nature has given him something peculiar to himself. This vanity makes one mind nurse aversion, and another actuate desires, till they rise by art much above their original state of power; and as affectation, in time, improves to habit, they at last tyrannise over him who at first encouraged them only for show. Every desire is a viper in the bosom, who, while he was chill, was harmless; but when warmth gave him strength, exerted it in poison. You know a gentleman, who, when first he set his foot in the gay world, as he prepared himself to whirl in the vortex of pleasure, imagined a total indifference and universal negligence to be the most agreeable concomitants of youth, and the strongest indication of an airy temper and a quick apprehension. Vacant to every object, and sensible of every impulse, he thought that all appearance of diligence would deduct something from the reputation of genius; and hoped that he should appear to attain, amidst all the ease of carelessness, and all the tumult of diversion, that knowledge and those accomplishments which mortals of the common fabrick obtain only by mute abstraction and solitary drudgery. He tried this scheme of life awhile, was made weary of it by his sense and his virtue; he then wished to return to his studies; and finding long habits of idleness and pleasure harder to be cured than he expected, still willing to retain his claim to some extraordinary prerogatives, resolved the common consequences of irregularity into an unalterable decree of destiny, and concluded that Nature had originally formed him incapable of rational employment.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Let all such fancies, illusive and destructive, be banished henceforward from your thoughts for ever. Resolve, and keep your resolution; choose, and pursue your choice. If you spend this day in study, you will find yourself still more able to study to-morrow; not that you are to expect that you shall at once obtain a complete victory. Depravity is not very easily overcome. Resolution will sometimes relax, and diligence will sometimes be interrupted; but let no accidental surprise or deviation, whether short or long, dispose you to despondency. Consider these failings as incident to all mankind. Begin again where you left off, and endeavour to avoid the seducements that prevailed over you before.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;This, my dear Boswell, is advice which, perhaps, has been often given you, and given you without effect. But this advice, if you will not take from others, you must take from your own reflections, if you purpose to do the duties of the station to which the bounty of Providence has called you.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Let me have a long letter from you as soon as you can. I hope you continue your journal, and enrich it with many observations upon the country in which you reside. It will be a favour if you can get me any books in the Frisick language, and can enquire how the poor are maintained in the Seven Provinces. I am, dear Sir,</p>
<p class="p26">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rsquo;Your most affectionate servant,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&rsquo;London, Dec. 8, 1763.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I am sorry to observe, that neither in my own minutes, nor in my letters to Johnson, which have been preserved by him, can I find any information how the poor are maintained in the Seven Provinces. But I shall extract from one of my letters what I learnt concerning the other subject of his curiosity.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I have made all possible enquiry with respect to the Frisick language, and find that it has been less cultivated than any other of the northern dialects; a certain proof of which is their deficiency of books. Of the old Frisick there are no remains, except some ancient laws preserved by <span class="t8">Schotanus</span> in his <span class="t8">Beschryvinge van die Heerlykheid van Friesland</span>; and his <span class="t8">Historia Frisica</span>. I have not yet been able to find these books. Professor Trotz, who formerly was of the University of Vranyken in Friesland, and is at present preparing an edition of all the Frisick laws, gave me this information. Of the modern Frisick, or what is spoken by the boors at this day, I have procured a specimen. It is <span class="t8">Gisbert Japix&rsquo;s Rymelerie</span>, which is the only book that they have. It is amazing, that they have no translation of the bible, no treatises of devotion, nor even any of the ballads and storybooks which are so agreeable to country people. You shall have <span class="t8">Japix</span> by the first convenient opportunity. I doubt not to pick up <span class="t8">Schotanus</span>. Mynheer Trotz has promised me his assistance.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">1764: ÆTAT. 55.] Early in 1764 Johnson paid a visit to the Langton family, at their seat of Langton, in Lincolnshire, where he passed some time, much to his satisfaction. His friend Bennet Langton, it will not be doubted, did every thing in his power to make the place agreeable to so illustrious a guest; and the elder Mr. Langton and his lady, being fully capable of understanding his value, were not wanting in attention. He, however, told me, that old Mr. Langton, though a man of considerable learning, had so little allowance to make for his occasional &lsquo;laxity of talk,&rsquo; that because in the course of discussion he sometimes mentioned what might be said in favour of the peculiar tenets of the Romish church, he went to his grave believing him to be of that communion.</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson, during his stay at Langton, had the advantage of a good library, and saw several gentlemen of the neighbourhood. I have obtained from Mr. Langton the following particulars of this period.</p>
<p class="p24">He was now fully convinced that he could not have been satisfied with a country living; for, talking of a respectable clergyman in Lincolnshire, he observed, &lsquo;This man, Sir, fills up the duties of his life well. I approve of him, but could not imitate him.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">To a lady who endeavoured to vindicate herself from blame for neglecting social attention to worthy neighbours, by saying, &lsquo;I would go to them if it would do them any good,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;What good, Madam, do you expect to have in your power to do them? It is shewing them respect, and that is doing them good.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">So socially accommodating was he, that once when Mr. Langton and he were driving together in a coach, and Mr. Langton complained of being sick, he insisted that they should go out and sit on the back of it in the open air, which they did. And being sensible how strange the appearance must be, observed, that a countryman whom they saw in a field, would probably be thinking, &lsquo;If these two madmen should come down, what would become of me?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Soon after his return to London, which was in February, was founded that CLUB which existed long without a name, but at Mr. Garrick&rsquo;s funeral became distinguished by the title of THE LITERARY CLUB. Sir Joshua Reynolds had the merit of being the first proposer of it, to which Johnson acceded, and the original members were, Sir Joshua Reynolds, Dr. Johnson, Mr. Edmund Burke, Dr. Nugent, Mr. Beauclerk, Mr. Langton, Dr. Goldsmith, Mr. Chamier, and Sir John Hawkins. They met at the Turk&rsquo;s Head, in Gerrard-street, Soho, one evening in every week, at seven, and generally continued their conversation till a pretty late hour. This club has been gradually increased to its present number, thirty-five. After about ten years, instead of supping weekly, it was resolved to dine together once a fortnight during the meeting of Parliament. Their original tavern having been converted into a private house, they moved first to Prince&rsquo;s in Sackville-street, then to Le Telier&rsquo;s in Dover-street, and now meet at Parsloe&rsquo;s, St. James&rsquo;s-street . Between the time of its formation, and the time at which this work is passing through the press, (June 1792,) the following persons, now dead, were members of it: Mr. Dunning, (afterwards Lord Ashburton,) Mr. Samuel Dyer, Mr. Garrick, Dr. Shipley Bishop of St. Asaph, Mr. Vesey, Mr. Thomas Warton and Dr. Adam Smith. The present members are, &mdash; Mr. Burke, Mr. Langton, Lord Charlemont, Sir Robert Chambers, Dr. Percy Bishop of Dromore, Dr. Barnard Bishop of Killaloe, Dr. Marlay Bishop of Clonfert, Mr. Fox, Dr. George Fordyce, Sir William Scott, Sir Joseph Banks, Sir Charles Bunbury, Mr. Windham of Norfolk, Mr. Sheridan, Mr. Gibbon, Sir William Jones, Mr. Colman, Mr. Steevens, Dr. Burney, Dr. Joseph Warton, Mr. Malone, Lord Ossory, Lord Spencer, Lord Lucan, Lord Palmerston, Lord Eliot, Lord Macartney, Mr. Richard Burke junior, Sir William Hamilton, Dr. Warren, Mr. Courtenay, Dr. Hinchcliffe Bishop of Peterborough, the Duke of Leeds, Dr. Douglas Bishop of Salisbury, and the writer of this account.</p>
<p class="p24">Sir John Hawkins represents himself as a &lsquo;<span class="t8">seceder</span>&rsquo; from this society, and assigns as the reason of his &lsquo;<span class="t8">withdrawing</span>&rsquo; himself from it, that its late hours were inconsistent with his domestick arrangements. In this he is not accurate; for the fact was, that he one evening attacked Mr. Burke, in so rude a manner, that all the company testified their displeasure; and at their next meeting his reception was such, that he never came again.</p>
<p class="p24">He is equally inaccurate with respect to Mr. Garrick, of whom he says, &lsquo;he trusted that the least intimation of a desire to come among us, would procure him a ready admission; but in this he was mistaken. Johnson consulted me upon it; and when I could find no objection to receiving him, exclaimed,&mdash; &ldquo;He will disturb us by his buffoonery;&rdquo; &mdash; and afterwards so managed matters that he was never formally proposed, and, by consequence, never admitted.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">In justice both to Mr. Garrick and Dr. Johnson, I think it necessary to rectify this mis-statement. The truth is, that not very long after the institution of our club, Sir Joshua Reynolds was speaking of it to Garrick. &lsquo;I like it much, (said he,) I think I shall be of you.&rsquo; When Sir Joshua mentioned this to Dr. Johnson, he was much displeased with the actor&rsquo;s conceit. &lsquo;<span class="t8">He&rsquo;ll be of us</span>, (said Johnson) how does he know we will <span class="t8">permit</span> him? The first Duke in England has no right to hold such language.&rsquo; However, when Garrick was regularly proposed some time afterwards, Johnson, though he had taken a momentary offence at his arrogance, warmly and kindly supported him, and he was accordingly elected, was a most agreeable member, and continued to attend our meetings to the time of his death.</p>
<p class="p24">Mrs. Piozzi has also given a similar misrepresentation of Johnson&rsquo;s treatment of Garrick in this particular, as if he had used these contemptuous expressions: &lsquo;If Garrick does apply, I&rsquo;ll black-ball him. Surely, one ought to sit in a society like ours,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Unelbow&rsquo;d by a gamester, pimp, or player.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I am happy to be enabled by such unquestionable authority as that of Sir Joshua Reynolds, as well as from my own knowledge, to vindicate at once the heart of Johnson and the social merit of Garrick.</p>
<p class="p24">In this year, except what he may have done in revising <span class="t8">Shakspeare</span>, we do not find that he laboured much in literature. He wrote a review of Grainger&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Sugar Cane, a Poem</span>, in the <span class="t8">London Chronicle</span>. He told me, that Dr. Percy wrote the greatest part of this review; but, I imagine, he did not recollect it distinctly, for it appears to be mostly, if not altogether, his own. He also wrote in <span class="t8">The Critical Review</span>, an account of Goldsmith&rsquo;s excellent poem, <span class="t8">The Traveller</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">The ease and independence to which he had at last attained by royal munificence, increased his natural indolence. In his <span class="t8">Meditations</span> he thus accuses himself: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Good Friday, April 20, 1764. &mdash; I have made no reformation; I have lived totally useless, more sensual in thought, and more addicted to wine and meat.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">And next morning he thus feelingly complains: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;My indolence, since my last reception of the sacrament, has sunk into grosser sluggishness, and my dissipation spread into wilder negligence. My thoughts have been clouded with sensuality; and, except that from the beginning of this year I have, in some measure, forborne excess of strong drink, my appetites have predominated over my reason. A kind of strange oblivion has overspread me, so that I know not what has become of the last year; and perceive that incidents and intelligence pass over me, without leaving any impression.&rsquo; He then solemnly says,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;This is not the life to which heaven is promised;&rsquo; and he earnestly resolves an amendment.</p>
<p class="p24">It was his custom to observe certain days with a pious abstraction; viz. New-year&rsquo;s-day, the day of his wife&rsquo;s death, Good Friday, Easter-day, and his own birth-day. He this year says:&mdash; &lsquo;I have now spent fifty-five years in resolving; having, from the earliest time almost that I can remember, been forming schemes of a better life. I have done nothing. The need of doing, therefore, is pressing, since the time of doing is short. 0 GOD, grant me to resolve aright, and to keep my resolutions, for JESUS CHRIST&rsquo;S sake. Amen.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Such a tenderness of conscience, such a fervent desire of improvement, will rarely be found. It is, surely, not decent in those who are hardened in indifference to spiritual improvement, to treat this pious anxiety of Johnson with contempt.</p>
<p class="p24">About this time he was afflicted with a very severe return of the hypochondriack disorder, which was ever lurking about him. He was so ill, as, notwithstanding his remarkable love of company, to be entirely averse to society, the most fatal symptom of that malady. Dr. Adams told me, that as an old friend he was admitted to visit him, and that he found him in a deplorable state, sighing, groaning, talking to himself, and restlessly walking from room to room. He then used this emphatical expression of the misery which he felt: &lsquo;I would consent to have a limb amputated to recover my spirits.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Talking to himself was, indeed, one of his singularities ever since I knew him. I was certain that he was frequently uttering pious ejaculations; for fragments of the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer have been distinctly overheard. His friend Mr. Thomas Davies, of whom Churchill says,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;That Davies hath a very pretty wife,&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">when Dr. Johnson muttered &lsquo;lead us not into temptation,&rsquo; used with waggish and gallant humour to whisper Mrs. Davies, &lsquo;You, my dear, are the cause of this.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He had another particularity, of which none of his friends ever ventured to ask an explanation. It appeared to me some superstitious habit, which he had contracted early, and from which he had never called upon his reason to disentangle him. This was his anxious care to go out or in at a door or passage by a certain number of steps from a certain point, or at least so as that either his right or his left foot, (I am not certain which,) should constantly make the first actual movement when he came close to the door or passage. Thus I conjecture: for I have, upon innumerable occasions, observed him suddenly stop, and then seem to count his steps with a deep earnestness; and when he had neglected or gone wrong in this sort of magical movement, I have seen him go back again, put himself in a proper posture to begin the ceremony, and, having gone through it, break from his abstraction, walk briskly on, and join his companion. A strange instance of something of this nature, even when on horseback, happened when he was in the isle of Sky. Sir Joshua Reynolds has observed him to go a good way about, rather than cross a particular alley in Leicester-fields; but this Sir Joshua imputed to his having had some disagreeable recollection associated with it.</p>
<p class="p24">That the most minute singularities which belonged to him, and made very observable parts of his appearance and manner, may not be omitted, it is requisite to mention, that while talking or even musing as he sat in his chair, he commonly held his head to one side towards his right shoulder, and shook it in a tremulous manner, moving his body backwards and forwards, and rubbing his left knee in the same direction, with the palm of his hand. In the intervals of articulating he made various sounds with his mouth, sometimes as if ruminating, or what is called chewing the cud, sometimes giving a half whistle, some-times making his tongue play backwards from the roof of his mouth, as if clucking like a hen, and sometimes protruding it against his upper gums in front, as if pronouncing quickly under his breath, <span class="t8">too, too, too</span>: all this accompanied sometimes with a thoughtful look, but more frequently with a smile. Generally when he had concluded a period, in the course of a dispute, by which time he was a good deal exhausted by violence and vociferation, he used to blow out his breath like a Whale. This I supposed was a relief to his lungs; and seemed in him to be a contemptuous mode of expression, as if he had made the arguments of his opponent fly like chaff before the wind.</p>
<p class="p24">I am fully aware how very obvious an occasion I here give for the sneering jocularity of such as have no relish of an exact likeness; which to render complete, he who draws it must not disdain the slightest strokes. But if witlings should be inclined to attack this account, let them have the candour to quote what I have offered in my defence.</p>
<p class="p24">He was for some time in the summer at Easton Maudit, Northamptonshire, on a visit to the Reverend Dr. Percy, now Bishop of Dromore. Whatever dissatisfaction he felt at what he considered as a slow progress in intellectual improvement, we find that his heart was tender, and his affections warm, as appears from the following very kind letter:</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">&lsquo;TO JOSHUA REYNOLDS, ESQ., IN LEICESTER-FIELDS, LONDON.</span></p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I did not hear of your sickness till I heard likewise of your recovery, and therefore escaped that part of your pain, which every man must feel, to whom you are known as you are known to me.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Having had no particular account of your disorder, I know not in what state it has left you. If the amusement of my company can exhilarate the languor of a slow recovery, I will not delay a day to come to you; for I know not how I can so effectually promote my own pleasure as by pleasing you, or my own interest as by preserving you, in whom, if I should lose you, I should lose almost the only man whom I call a friend.</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;Pray let me hear of you from yourself, or from dear Miss Reynolds.<br/>Make my compliments to Mr. Mudge. I am, dear Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your most affectionate</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;And most humble servant,</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;At the Rev. Mr. Percy&rsquo;s, at Easton Maudit, Northamptonshire, (by Castle<br/>Ashby,) Aug. 19, 1764.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">1765: ÆTAT. 56. &mdash; Early in the year 1765 he paid a short visit to the University of Cambridge, with his friend Mr. Beauclerk. There is a lively picturesque account of his behaviour on this visit, in <span class="t8">The Gentleman&rsquo;s Magazine</span> for March 1785, being an extract of a letter from the late Dr. John Sharp. The two following sentences are very characteristical: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;He drank his large potations of tea with me, interrupted by many an indignant contradiction, and many a noble sentiment,&rsquo;&mdash; &lsquo;Several persons got into his company the last evening at Trinity, where, about twelve, he began to be very great; stripped poor Mrs. Macaulay to the very skin, then gave her for his toast, and drank her in two bumpers.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">The strictness of his self-examination and scrupulous Christian humility appear in his pious meditation on Easter-day this year.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I purpose again to partake of the blessed sacrament; yet when I consider how vainly I have hitherto resolved at this annual commemoration of my Saviour&rsquo;s death, to regulate my life by his laws, I am almost afraid to renew my resolutions.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">The concluding words are very remarkable, and shew that he laboured under a severe depression of spirits.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Since the last Easter I have reformed no evil habit, my time has been unprofitably spent, and seems as a dream that has left nothing behind. <span class="t8">My memory grows confused, and I know not how the days pass over me</span>. Good Lord deliver me!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">No man was more gratefully sensible of any kindness done to him than Johnson. There is a little circumstance in his diary this year, which shews him in a very amiable light.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;July 2. &mdash; I paid Mr. Simpson ten guineas, which he had formerly lent me in my necessity and for which Tetty expressed her gratitude.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;July 8. &mdash; I lent Mr. Simpson ten guineas more.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Here he had a pleasing opportunity of doing the same kindness to an old friend, which he had formerly received from him. Indeed his liberality as to money was very remarkable. The next article in his diary is,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;July 16. &mdash; I received seventy-five pounds. Lent Mr. Davis twenty-five.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Trinity College, Dublin, at this time surprised Johnson with a spontaneous compliment of the highest academical honours, by creating him Doctor of Laws. The diploma, which is in my possession, is as follows:</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;<span class="t8">OMNIBUS ad quos præsentes literae pervenerint, salutem. Nos Præpositus et Socii seniores Collegii sacrosanctæ et individuæ Trinitatis Reginæ Elizabethæ juxta Dublin, testamur</span>, Samueli Johnson, Armigero, ob egregiam scriptorum elegantiam et utilitatem, gratiam concessam fuisse pro gradu Doctoratus in utroque Jure, octavo die Julii, Anno Domini millesimo septingentesimo sexagesimo-quinto. In cujus rei testimonium singulorum manus et sigillum quo in hisce utimur apposuimus; vicesimo tertio die Julii, Anno Domini millesimo septingentesimo sexagesimo-quinto.</p>
<p class="p26">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rsquo;GUL. CLEMENT. FRAN. ANDREWS. R. MURRAY.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rsquo;THO. WILSON. Præps. ROBtus LAW.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rsquo;THO. LELAND. MICH. KEARNEY.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">This unsolicited mark of distinction, conferred on so great a literary character, did much honour to the judgement and liberal spirit of that learned body. Johnson acknowledged the favour in a letter to Dr. Leland, one of their number; but I have not been able to obtain a copy of it. </p>
<p class="p24">He appears this year to have been seized with a temporary fit of ambition, for he had thoughts both of studying law and of engaging in politics. His &lsquo;Prayer before the Study of Law&rsquo; is truly admirable: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Sept. 26, 1765.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Almighty GOD, the giver of wisdom, without whose help resolutions are vain, without whose blessing study is ineffectual; enable me, if it be thy will, to attain such knowledge as may qualify me to direct the doubtful, and instruct the ignorant; to prevent wrongs and terminate contentions; and grant that I may use that knowledge which I shall attain, to thy glory and my own salvation, for JESUS CHRIST&rsquo;S sake. Amen.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">His prayer in the view of becoming a politician is entitled, &lsquo;Engaging in POLITICKS with H &mdash;&mdash; n,&rsquo; no doubt his friend, the Right Honourable William Gerard Hamilton, for whom, during a long acquaintance, he had a great esteem, and to whose conversation he once paid this high compliment: &lsquo;I am very unwilling to be left alone, Sir, and therefore I go with my company down the first pair of stairs, in some hopes that they may, perhaps, return again. I go with you, Sir, as far as the street-door.&rsquo; In what particular department he intended to engage does not appear, nor can Mr. Hamilton explain. His prayer is in general terms: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Enlighten my understanding with knowledge of right, and govern my will by thy laws, that no deceit may mislead me, nor temptation corrupt me; that I may always endeavour to do good, and hinder evil.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">There is nothing upon the subject in his diary.</p>
<p class="p24">This year was distinguished by his being introduced into the family of Mr. Thrale, one of the most eminent brewers in England, and Member of Parliament for the borough of Southwark. Foreigners are not a little amazed when they hear of brewers, distillers, and men in similar departments of trade, held forth as persons of considerable consequence. In this great commercial country it is natural that a situation which produces much wealth should be considered as very respectable; and, no doubt, honest industry is entitled to esteem. But, perhaps, the too rapid advance of men of low extraction tends to lessen the value of that distinction by birth and gentility, which has ever been found beneficial to the grand scheme of subordination. Johnson used to give this account of the rise of Mr. Thrale&rsquo;s father: &lsquo;He worked at six shillings a week for twenty years in the great brewery, which afterwards was his own. The proprietor of it had an only daughter, who was married to a nobleman. It was not fit that a peer should continue the business. On the old man&rsquo;s death, therefore, the brewery was to be sold. To find a purchaser for so large a property was a difficult matter; and, after some time, it was suggested, that it would be adviseable to treat with Thrale, a sensible, active, honest man, who had been employed in the house, and to transfer the whole to him for thirty thousand pounds, security being taken upon the property. This was accordingly settled. In eleven years Thrale paid the purchase-money. He acquired a large fortune, and lived to be Member of Parliament for Southwark. But what was most remarkable was the liberality with which he used his riches. He gave his son and daughters the best education. The esteem which his good conduct procured him from the nobleman who had married his master&rsquo;s daughter, made him be treated with much attention; and his son, both at school and at the University of Oxford, associated with young men of the first rank. His allowance from his father, after he left college, was splendid; no less than a thousand a year. This, in a man who had risen as old Thrale did, was a very extraordinary instance of generosity. He used to say, &lsquo;If this young dog does not find so much after I am gone as he expects, let him remember that he has had a great deal in my own time.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">The son, though in affluent circumstances, had good sense enough to carry on his father&rsquo;s trade, which was of such extent, that I remember he once told me, he would not quit it for an annuity of ten thousand a year; &lsquo;Not (said he,) that I get ten thousand a year by it, but it is an estate to a family.&rsquo; Having left daughters only, the property was sold for the immense sum of one hundred and thirty-five thousand pounds; a magnificent proof of what may be done by fair trade in no long period of time.</p>
<p class="p24">There may be some who think that a new system of gentility might be established, upon principles totally different from what have hitherto prevailed. Our present heraldry, it may be said, is suited to the barbarous times in which it had its origin. It is chiefly founded upon ferocious merit, upon military excellence. Why, in civilised times, we may be asked, should there not be rank and honours, upon principles, which, independent of long custom, are certainly not less worthy, and which, when once allowed to be connected with elevation and precedency, would obtain the same dignity in our imagination? Why should not the knowledge, the skill, the expertness, the assiduity, and the spirited hazards of trade and commerce, when crowned with success, be entitled to give those flattering distinctions by which mankind are so universally captivated?</p>
<p class="p24">Such are the specious, but false arguments for a proposition which always will find numerous advocates, in a nation where men are every day starting up from obscurity to wealth. To refute them is needless. The general sense of mankind cries out, with irresistible force, &lsquo;Un gentilhomme est toujours gentilhomme&rsquo;.</p>
<p class="p24">Mr. Thrale had married Miss Hesther Lynch Salusbury, of good Welsh extraction, a lady of lively talents, improved by education. That Johnson&rsquo;s introduction into Mr. Thrale&rsquo;s family, which contributed so much to the happiness of his life, was owing to her desire for his conversation, is very probable and a general supposition: but it is not the truth. Mr. Murphy, who was intimate with Mr. Thrale, having spoken very highly of Dr. Johnson, he was requested to make them acquainted. This being mentioned to Johnson, he accepted of an invitation to dinner at Thrale&rsquo;s, and was so much pleased with his reception, both by Mr. and Mrs. Thrale, and they so much pleased with him, that his invitations to their house were more and more frequent, till at last he became one of the family, and an apartment was appropriated to him, both in their house in Southwark, and in their villa at Streatham.</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson had a very sincere esteem for Mr. Thrale, as a man of excellent principles, a good scholar, well skilled in trade, of a sound understanding, and of manners such as presented the character of a plain independent English &lsquo;Squire. As this family will frequently be mentioned in the course of the following pages, and as a false notion has prevailed that Mr. Thrale was inferiour, and in some degree insignificant, compared with Mrs. Thrale, it may be proper to give a true state of the case from the authority of Johnson himself in his own words.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I know no man, (said he,) who is more master of his wife and family than Thrale. If he but holds up a finger, he is obeyed. It is a great mistake to suppose that she is above him in literary attainments. She is more flippant; but he has ten times her learning: he is a regular scholar; but her learning is that of a school-boy in one of the lower forms.&rsquo; My readers may naturally wish for some representation of the figures of this couple. Mr. Thrale was tall, well proportioned, and stately. As for Madam, or my Mistress, by which epithets Johnson used to mention Mrs. Thrale, she was short, plump, and brisk. She has herself given us a lively view of the idea which Johnson had of her person, on her appearing before him in a dark-coloured gown; &lsquo;You little creatures should never wear those sort of clothes, however; they are unsuitable in every way. What! have not all insects gay colours?&rsquo; Mr. Thrale gave his wife a liberal indulgence, both in the choice of their company, and in the mode of entertaining them. He understood and valued Johnson, without remission, from their first acquaintance to the day of his death. Mrs. Thrale was enchanted with Johnson&rsquo;s conversation, for its own sake, and had also a very allowable vanity in appearing to be honoured with the attention of so celebrated a man.</p>
