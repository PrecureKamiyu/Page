The entity- relationship (<span class="s41">E-R</span>) data model is a widely used data model for database design. It provides a convenient graphical representation to view data, relationships, and constraints.</p><p class="s40" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 107pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s39">• </span>The <span class="s41">E-R </span>model is intended primarily for the database-design process. It was de- veloped to facilitate database design by allowing the speciﬁcation of an enterprise schema. Such a schema represents the overall logical structure of the database. This overall structure can be expressed graphically by an <span class="s41">E-R </span>diagram.</p><p class="s64" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 119pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;">Review Terms  <span class="s164">293</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s39" style="padding-left: 139pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: justify;">• <span class="s40">An entity is an object that exists in the real world and is distinguishable from other objects. We express the distinction by associating with each entity a set of attributes that describes the object.</span></p><p class="s39" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 139pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: justify;">• <span class="s40">A relationship is an association among several entities. A relationship set is a col- lection of relationships of the same type, and an entity set is a collection of entities of the same type.</span></p><p class="s39" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 139pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: justify;">• <span class="s40">The terms superkey, candidate key, and primary key apply to entity and relation- ship sets as they do for relation schemas. Identifying the primary key of a relation- ship set requires some care, since it is composed of attributes from one or more of the related entity sets.</span></p><p class="s39" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 139pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: justify;">• <span class="s40">Mapping cardinalities express the number of entities to which another entity can be associated via a relationship set.</span></p><p class="s39" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 139pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: justify;">• <span class="s40">An entity set that does not have suﬃcient attributes to form a primary key is termed a weak entity set. An entity set that has a primary key is termed a strong entity set.</span></p><p class="s40" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 139pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s39">• </span>The various features of the <span class="s41">E-R </span>model oﬀer the database designer numerous choices in how to best represent the enterprise being modeled. Concepts and ob- jects may, in certain cases, be represented by entities, relationships, or attributes. Aspects of the overall structure of the enterprise may be best described by using weak entity sets, generalization, specialization, or aggregation. Often, the designer must weigh the merits of a simple, compact model versus those of a more precise, but more complex one.</p><p class="s40" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 139pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s39">• </span>A database design speciﬁed by an <span class="s41">E-R </span>diagram can be represented by a collection of relation schemas. For each entity set and for each relationship set in the database, there is a unique relation schema that is assigned the name of the corresponding entity set or relationship set. This forms the basis for deriving a relational database design from an <span class="s41">E-R </span>diagram.</p><p class="s39" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 139pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: justify;">• <span class="s40">Specialization and generalization deﬁne a containment relationship between a higher-level entity set and one or more lower-level entity sets. Specialization is the result of taking a subset of a higher-level entity set to form a lower-level entity set. Generalization is the result of taking the union of two or more disjoint (lower- level) entity sets to produce a higher-level entity set. The attributes of higher-level entity sets are inherited by lower-level entity sets.</span></p><p class="s39" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 139pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: justify;">• <span class="s40">Aggregation is an abstraction in which relationship sets (along with their asso- ciated entity sets) are treated as higher-level entity sets, and can participate in relationships.</span></p><p class="s40" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 139pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s39">• </span>Care must be taken in <span class="s41">E-R </span>design.
