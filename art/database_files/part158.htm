As we saw earlier, multivalued dependencies help us understand and eliminate some forms of repetition of information that cannot be understood in terms of functional dependencies. There are types of constraints called </span>join dependencies <span class="p">that generalize multivalued dependen- cies and lead to another normal form called </span>project-join normal form (<span class="s82">PJNF</span>)<span class="p">. </span><span class="s44">PJNF </span><span class="p">is called </span>fifth normal form <span class="p">in some books. There is a class of even more general constraints that leads to a normal form called </span>domain-key normal form (<span class="s82">DKNF</span>)<span class="p">.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 119pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">A practical problem with the use of these generalized constraints is that they are not only hard to reason with, but there is also no set of sound and complete inference rules for reasoning about the constraints. Hence <span class="s44">PJNF </span>and <span class="s44">DKNF </span>are used quite rarely. Chapter 28 provides more details about these normal forms.</p><p style="padding-left: 119pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">Conspicuous by its absence from our discussion of normal forms is <b>second normal form </b>(<span class="s44">2NF</span>).
