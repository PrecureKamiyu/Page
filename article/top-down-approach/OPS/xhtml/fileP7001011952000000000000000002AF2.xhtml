In the broadest sense, a mobile node is one that changes its point of attachment into the network over time. Because the term <i>mobility</i> has taken on many meanings in both the computer and telephony worlds, it will serve us well first to consider several dimensions of mobility in some detail.</p>

This user is also mobile (although less so than the BMW driver!) but does not need to maintain an ongoing connection while moving between points of attachment to the network. <a class="xref" href="#P7001011952000000000000000002AFA" data-foobar="1"><span class="label">Figure</span> <span class="number">7.22</span></a> illustrates this spectrum of user mobility from the network layer’s perspective.</p></li>

Must a laptop similarly maintain the same IP address while moving between IP networks?</p>
<p class="continued" id="P700101195200000000000000000B43C" data-uri="M07_KURO4140_07_SE_C07.xhtml#P700101195200000000000000000B43C">The answer to this question will depend strongly on the applications being run. For the BMW or Tesla driver who wants to maintain an uninterrupted TCP connection to a remote application while zipping along the autobahn, it would be convenient to maintain the same IP address. Recall from <a class="xref" href="fileP70010119520000000000000000010EC.xhtml#P70010119520000000000000000010EC" data-foobar="7"><span class="label">Chapter</span> <span class="number">3</span></a> that an Internet application needs to know the IP address and port number of the remote entity with which it is communicating. If a mobile entity is able to maintain its IP address as it moves, mobility becomes invisible from the application standpoint. There is great value to this transparency—an application need not be concerned with a potentially changing IP address, and the same application code serves mobile and nonmobile connections alike. We’ll see in the following section that mobile IP provides this transparency, allowing a mobile node to maintain its permanent IP address while moving among networks.</p>
<p class="continued" id="P700101195200000000000000000B43D" data-uri="M07_KURO4140_07_SE_C07.xhtml#P700101195200000000000000000B43D">On the other hand, a less glamorous mobile user might simply want to turn off an office laptop, bring that laptop home, power up, and work from home. If the laptop functions primarily as a client in client-server applications (e.g., send/read e-mail, browse the Web, Telnet to a remote host) from home, the particular IP address used by the laptop is not that important. In particular, one could get by fine with an address that is temporarily allocated to the laptop by the ISP serving the home. We saw in <a class="xref" href="fileP7001011952000000000000000001B24.xhtml#P7001011952000000000000000001B24" data-foobar="7"><span class="label">Section</span> <span class="number">4.3</span></a> that DHCP already provides this functionality.</p></li>

What if no such infrastructure exists? If two users are within communication proximity of each other, can they establish a network connection in the absence of any other network-layer infrastructure? Ad hoc networking provides precisely these capabilities. This rapidly developing area is at the cutting edge of mobile networking research and is beyond the scope of this book. <a class="biblioref" href="fileP70010119520000000000000000037E0.xhtml#P7001011952000000000000000003AA7" data-foobar="7">[Perkins 2000]</a> and the IETF Mobile Ad Hoc Network (manet) working group Web pages [manet 2016] provide thorough treatments of the subject.</p></li>

A twenty-something adult moving out of the family home becomes mobile, living in a series of dormitories and/or apartments, and often changing addresses. If an old friend wants to get in touch, how can that friend find the address of her mobile friend? One common way is to contact the family, since a mobile adult will often register his or her current address with the family (if for no other reason than so that the parents can send money to help pay the rent!). The family home, with its permanent address, becomes that one place that others can go as a first step in communicating with the mobile adult. Later communication from the friend may be either indirect (for example, with mail being sent first to the parents’ home and then forwarded to the mobile adult) or direct (for example, with the friend using the address obtained from the parents to send mail directly to her mobile friend).</p>

When a mobile node is resident in a foreign network, all traffic addressed to the node’s permanent address now needs to be routed to the foreign network. How can this be done? One option is for the foreign network to advertise to all other networks that the mobile node is resident in its network. This could be via the usual exchange of intradomain and interdomain routing information and would require few changes to the existing routing infrastructure. The foreign network could simply advertise to its neighbors that it has a highly specific route to the mobile node’s permanent address (that is, essentially inform other networks that it has the correct path for routing datagrams to the mobile node’s permanent address; see <a class="xref" href="fileP7001011952000000000000000001B24.xhtml#P7001011952000000000000000001B24" data-foobar="7"><span class="label">Section</span> <span class="number">4.3</span></a>). These neighbors would then propagate this routing information throughout the network as part of the normal procedure of updating routing information and forwarding tables. When the mobile node leaves one foreign network and joins another, the new foreign network would advertise a new, highly specific route to the mobile node, and the old foreign network would withdraw its routing information regarding the mobile node.</p>
<p id="P700101195200000000000000000B44B" data-uri="M07_KURO4140_07_SE_C07.xhtml#P700101195200000000000000000B44B">This solves two problems at once, and it does so without making significant changes to the network-layer infrastructure.

A significant drawback, however, is that of scalability. If mobility management were to be the responsibility of network routers, the routers would have to maintain forwarding table entries for potentially millions of mobile nodes, and update these entries as nodes move. Some additional drawbacks are explored in the problems at the end of this chapter.</p>

A natural way to do this is via the mobile node’s home network. In much the same way that parents of the mobile twenty-something track their child’s location, the home agent in the mobile node’s home network can track the foreign network in which the mobile node resides. A protocol between the mobile node (or a foreign agent representing the mobile node) and the home agent will certainly be needed to update the mobile node’s location.</p>

When visiting network 79.129.13/24, the mobile node has a COA of 79.129.13.2. A second role of the foreign agent is to inform the home agent that the mobile node is resident in its (the foreign agent’s) network and has the given COA. We’ll see shortly that the COA will be used to “reroute” datagrams to the mobile node via its foreign agent.</p>

For example, the mobile node could obtain a COA in the foreign network (for example, using a protocol such as DHCP) and itself inform the home agent of its COA.</p>

But having the home agent know the COA solves only part of the problem. How should datagrams be addressed and forwarded to the mobile node? Since only the home agent (and not network-wide routers) knows the location of the mobile node, it will no longer suffice to simply address a datagram to the mobile node’s permanent address and send it into the network-layer infrastructure. Something more must be done. Two approaches can be identified, which we will refer to as indirect and direct routing.</p>

Such datagrams are first routed, as usual, to the mobile node’s home network.

The home agent intercepts these datagrams and then forwards them to a mobile node in a two-step process.

The home agent will need to address the datagram using the mobile node’s COA, so that the network layer will route the datagram to the foreign network. On the other hand, it is desirable to leave the correspondent’s datagram intact, since the application receiving the datagram should be unaware that the datagram was forwarded via the home agent. Both goals can be satisfied by having the home agent <span class="keyword" id="P7001011952000000000000000002B36" data-uri="M07_KURO4140_07_SE_C07.xhtml#P7001011952000000000000000002B36"><b>encapsulate</b></span> the correspondent’s original complete datagram within a new (larger) datagram.

As an example of how these pieces fit together, assume the mobile node is attached to foreign network A, has registered a COA in network A with its home agent, and is receiving datagrams that are being indirectly routed through its home agent. The mobile node now moves to foreign network B and registers with the foreign agent in network B, which informs the home agent of the mobile node’s new COA. From this point on, the home agent will reroute datagrams to foreign network B. As far as a correspondent is concerned, mobility is transparent—datagrams are routed via the same home agent both before and after the move. As far as the home agent is concerned, there is no disruption in the flow of datagrams—arriving datagrams are first forwarded to foreign network A; after the change in COA, datagrams are forwarded to foreign network B. But will the mobile node see an interrupted flow of datagrams as it moves between networks? As long as the time between the mobile node’s disconnection from network A (at which point it can no longer receive datagrams via A) and its attachment to network B (at which point it will register a new COA with its home agent) is small, few datagrams will be lost. Recall from <a class="xref" href="fileP70010119520000000000000000010EC.xhtml#P70010119520000000000000000010EC" data-foobar="7"><span class="label">Chapter</span> <span class="number">3</span></a> that end-to-end connections can suffer datagram loss due to network congestion.

This can be done by having the correspondent agent query the home agent, assuming that (as in the case of indirect routing) the mobile node has an up-to-date value for its COA registered with its home agent. It is also possible for the correspondent itself to perform the function of the correspondent agent, just as a mobile node could perform the function of the foreign agent. This is shown as steps 1 and 2 in <a class="xref" href="#P7001011952000000000000000002B5D" data-foobar="1"><span class="label">Figure</span> <span class="number">7.26</span></a>.

In the case of indirect routing, this problem was easily solved by updating the COA maintained by the home agent. However, with direct routing, the home agent is queried for the COA by the correspondent agent only once, at the beginning of the session. Thus, updating the COA at the home agent, while necessary, will not be enough to solve the problem of routing data to the mobile node’s new foreign network.</p></li>
