<h2 class="h20"><a id="a1169"></a>PREFACE</h2>
<p class="p21">TO keep a Diary was one of Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s lifelong, pious, and unfulfilled Resolutions. He evidently thought, could he but accomplish this desire, he would have been aided in his perpetual struggle after stability of purpose, a rule of life and tranquillity of mind. Though, as events proved, Johnson could no more keep a continuous Diary than he could get up early in the morning (and this although he once sat up all night framing resolutions to do both the one and the other), he did succeed in filling a number of notebooks (some of the tiniest dimensions) with prayers and meditations of the most private and searching character. Some, by no means all, of these <span class="t8">Memoranda</span> Johnson, as his end approached, confided to his friend Dr. Strahan, then Vicar of Islington, for publication after death. His first and his main object in giving this direction was Charity (see note on p. 14). A man of letters gets to regard any manuscript of his as so much money. As for the contents of these notebooks, it may of course be, as subsequent editors have surmised, that Johnson dimly remembered them, but personally I have no doubt that the governing consideration with him in this respect, was his complete indifference to personal criticism. He knew the little books contained nothing contrary to religion, and he was therefore perfectly content to let what was in them go forth. We were all told in our childhood that &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t care&rsquo; came to a bad end. Johnson, I must suppose, is the proverbial exception, for no man cared less than he what people said or might say.</p>
<p class="p24">Pious authors of the first rank are sufficiently rare to make us thankful for <span class="t8">Prayers and Meditations,</span> and Johnson&rsquo;s piety is as indisputable as it is interesting. It represents a type always prevalent among the laity, but exceedingly ill-represented in our literature. It is not the primitive piety of the Early Church, nor is it the Evangelicalism of a later day, still less the &lsquo;enthusiasm&rsquo; of the Methodist Revival. There is something medi√¶val about its gloom &mdash; something Jansenist about its mysticism, whilst there is not a little of the Eighteenth Century in that &lsquo;obstinate rationality&rsquo; which, as the doctor himself half proudly, half ruefully admitted, made communion with the Roman Church an impossibility for him.</p>
<p class="p24">Religion to Johnson was an awful thing. He never learnt to take his ease on Zion. In the tavern, indeed, he could stretch out his legs and hold his own and far more than his own with all comers, but in Church, or in the grim solitude of his chamber he knelt in self-abasement, with fear and trembling. There is no taint of professionalism about his faith. He is nothing of the cleric. He owns to hours of doubt and darkness. The world was always very near to him, nor does he ever pretend to have got rid of the flesh. Ill thoughts pursue him even to the Altar on the occasion of his annual communions on Easter Sunday. His constant prayer was to be loosed <span class="t8">from the chain of his sin</span>: &lsquo;though we be tied and bound with the chain of our sin, yet let the pitifulness of thy great mercy loose us.&rsquo; Johnson has been blamed for the timidity of his piety by more confident spirits, but who can doubt its representative character? &lsquo;Samuel Johnson in the era of Voltaire&rsquo; purifying and fortifying his soul, and holding real communion with the Highest, &lsquo;in the Church of St. Clement Danes,&rsquo; was to Carlyle a thing to be looked at &lsquo;with pity, admiration, and awe.&rsquo; In these <span class="t8">Prayers and Meditations</span> the reader is admitted, let him not abuse the occasion, into the innermost sanctuary of a soul. It is a welcome retreat for the student of Eighteenth Century Literature. &lsquo;What think you of our new set of Fanatics, called the <span class="t8">Methodists?</span> I have seen Whitefield&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Journal,</span> and he appears to me as mad as ever George Fox the Quaker. These are very fit missionaries you will say to propagate the Christian faith among Infidels. There is another of them, one Wesley, who came over from the same mission. So a future Bishop, the learned Warburton, may be discovered writing to the ingenuous Mr. Des Maiseaux in the second volume of Nichol&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Literary History.</span> What with untutored enthusiasm on the one hand, a somewhat heartless scepticism on the other, and the mid-channel full of the downright irreligion of the Warburtonian school, Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s trembling piety and utter sincerity is a true haven of refuge.</p>
<p class="p24">It is strange in reading the <span class="t8">Prayers and Meditations</span> to come across Johnson&rsquo;s frank admission, made in his sixty-third year, that he &lsquo;had never looked upon a very great part&rsquo; of the Bible. But this defect he had managed to cure by the following year (see p. 75).</p>
