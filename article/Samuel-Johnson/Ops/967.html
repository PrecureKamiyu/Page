<p class="p21">First published in 1791, seven years after the death of Johnson, this famous work is now regarded as an important stage in the development of the modern genre of biography, with many critics believing it to be the greatest biography written in the English language. Although Boswell&rsquo;s personal acquaintance with his subject only began in 1763, when Johnson was 54 years old, he covered the entirety of Johnson&rsquo;s life by means of additional and, at times, exhaustive research. Regardless of certain critical liberties made by Boswell, the biography is an important source of information not only on Johnson, but as a detailed understanding of his times. </p>
<p class="p22">On 16 May 1763, Johnson had first met the 24-year-old Boswell, who would later become his great biographer, in the book shop of their mutual acquaintance, Tom Davies. They quickly became friends, although Boswell would return to his home in Scotland or travel abroad for months at a time. During his life, Boswell kept a series of journals that detailed the various moments that he felt were important. This journal, when published in the 20th century, filled eighteen volumes, and it was from this large collection of detailed notes that Boswell had based his works on Johnson&rsquo;s life. </p>
<p class="p22">In 1773 Johnson set out to visit his friend in Scotland, in order to begin &ldquo;a journey to the western islands of Scotland&rdquo;, as Johnson&rsquo;s 1775 account of their travels would put it. Boswell&rsquo;s account, <span class="t8">The Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides</span> (1786), was a preliminary attempt at a biography before his <span class="t8">Life of Johnson</span>. Following the success of that work, which was in essence a study of Johnson touring the Hebrides &mdash; rather than the place itself &mdash; Boswell started working on the &ldquo;vast treasure of his conversations at different times&rdquo; that he recorded in his journals. He set himself the goal of recreating Johnson&rsquo;s &ldquo;life in scenes&rdquo;. </p>
<p class="p22">Boswell&rsquo;s biography was an instant success with readers. Edmund Burke was reported to have told King George III that the book entertained him more than any other work. Robert Anderson, in his <span class="t8">Works of the British Poets</span> (1795), wrote: &ldquo;With some venial exceptions on the score of egotism and indiscriminate admiration, his work exhibits the most copious, interesting, and finished picture of the life and opinions of an eminent man, that was ever executed; and is justly esteemed one of the most instructive and entertaining books in the English language.&rdquo; In the <span class="t8">Edinburgh Review, </span>Macaulay praised the biography&rsquo;s highly influential manner, establishing a way of thinking of Boswell and his <span class="t8">Life of Johnson</span> which was to prevail for centuries. Macaulay wrote, &ldquo;Boswell is the first of biographers. He has no second. He has distanced all his competitors so decidedly that it is not worth while to place them&rdquo;.</p>
