<p class="p21">This 1775 travel narrative concerns an eighty-three day journey through Scotland, in particular the islands of the Hebrides, made by the author in the late summer and autumn of 1773. The sixty-three year-old Johnson was accompanied by his thirty-two year-old friend of many years, James Boswell, who was also keeping a record of the trip, which he published in 1785 as <span class="t8">A Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides</span>. </p>
<p class="p22">Scotland was still a relatively wild place in 1773, with marauding privateers and slave-ships working the coasts and the destruction of Scottish forests was in operation. The Scottish clan system had been dismantled by Act of Parliament, the population had been disarmed and wearing of the tartan was prohibited. Scotch whisky was distilled illegally and profusely. The rule of law was by no means properly established and though the power of the clan chieftains was curtailed, it was often the only real authority.</p>
<p class="p22">Johnson and Boswell toured the Highlands and islands by carriage, on horseback and by boat, planning the stages of their journey to stay at the houses of the local gentry. They were astounded when they visited their colleague Lord Monboddo at Monboddo House and saw him in his primitive attire as a farmer, a quite different picture from his image as an urbane Edinburgh Court of Session jurist, philosopher and evolutionary thinker.</p>
<p class="p22">This part of Scotland in 1773 was a romantic place. It was relatively empty of people and nearly unspoiled by commerce, roads and other displays of modern life; in fact, Johnson was fascinated that in some Highland islands money had not yet become custom, with some parts of Scotland were more akin to the 8<span class="t21">th</span> century than the 18<span class="t21">th</span> century. Once Johnson reached the West Highlands, there were few roads, none at all on the Isle of Skye, and so they traveled by horseback, usually along the ridge of a hill with a local guide, who knew the terrain and the best route for the season. </p>
