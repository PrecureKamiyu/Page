The trade-offs such tables present are in time and space – the bigger the table, the faster a TLB miss can be serviced, as well as the converse – and thus the right choice of structure depends strongly on the constraints of the given environment.</p><p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: left;">In a memory-constrained system (like many older systems), small struc- tures make sense; in a system with a reasonable amount of memory and with workloads that actively use a large number of pages, a bigger ta- ble that speeds up TLB misses might be the right choice. With software- managed TLBs, the entire space of data structures opens up to the delight of the operating system innovator (hint: that’s you). What new struc- tures can you come up with? What problems do they solve? Think of these questions as you fall asleep, and dream the big dreams that only operating-system developers can dream.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part210.htm">&lt; 上一个</a><span> | </span><a href="../ostep.html">内容</a><span> | </span><a href="part212.htm">下一个 &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
