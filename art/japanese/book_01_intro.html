		<h1>Introduction to the Introduction</h1>
        <p>The chapter is the intro chapter of the book <em>The languages of Japan</em> part two: the Japanese language, which is different from the Ainu language used by local japanese. The intro chapter changed the subject completely, and introduced some myths about Japanese. The author claimed that most of the myths are inaccurate or false, indeed, through which we obtained a overall image about Japanese.

		<p>The text you provided discusses various aspects of the Japanese language, including its typological classification, grammatical structure, and word formation processes. Some of the main points covered in the text include:</p>
		<p>
		<ol>
			<li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Japanese is considered a language-isolate because its genetic affiliation to other languages or language families is not definitively known.</li>
			<li style = "margin-bottom: 10px;">Japanese has several myths associated with it, including its uniqueness, illogicality, and difficulty.
			</li>
			<li style = "margin-bottom: 10px;">From an overall structural point of view, Japanese is not unique but rather a typical human language with a basic word order of Subject-Object-Verb (SOV) and a modifier-head pattern followed by other grammatical elements.</li>
			<li style = "margin-bottom: 10px;">Japanese is classified as an agglutinative language due to its use of affixation in its verbal morphology.</li>
			<li style = "margin-bottom: 10px;"> These are just some of the main points covered in the text you provided. The text offers a detailed and nuanced perspective on the Japanese language and its various features and characteristics. </li>
			<li style = "margin-bottom: 10px;">Japanese has three types of word formation: lexical word formation, syntactic word formation, and post-syntactic word formation.</li>
			<li style = "margin-bottom: 10px;">The accentual system of Japanese involves two units of counting: syllables and moras.</li>
			<li style = "margin-bottom: 10px;">Japanese lies in the middle of the subject-topic dichotomy, possessing an archetypical topic construction while also having the notion of subject figure importantly in its syntactic organization.</li>

		<h2>Agglutinative language</h2>
		<p>An agglutinative language is a type of language in which words are formed by combining multiple morphemes (units of meaning) together through a process called affixation. In agglutinative languages, affixes such as prefixes or suffixes are added to a base word to create new words with different meanings. Each affix typically carries a single grammatical function or meaning, and the boundaries between affixes and the base word are usually clear and easily identifiable.</p>

		<p>Agglutinative languages are contrasted with other types of languages such as fusional languages, in which multiple grammatical functions or meanings can be expressed by a single affix and the boundaries between affixes and the base word are often less clear. Japanese is an example of an agglutinative language, as it involves a fair amount of affixation in its verbal morphology.</p>
		<h2>Tone</h2>
		<p>The text you provided discusses the use of tone as a typological classificatory feature in phonology. Tone refers to the use of pitch to distinguish the meaning of words in a language. If a textbook definition were applied to Japanese, most Japanese dialects would be classified as tone languages because the pitch of a syllable (whether it is high or low) can affect the meaning of a word to a certain extent.</p>

		<p>However, Japanese differs from archetypical tone languages like Chinese. In Chinese and other similar languages, it is necessary to specify the tone for each syllable. In Japanese, on the other hand, the pitch of each syllable in a phrase can be predicted given an accent marker and a set of rules.</p>

		<p>The accentual system of Japanese also involves two units of counting: syllables and moras. Moras are units of sound that have been lost in most European languages. The use of these units in the accentual system is one of the features that distinguishes different dialect groups within Japanese.</p>

		<h2>Syllables and Moras</h2>

		<p>The paragraph you provided discusses the accentual system of Japanese, which involves two units of counting: syllables and moras. Syllables are units of sound that typically consist of a vowel sound or a combination of consonant and vowel sounds. Moras, on the other hand, are units of sound that represent the timing or rhythm of speech. In Japanese, a single syllable can consist of one or two moras. For example, the word “Tokyo” has two syllables but four moras: “To-o-kyo-o.”

		<p>Moras are an important feature of the Japanese accentual system and are used to determine the placement of pitch accents in words and phrases. The use of moras in the accentual system is one of the features that distinguishes different dialect groups within Japanese. For example, some dialects have different rules for placing pitch accents based on the number of moras in a word.

		<p>Moras are not commonly used in most European languages, which have lost this feature of their sound systems. Instead, European languages typically rely on syllables as the primary unit of counting in their accentual systems.

		<h2>Word formation</h2>

		<p>The text you provided discusses the different types of word formation in Japanese. Japanese word formation involves various types of suffixes, some of which appear to have a syntactic basis. Japanese also has productive mechanisms for forming compounds, and one type of compound formation also seems to have syntactic relevance.

		<p>According to the text, three types of word formation need to be recognized in Japanese: lexical word formation, syntactic word formation, and post-syntactic word formation. Lexical word formation includes one type of compound formation and certain affixing processes. Syntactic word formation involves affixation with the honorific prefix as well as the causative and passive morphemes. Post-syntactic word formation involves another type of compound formation.

		<p>These different types of word formation in Japanese offer an interesting perspective on the relationship between morphology and syntax in the language.

		<h2>More on word formation</h2>

		<p>Lexical word formation, syntactic word formation, and post-syntactic word formation are three types of word formation processes that are mentioned in the text you provided.

		<p>Lexical word formation refers to the process of creating new words by combining existing words or morphemes in a language’s lexicon. This can include processes such as compounding, where two or more words are combined to create a new word with a distinct meaning. For example, in Japanese, the words “denwa” (telephone) and “bangou” (number) can be combined to form the compound word “denwabangou” (telephone number).

		<p>Syntactic word formation refers to the process of creating new words through the application of grammatical rules and operations. This can include processes such as affixation, where affixes such as prefixes or suffixes are added to a base word to create a new word with a different grammatical function. For example, in Japanese, the verb “taberu” (to eat) can be turned into its causative form “tabesaseru” (to make someone eat) by adding the causative suffix “-saseru.”

		<p>Post-syntactic word formation refers to the process of creating new words after the syntactic structure of a sentence has been determined. This can include processes such as compound formation, where two or more words are combined to create a new word after the syntactic structure of a sentence has been established.

		<p>These are just some examples of how lexical, syntactic, and post-syntactic word formation can work in Japanese. Each type of word formation involves different mechanisms and processes for creating new words and expressing different meanings and grammatical functions.

		<h2>A little about ha and ga</h2>
		<p>The text you provided discusses the topic construction in Japanese, which is dealt with in Chapter 11 of the text. The topic construction is a syntactic structure in which a sentence is organized around a topic, which is typically marked by a particle such as “wa” in Japanese.

		<p>The text mentions that among the recently proposed typological parameters for classifying languages is the distinction between subject-prominence and topic-prominence. Subject-prominent languages are those in which the subject of a sentence plays a central role in its syntactic organization, while topic-prominent languages are those in which the topic of a sentence plays a central role.

		<p>According to the text, Japanese lies in the middle of this subject-topic dichotomy. It possesses an archetypical topic construction, but the notion of subject also figures importantly in its syntactic organization. This means that Japanese affords an interesting perspective on the two basic types of sentence construction - subject-prominence and topic-prominence - which are often merged in one direction or the other in many other languages.

		<h2>Tense, aspect, mood</h2>
		<p>Aspect, mood and tense are grammatical categories that help convey when an action takes place (tense), the completeness of the action (aspect), and the speaker’s attitude towards the action (mood).

		<p>In Japanese, tense refers to past or non-past. For example, “tabemasu” (食べます) means “eat” in non-past tense while “tabemashita” (食べました) means “ate” in past tense.

		<p>Aspect in Japanese is expressed through verb forms such as the -te form and -ta form. For example, “tabete imasu” (食べています) means “is eating” which is the progressive aspect.

		<p>Mood in Japanese is expressed through various grammatical forms such as the volitional form and the imperative form. For example, “tabeyou” (食べよう) means “let’s eat” which is the volitional mood while “tabero” (食べろ) means “eat!” which is the imperative mood.

		<h2>Arguments and adjuncts</h2>

		<p>In linguistics, an argument is an expression that helps complete the meaning of a predicate. Most predicates take one, two, or three arguments. A predicate and its arguments form a predicate-argument structure. Arguments must be distinguished from adjuncts. While a predicate needs its arguments to complete its meaning, the adjuncts that appear with a predicate are optional; they are not necessary to complete the meaning of the predicate1.

		<p>For example, in Japanese sentence “John は Jane を 褒めた” (John praised Jane), “John” and “Jane” are arguments of the verb “褒めた” (praised). If we add additional information to this sentence such as “John-wa Jane-o kinou home-ta” (John praised Jane yesterday), “kinou” (yesterday) is an adjunct that provides additional information but is not necessary to complete the meaning of the verb “褒めた” (praised).

		<h2>Question pull</h2>
		<p>The “question pull” test is a diagnostic test proposed by Yoko Hasegawa in 1988 to distinguish between arguments and adjuncts in Japanese1. The test is based on the idea that when a hearer is unable to identify the referent of an argument, they would likely ask for clarification. However, it would sound absurd for the hearer to ask for an adjunct before all obligatory arguments are clarified. This natural sequence of obtaining information supports the idea that certain elements (arguments) are indispensable for understanding a clause while others (adjuncts) contribute non-essential, supplemental information.
