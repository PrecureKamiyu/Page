       <h1>About Japanese</h1>
       <h2>About learning Japanese</h2>
       <p>
       Are you interested about the Japanese? If you are, there is something interesting about learning Japanese, that is
       学校语法和教育语法. 
       </p>
       <p>教育语法是面对非母语学习者的, 在标日中, 在单词表中, 动词为ます形, 但其在学校语法中称为连体形 + ます助动词, 类比于英语里面, can should 等助动词后面需加上原型, 而 need 可以加不定式. 同理, ない形也是如此. 更比如, 我们能见到复合动词, 其为两个动词的链接, 形式为连体形 + 动词</p>
       <p>我们能看见这里的分歧, 现在的问题是如何选择. 得到的建议是, 先学教育语法, 学到中等水平之后再深入接触学校语法. 
       各个人的意见各不相同, 并且有人指出, 教学领域里其实也是混乱不堪, 没人搞得懂哪个更为合适. </p>
       <h2>About Japanese in TeX</h2>
       <p>
       pTeX is invented for typesetting Japanese. And UpTeX is the extended version of pTeX. Both of them may have been viewed 
       as Legacy for typesetting Japanese for LuaTeX is doing a pretty good job. 
       </p>
       <p>
       Before you try to formatting some Japanese yourself, you may want to check out for this article about <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/jlreq/?lang=en">jlreq</a>. Basically, it tells about the standard when formatting Japanese. You may skip it since it is too long. Anyway, you need to know that there is such thing as jlreq. 
       </p>
       <p>You may begin with a simple <code>.tex</code> file</p>
       <pre>
       <code>\documentclass{jlreq}
       \begin{document}
       こんにちは。
       \end{document}</code></pre>
       <p>And compile the <code>.tex</code> file with <code>uplatex</code>. And you will get a <code>.dvi</code> file, whose name stands for <q>device indenpendent</q>, which is one of the feature of <code>.pdf</code> file, since it is designed that the same thing is displayed on different devices and you may guess that <code>.dvi</code> plays the similar role before <code>.pdf</code> is born. Stupid Japanese use it because they can, for their devices haven't been renewed for decades. Your device already have been installed with <code>.dvi</code> reader if you have installed TeX Live. 
       A tool <code>dvipdfmx</code> is also installed which is used to, as its name has shown, to convert <code>.dvi</code> file into a <code>.pdf</code> file. </p>
       <p>However, things get interesting when you try to open the output file, viz., the <code>.dvi</code> file. You just can't open it, or you may be able to open it since there could be something wrong with my device. Anyway, what is happening is that <code>.dvi</code> file does not have the information of font. When <code>uplatex</code> compile the <code>.tex</code> file, it use 
       <code>.dvi</code> file to store information including the position of the characters, but not the specific font that would be displayed. Later, <code>dvipdfmx</code> map the font. And further more, you can actually change the font not by changing the <code>.tex</code> file, but by applying an additional map when using <code>dvipdfmx</code>. </p>
       <p>Consequently, you can formatting Hanzi using upLaTeX. And there is vertical typesetting mode in upLaTeX. For <code>jlreq</code> class, just add parameter <code>tate</code> to the document class, viz., <code>\documentclass[tate]{jlreq}</code>. Thus you can formatting Hanzi vertically (after reading <a href="this article">this article</a>). </p>
       <p>Awesome.</p>
