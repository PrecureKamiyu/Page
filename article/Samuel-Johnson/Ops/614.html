<p class="p10"><span class="t7">INTRODUCTION TO &lsquo;A DICTIONARY OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE&rsquo;</span></p>
<p class="p16"><img src="images/img36.png" width="235" height="14" alt="img36.png"/></p>
<p class="p21">In 1746, a group of publishers approached Johnson about creating an authoritative dictionary of the English language and a contract with William Strahan and associates, worth 1,500 guineas, was signed on the morning of 18 June 1746. Johnson claimed that he could finish the project in three years. In comparison, the French equivalent, <span class="t8">Académie Française</span>, had forty scholars spending forty years to complete its dictionary, prompting Johnson to claim, &ldquo;This is the proportion. Let me see; forty times forty is sixteen hundred. As three to sixteen hundred, so is the proportion of an Englishman to a Frenchman&rdquo;. Although he did not succeed in completing the work in three years, he did manage to complete the dictionary in nine, justifying his boast. </p>
<p class="p22">Johnson&rsquo;s dictionary was not the first of its kind, nor was it unique. It was, however, the most commonly used and imitated for the 150 years between its first publication and the completion of the Oxford English Dictionary in 1928. Other dictionaries, such as Nathan Bailey&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Dictionarium Britannicum</span>, included more words and in the 150 years preceding Johnson&rsquo;s Dictionary about twenty other general-purpose monolingual dictionaries had been produced. However, there was open dissatisfaction with the dictionaries of the period and many inconsistencies with spellings and definitions. </p>
<p class="p22">Johnson&rsquo;s Dictionary was prepared at 17 Gough Square, London, an eclectic household, between the years of 1746 and 1755. By 1747 Johnson had written his Plan of a Dictionary of the English Language, which spelled out his intentions and proposed methodology for preparing his document. He clearly saw benefit in drawing from previous efforts, and saw the process as a parallel to legal precedent.</p>
<p class="p22"><span class="t8">A Dictionary of the English Language</span> was somewhat large and very expensive. Its pages were 18 inches tall and nearly 20 inches wide. The paper was of the finest quality available, the cost of which ran to nearly £1,600; more than Johnson had been paid to write the book. Johnson himself pronounced the book &ldquo;Vasta mole superbus&rdquo; (Proud in its great bulk). The original edition was published in two folio volumes, divided between letters A&ndash;K and L&ndash;Z. But that format soon proved unwieldy to use and unprofitable to sell. Subsequent printings ran to four volumes and even these formed a stack 10 inches and weighed almost 10kg. No bookseller could possibly hope to print this book without help; except for a few special editions of the Bible, no book of this heft and size had even been set to type before. </p>
<p class="p22">This first edition of the Dictionary contained a 42,773-word list, to which only a few more were added in subsequent editions. One of Johnson&rsquo;s important innovations was to illustrate the meanings of his words by literary quotations, of which there are around 114,000 examples, with quotations from authors such as Shakespeare, Spenser, Swift, Milton and Dryden.&nbsp; Furthermore, Johnson, unlike Bailey before him, added notes on a word&rsquo;s usage, rather than being merely descriptive. Johnson&rsquo;s work demonstrated a meticulousness and professionalism, which, unlike the proto-dictionaries that had come before, took painstaking care in the completeness of its definitions that was most likely what led to this Dictionary becoming the firm favourite of posterity.</p>
<p class="p22">Published on 15 April 1755, Johnson&rsquo;s Dictionary is among the most influential books in the history of the English language. Immediately after publication The Dictionary was enthusiastically reviewed in important periodicals such as the <span class="t8">London Magazine</span> and the <span class="t8">Gentleman&rsquo;s Magazine</span>, where it received an eight-page notice. Reviews were overall generous in tone and complimentary on Johnson&rsquo;s herculean achievement.</p>
<p class="p22">A selection of the original entries for the 1755 Dictionary are provided in this section of the eBook, with numerous definitions of words for every letter of the alphabet, allowing readers to appreciate the true flavour of Johnson&rsquo;s original text.</p>
