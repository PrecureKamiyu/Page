		   <h1>MathJax</h1>
		   <h2>What happen when you insert math formula in markdown.</h2>
		   <p>There is no such thing as the LaTeX in markdown. Most of the markdown previewer use MathJax or katex, which is 
		   not LaTeX nor TeX, but is the tool to render some math formula which is written as if it were LaTeX, where 
		   LaTeX is just an abstraction, a way to express the formula but not rendering it. Things get annoying especially 
		   when people start saying something like "Hey, I use markdown plus LaTeX".</p>
		   <p>Since MathJax is not doing what LaTeX doing, several drawbacks of MathJax is concerned 
		   (If there isn't any, I will not give a shit about whether MathJax is LaTeX or not). Okay, MathJax is just 
		   not precise enough, and the default font is very ugly.</p>

		   <h2>Employ MathJax in your website</h2>
		   <p>Just read the document of MathJax. Note that MathJax version 2 support different fonts while version 3 does not. If you are willing to change the font, you should check the documentation of MathJax version 2.</p>
		   
		   <h2>Change the font in your website</h2>
		   <p>Note that there is actually three ways to render your formula:</p>
		   <ol>
			<li>CHTML</li>
		   	<li>HTML+CSS</li>
			<li>SVG</li>
		   </ol>
		   <p>where CHTML only supports one font. You may change the configuration to HTML+CSS or SVG if you want to change the font.
		   The configuration is determined based on your source. Anyway, you may read the source code on current website for a check. After you change the configuration, read the documentation of MathJax font to change the configuration of SVG or HTML+CSS to display your preferred font.</p>
		   <p>There are four kinds of fonts available. </p>
		   <ol>
		   	<li>TeX, which is ugly under certain circumstances. </li>
			<li>STIX, which is ugly under most of the circumstances.</li>
			<li>Asana-Math, which is ugly under most of the circumstances, just like STIX.</li>
			<li>Neo-Euler, which is pretty cool because you rarely see it, and Knuth use this font in his book <i>Concrete Mathematics</i></li>
			<li>Latin-Modern, which is preferred since it suits CMU serif font best, but looks not so good because of SVG rendering. Here is an <a href="mathjax_example" target="_blank">exmaple</a> of Latin-Modern and CMU Serif.</li>
		   </ol>
		   <p>Here is some test in-line formula: \( a = b \), \(\sum_{n=1} ^{\infty} a_n\). The following is displayed formula:</p>
		   \[ G/\ker f \cong \text{Im}\, f\]
		   <p>where \(f \) is a homomorphism from \(G \) to \(G'\).</p>
