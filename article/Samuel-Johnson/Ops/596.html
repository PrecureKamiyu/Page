<h2 class="h20"><a id="a1262"></a>CHAPTER XXXIII</h2>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">THE PRINCESS MEETS WITH AN UNEXPECTED MISFORTUNE</span></p>
<p class="p21">They rose up, and returned through the cavity at which they had entered, and the princess prepared for her favourite a long narrative of dark labyrinths and costly rooms, and of the different impressions which the varieties of the way had made upon her. But when they came to their train, they found every one silent and dejected; the men discovered shame and fear in their countenances, and the women were weeping in the tents.</p>
<p class="p24">What had happened they did not try to conjecture, but immediately inquired. &ldquo;You had scarcely entered into the Pyramid,&rdquo; said one of the attendants, &ldquo;when a troop of Arabs rushed upon us; we were too few to resist them, and too slow to escape. They were about to search the tents, set us on our camels, and drive us along before them, when the approach of some Turkish horsemen put them to flight; but they seized the Lady Pekuah with her two maids, and carried them away. The Turks are now pursuing them by our instigation, but I fear they will not be able to overtake them.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">The princess was overpowered with surprise and grief. Rasselas, in the first heat of his resentment, ordered his servants to follow him, and prepared to pursue the robbers with his sabre in his hand. &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said Imlac, &ldquo;what can you hope from violence or valour? the Arabs are mounted on horses trained to battle and retreat; we have only beasts of burden. By leaving our present station we may lose the princess, but cannot hope to regain Pekuah.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">In a short time the Turks returned, having not been able to reach the enemy. The princess burst out into new lamentations, and Rasselas could scarcely forbear to reproach them with cowardice; but Imlac was of opinion that the escape of the Arabs was no addition to their misfortune, for perhaps they would have killed their captives rather than have resigned them.</p>
