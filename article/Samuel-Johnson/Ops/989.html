<h2 class="h20"><a id="ncx41119"></a>THE LIFE OF SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.</h2>
<p class="p21">Having left Ashbourne in the evening, we stopped to change horses at Derby, and availed ourselves of a moment to enjoy the conversation of my countryman, Dr. Butter, then physician there. He was in great indignation because Lord Mountstuart&rsquo;s bill for a Scotch militia had been lost. Dr. Johnson was as violent against it. &lsquo;I am glad, (said he,) that Parliament has had the spirit to throw it out. You wanted to take advantage of the timidity of our scoundrels;&rsquo; (meaning, I suppose, the ministry). It may be observed, that he used the epithet scoundrel very commonly not quite in the sense in which it is generally understood, but as a strong term of disapprobation; as when he abruptly answered Mrs. Thrale, who had asked him how he did, &lsquo;Ready to become a scoundrel, Madam; with a little more spoiling you will, I think, make me a complete rascal:&rsquo; he meant, easy to become a capricious and self-indulgent valetudinarian; a character for which I have heard him express great disgust.</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson had with him upon this jaunt, &lsquo;<span class="t8">Il Palmerino d&rsquo;Inghilterra</span>,&rsquo; a romance praised by Cervantes; but did not like it much. He said, he read it for the language, by way of preparation for his Italian expedition. &mdash; We lay this night at Loughborough.</p>
<p class="p24">On Thursday, March 28, we pursued our journey. I mentioned that old Mr. Sheridan complained of the ingratitude of Mr. Wedderburne and General Fraser, who had been much obliged to him when they were young Scotchmen entering upon life in England. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, a man is very apt to complain of the ingratitude of those who have risen far above him. A man when he gets into a higher sphere, into other habits of life, cannot keep up all his former connections. Then, Sir, those who knew him formerly upon a level with themselves, may think that they ought still to be treated as on a level, which cannot be; and an acquaintance in a former situation may bring out things which it would be very disagreeable to have mentioned before higher company, though, perhaps, every body knows of them.&rsquo; He placed this subject in a new light to me, and shewed that a man who has risen in the world, must not be condemned too harshly for being distant to former acquaintance, even though he may have been much obliged to them.&rsquo; It is, no doubt, to be wished that a proper degree of attention should be shewn by great men to their early friends. But if either from obtuse insensibility to difference of situation, or presumptuous forwardness, which will not submit even to an exteriour observance of it, the dignity of high place cannot be preserved, when they are admitted into the company of those raised above the state in which they once were, encroachment must be repelled, and the kinder feelings sacrificed. To one of the very fortunate persons whom I have mentioned, namely, Mr. Wedderburne, now Lord Loughborough, I must do the justice to relate, that I have been assured by another early acquaintance of his, old Mr. Macklin, who assisted in improving his pronunciation, that he found him very grateful. Macklin, I suppose, had not pressed upon his elevation with so much eagerness as the gentleman who complained of him. Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s remark as to the jealousy &lsquo;entertained of our friends who rise far above us,&rsquo; is certainly very just. By this was withered the early friendship between Charles Townshend and Akenside; and many similar instances might be adduced.</p>
<p class="p24">He said, &lsquo;It is commonly a weak man who marries for love.&rsquo; We then talked of marrying women of fortune; and I mentioned a common remark, that a man may be, upon the whole, richer by marrying a woman with a very small portion, because a woman of fortune will be proportionally expensive; whereas a woman who brings none will be very moderate in expenses. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Depend upon it, Sir, this is not true. A woman of fortune being used to the handling of money, spends it judiciously: but a woman who gets the command of money for the first time upon her marriage, has such a gust in spending it, that she throws it away with great profusion.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He praised the ladies of the present age, insisting that they were more faithful to their husbands, and more virtuous in every respect, than in former times, because their understandings were better cultivated. It was an undoubted proof of his good sense and good disposition, that he was never querulous, never prone to inveigh against the present times, as is so common when superficial minds are on the fret. On the contrary, he was willing to speak favourably of his own age; and, indeed, maintained its superiority in every respect, except in its reverence for government; the relaxation of which he imputed, as its grand cause, to the shock which our monarchy received at the Revolution, though necessary; and secondly, to the timid concessions made to faction by successive administrations in the reign of his present Majesty. I am happy to think, that he lived to see the Crown at last recover its just influence.</p>
<p class="p24">At Leicester we read in the news-paper that Dr. James was dead. I thought that the death of an old school-fellow, and one with whom he had lived a good deal in London, would have affected my fellow-traveller much: but he only said, &lsquo;Ah! poor Jamy.&rsquo; Afterwards, however, when we were in the chaise, he said, with more tenderness, &lsquo;Since I set out on this jaunt, I have lost an old friend and a young one; &mdash; Dr. James, and poor Harry.&rsquo; (Meaning Mr. Thrale&rsquo;s son.)</p>
<p class="p24">Having lain at St. Alban&rsquo;s, on Thursday, March 28, we breakfasted the next morning at Barnet. I expressed to him a weakness of mind which I could not help; an uneasy apprehension that my wife and children, who were at a great distance from me, might, perhaps, be ill. &lsquo;Sir, (said he,) consider how foolish you would think it in <span class="t8">them</span> to be apprehensive that <span class="t8">you</span> are ill.&rsquo; This sudden turn relieved me for the moment; but I afterwards perceived it to be an ingenious fallacy. I might, to be sure, be satisfied that they had no reason to be apprehensive about me, because I <span class="t8">knew</span> that I myself was well: but we might have a mutual anxiety, without the charge of folly; because each was, in some degree, uncertain as to the condition of the other.</p>
<p class="p24">I enjoyed the luxury of our approach to London, that metropolis which we both loved so much, for the high and varied intellectual pleasure which it furnishes. I experienced immediate happiness while whirled along with such a companion, and said to him, &lsquo;Sir, you observed one day at General Oglethorpe&rsquo;s, that a man is never happy for the present, but when he is drunk. Will you not add, &mdash; or when driving rapidly in a post-chaise?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;No, Sir, you are driving rapidly from something, or to something.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Talking of melancholy, he said, &lsquo;Some men, and very thinking men too, have not those vexing thoughts. Sir Joshua Reynolds is the same all the year round. Beauclerk, except when ill and in pain, is the same. But I believe most men have them in the degree in which they are capable of having them. If I were in the country, and were distressed by that malady, I would force myself to take a book; and every time I did it I should find it the easier. Melancholy, indeed, should be diverted by every means but drinking.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">We stopped at Messieurs Dillys, booksellers in the Poultry; from whence he hurried away, in a hackney coach, to Mr. Thrale&rsquo;s, in the Borough. I called at his house in the evening, having promised to acquaint Mrs. Williams of his safe return; when, to my surprize, I found him sitting with her at tea, and, as I thought, not in a very good humour: for, it seems, when he had got to Mr. Thrale&rsquo;s, he found the coach was at the door waiting to carry Mrs. and Miss Thrale, and Signor Baretti, their Italian master, to Bath. This was not shewing the attention which might have been expected to the &lsquo;Guide, Philosopher, and Friend,&rsquo; the <span class="t8">Imlac</span> who had hastened from the country to console a distressed mother, who he understood was very anxious for his return. They had, I found, without ceremony, proceeded on their intended journey. I was glad to understand from him that it was still resolved that his tour to Italy with Mr. and Mrs. Thrale should take place, of which he had entertained some doubt, on account of the loss which they had suffered; and his doubts afterwards proved to be well-founded. He observed, indeed very justly, that &lsquo;their loss was an additional reason for their going abroad; and if it had not been fixed that he should have been one of the party, he would force them out; but he would not advise them unless his advice was asked, lest they might suspect that he recommended what he wished on his own account.&rsquo; I was not pleased that his intimacy with Mr. Thrale&rsquo;s family, though it no doubt contributed much to his comfort and enjoyment, was not without some degree of restraint: not, as has been grossly suggested, that it was required of him as a task to talk for the entertainment of them and their company; but that he was not quite at his ease; which, however, might partly be owing to his own honest pride &mdash; that dignity of mind which is always jealous of appearing too compliant.</p>
<p class="p24">On Sunday, March 31, I called on him, and shewed him as a curiosity which I had discovered, his <span class="t8">Translation of Lobo&rsquo;s Account of Abyssinia</span>, which Sir John Pringle had lent me, it being then little known as one of his works. He said, &lsquo;Take no notice of it,&rsquo; or &lsquo;don&rsquo;t talk of it.&rsquo; He seemed to think it beneath him, though done at six-and-twenty. I said to him, &lsquo;Your style, Sir, is much improved since you translated this.&rsquo; He answered with a sort of triumphant smile, &lsquo;Sir, I hope it is.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Wednesday, April 3, in the morning I found him very busy putting his books in order, and as they were generally very old ones, clouds of dust were flying around him. He had on a pair of large gloves such as hedgers use. His present appearance put me in mind of my uncle, Dr. Boswell&rsquo;s description of him, &lsquo;A robust genius, born to grapple with whole libraries.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I gave him an account of a conversation which had passed between me and Captain Cook, the day before, at dinner at Sir John Pringle&rsquo;s; and he was much pleased with the conscientious accuracy of that celebrated circumnavigator, who set me right as to many of the exaggerated accounts given by Dr. Hawkesworth of his Voyages. I told him that while I was with the Captain, I catched the enthusiasm of curiosity and adventure, and felt a strong inclination to go with him on his next voyage. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, a man <span class="t8">does</span> feel so, till he considers how very little he can learn from such voyages.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;But one is carried away with the general grand and indistinct notion of A VOYAGE ROUND THE WORLD.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Yes, Sir, but a man is to guard himself against taking a thing in general.&rsquo; I said I was certain that a great part of what we are told by the travellers to the South Sea must be conjecture, because they had not enough of the language of those countries to understand so much as they have related. Objects falling under the observation of the senses might be clearly known; but every thing intellectual, every thing abstract &mdash; politicks, morals, and religion, must be darkly guessed. Dr. Johnson was of the same opinion. He upon another occasion, when a friend mentioned to him several extraordinary facts, as communicated to him by the circumnavigators, slily observed, &lsquo;Sir, I never before knew how much I was respected by these gentlemen; they told <span class="t8">me</span> none of these things.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He had been in company with Omai, a native of one of the South Sea Islands, after he had been some time in this country. He was struck with the elegance of his behaviour, and accounted for it thus: &lsquo;Sir, he had passed his time, while in England, only in the best company; so that all that he had acquired of our manners was genteel. As a proof of this, Sir, Lord Mulgrave and he dined one day at Streatham; they sat with their backs to the light fronting me, so that I could not see distinctly; and there was so little of the savage in Omai, that I was afraid to speak to either, lest I should mistake one for the other.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">We agreed to dine to-day at the Mitre-tavern, after the rising of the House of Lords, where a branch of the litigation concerning the Douglas Estate, in which I was one of the counsel, was to come on. I brought with me Mr. Murray, Solicitor-General of Scotland, now one of the Judges of the Court of Session, with the title of Lord Henderland. I mentioned Mr. Solicitor&rsquo;s relation, Lord Charles Hay, with whom I knew Dr. Johnson had been acquainted. JOHNSON. &lsquo;I wrote something for Lord Charles; and I thought he had nothing to fear from a court-martial. I suffered a great loss when he died; he was a mighty pleasing man in conversation, and a reading man. The character of a soldier is high. They who stand forth the foremost in danger, for the community, have the respect of mankind. An officer is much more respected than any other man who has as little money. In a commercial country, money will always purchase respect. But you find, an officer, who has, properly speaking, no money, is every where well received and treated with attention. The character of a soldier always stands him in stead.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Yet, Sir, I think that common soldiers are worse thought of than other men in the same rank of life; such as labourers.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, a common soldier is usually a very gross man, and any quality which procures respect may be overwhelmed by grossness. A man of learning may be so vicious or so ridiculous that you cannot respect him. A common soldier too, generally eats more than he can pay for. But when a common soldier is civil in his quarters, his red coat procures him a degree of respect.&rsquo; The peculiar respect paid to the military character in France was mentioned. BOSWELL. &lsquo;I should think that where military men are so numerous, they would be less valued as not being rare.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Nay, Sir, wherever a particular character or profession is high in the estimation of a people, those who are of it will be valued above other men. We value an Englishman highly in this country, and yet Englishmen are not rare in it.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Mr. Murray praised the ancient philosophers for the candour and good humour with which those of different sects disputed with each other. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, they disputed with good humour, because they were not in earnest as to religion. Had the ancients been serious in their belief, we should not have had their Gods exhibited in the manner we find them represented in the Poets. The people would not have suffered it. They disputed with good humour upon their fanciful theories, because they were not interested in the truth of them: when a man has nothing to lose, he may be in good humour with his opponent. Accordingly you see in Lucian, the Epicurean, who argues only negatively, keeps his temper; the Stoick, who has something positive to preserve, grows angry. Being angry with one who controverts an opinion which you value, is a necessary consequence of the uneasiness which you feel. Every man who attacks my belief, diminishes in some degree my confidence in it, and therefore makes me uneasy; and I am angry with him who makes me uneasy. Those only who believed in revelation have been angry at having their faith called in question; because they only had something upon which they could rest as matter of fact.&rsquo; MURRAY. &lsquo;It seems to me that we are not angry at a man for controverting an opinion which we believe and value; we rather pity him.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir; to be sure when you wish a man to have that belief which you think is of infinite advantage, you wish well to him; but your primary consideration is your own quiet. If a madman were to come into this room with a stick in his hand, no doubt we should pity the state of his mind; but our primary consideration would be to take care of ourselves. We should knock him down first, and pity him afterwards. No, Sir; every man will dispute with great good humour upon a subject in which he is not interested. I will dispute very calmly upon the probability of another man&rsquo;s son being hanged; but if a man zealously enforces the probability that my own son will be hanged, I shall certainly not be in a very good humour with him.&rsquo; I added this illustration, &lsquo;If a man endeavours to convince me that my wife, whom I love very much, and in whom I place great confidence, is a disagreeable woman, and is even unfaithful to me, I shall be very angry, for he is putting me in fear of being unhappy.&rsquo; MURRAY. &lsquo;But, Sir, truth will always bear an examination.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Yes, Sir, but it is painful to be forced to defend it. Consider, Sir, how should you like, though conscious of your innocence, to be tried before a jury for a capital crime, once a week.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">We talked of education at great schools; the advantages and disadvantages of which Johnson displayed in a luminous manner; but his arguments preponderated so much in favour of the benefit which a boy of good parts might receive at one of them, that I have reason to believe Mr. Murray was very much influenced by what he had heard to-day, in his determination to send his own son to Westminster school. &mdash; I have acted in the same manner with regard to my own two sons; having placed the eldest at Eton, and the second at Westminster. I cannot say which is best. But in justice to both those noble seminaries, I with high satisfaction declare, that my boys have derived from them a great deal of good, and no evil: and I trust they will, like Horace, be grateful to their father for giving them so valuable an education.</p>
<p class="p24">I introduced the topick, which is often ignorantly urged, that the Universities of England are too rich; so that learning does not flourish in them as it would do, if those who teach had smaller salaries, and depended on their assiduity for a great part of their income. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, the very reverse of this is the truth; the English Universities are not rich enough. Our fellowships are only sufficient to support a man during his studies to fit him for the world, and accordingly in general they are held no longer than till an opportunity offers of getting away. Now and then, perhaps, there is a fellow who grows old in his college; but this is against his will, unless he be a man very indolent indeed. A hundred a year is reckoned a good fellowship, and that is no more than is necessary to keep a man decently as a scholar. We do not allow our fellows to marry, because we consider academical institutions as preparatory to a settlement in the world. It is only by being employed as a tutor, that a fellow can obtain any thing more than a livelihood. To be sure a man, who has enough without teaching, will probably not teach; for we would all be idle if we could. In the same manner, a man who is to get nothing by teaching, will not exert himself. Gresham-College was intended as a place of instruction for London; able professors were to read lectures gratis, they contrived to have no scholars; whereas, if they had been allowed to receive but sixpence a lecture from each scholar, they would have been emulous to have had many scholars. Every body will agree that it should be the interest of those who teach to have scholars; and this is the case in our Universities. That they are too rich is certainly not true; for they have nothing good enough to keep a man of eminent learning with them for his life. In the foreign Universities a professorship is a high thing. It is as much almost as a man can make by his learning; and therefore we find the most learned men abroad are in the Universities. It is not so with us. Our Universities are impoverished of learning, by the penury of their provisions. I wish there were many places of a thousand a-year at Oxford, to keep first-rate men of learning from quitting the University.&rsquo; Undoubtedly if this were the case, Literature would have a still greater dignity and splendour at Oxford, and there would be grander living sources of instruction.</p>
<p class="p24">I mentioned Mr. Maclaurin&rsquo;s uneasiness on account of a degree of ridicule carelessly thrown on his deceased father, in Goldsmith&rsquo;s <span class="t8">History of Animated Nature</span>, in which that celebrated mathematician is represented as being subject to fits of yawning so violent as to render him incapable of proceeding in his lecture; a story altogether unfounded, but for the publication of which the law would give no reparation. This led us to agitate the question, whether legal redress could be obtained, even when a man&rsquo;s deceased relation was calumniated in a publication. Mr. Murray maintained there should be reparation, unless the author could justify himself by proving the fact. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, it is of so much more consequence that truth should be told, than that individuals should not be made uneasy, that it is much better that the law does not restrain writing freely concerning the characters of the dead. Damages will be given to a man who is calumniated in his life-time, because he may be hurt in his worldly interest, or at least hurt in his mind: but the law does not regard that uneasiness which a man feels on having his ancestor calumniated. That is too nice. Let him deny what is said, and let the matter have a fair chance by discussion. But, if a man could say nothing against a character but what he can prove, history could not be written; for a great deal is known of men of which proof cannot be brought. A minister may be notoriously known to take bribes, and yet you may not be able to prove it.&rsquo; Mr. Murray suggested, that the authour should be obliged to shew some sort of evidence, though he would not require a strict legal proof: but Johnson firmly and resolutely opposed any restraint whatever, as adverse to a free investigation of the characters of mankind.</p>
<p class="p24">On Thursday, April 4, having called on Dr. Johnson, I said, it was a pity that truth was not so firm as to bid defiance to all attacks, so that it might be shot at as much as people chose to attempt, and yet remain unhurt. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Then, Sir, it would not be shot at. Nobody attempts to dispute that two and two make four: but with contests concerning moral truth, human passions are generally mixed, and therefore it must ever be liable to assault and misrepresentation.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Friday, April 5, being Good Friday, after having attended the morning service at St. Clement&rsquo;s Church, I walked home with Johnson. We talked of the Roman Catholick religion. JOHNSON. &lsquo;In the barbarous ages, Sir, priests and people were equally deceived; but afterwards there were gross corruptions introduced by the clergy, such as indulgences to priests to have concubines, and the worship of images, not, indeed, inculcated, but knowingly permitted.&rsquo; He strongly censured the licensed stews at Rome. BOSWELL. &lsquo;So then, Sir, you would allow of no irregular intercourse whatever between the sexes?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;To be sure I would not, Sir. I would punish it much more than it is done, and so restrain it. In all countries there has been fornication, as in all countries there has been theft; but there may be more or less of the one, as well as of the other, in proportion to the force of law. All men will naturally commit fornication, as all men will naturally steal. And, Sir, it is very absurd to argue, as has been often done, that prostitutes are necessary to prevent the violent effects of appetite from violating the decent order of life; nay, should be permitted, in order to preserve the chastity of our wives and daughters. Depend upon it, Sir, severe laws, steadily enforced, would be sufficient against those evils, and would promote marriage.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I stated to him this case:&mdash; &lsquo;Suppose a man has a daughter, who he knows has been seduced, but her misfortune is concealed from the world? should he keep her in his house? Would he not, by doing so, be accessory to imposition? And, perhaps, a worthy, unsuspecting man might come and marry this woman, unless the father inform him of the truth.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, he is accessory to no imposition. His daughter is in his house; and if a man courts her, he takes his chance. If a friend, or, indeed, if any man asks his opinion whether he should marry her, he ought to advise him against it, without telling why, because his real opinion is then required. Or, if he has other daughters who know of her frailty, he ought not to keep her in his house. You are to consider the state of life is this; we are to judge of one another&rsquo;s characters as well as we can; and a man is not bound, in honesty or honour, to tell us the faults of his daughter or of himself. A man who has debauched his friend&rsquo;s daughter is not obliged to say to every body&mdash; &ldquo;Take care of me; don&rsquo;t let me into your houses without suspicion. I once debauched a friend&rsquo;s daughter. I may debauch yours.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Mr. Thrale called upon him, and appeared to bear the loss of his son with a manly composure. There was no affectation about him; and he talked, as usual, upon indifferent subjects. He seemed to me to hesitate as to the intended Italian tour, on which, I flattered myself, he and Mrs. Thrale and Dr. Johnson were soon to set out; and, therefore, I pressed it as much as I could. I mentioned, that Mr. Beauclerk had said, that Baretti, whom they were to carry with them, would keep them so long in the little towns of his own district, that they would not have time to see Rome. I mentioned this, to put them on their guard. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, we do not thank Mr. Beauclerk for supposing that we are to be directed by Baretti. No, Sir; Mr. Thrale is to go, by my advice, to Mr. Jackson, (the all-knowing) and get from him a plan for seeing the most that can be seen in the time that we have to travel. We must, to be sure, see Rome, Naples, Florence, and Venice, and as much more as we can.&rsquo; (Speaking with a tone of animation.)</p>
<p class="p24">When I expressed an earnest wish for his remarks on Italy, he said, &lsquo;I do not see that I could make a book upon Italy; yet I should be glad to get two hundred pounds, or five hundred pounds, by such a work.&rsquo; This shewed both that a journal of his Tour upon the Continent was not wholly out of his contemplation, and that he uniformly adhered to that strange opinion, which his indolent disposition made him utter: &lsquo;No man but a blockhead ever wrote, except for money.&rsquo; Numerous instances to refute this will occur to all who are versed in the history of literature.</p>
<p class="p24">He gave us one of the many sketches of character which were treasured in his mind, and which he was wont to produce quite unexpectedly in a very entertaining manner. &lsquo;I lately, (said he,) received a letter from the East Indies, from a gentleman whom I formerly knew very well; he had returned from that country with a handsome fortune, as it was reckoned, before means were found to acquire those immense sums which have been brought from thence of late; he was a scholar, and an agreeable man, and lived very prettily in London, till his wife died. After her death, he took to dissipation and gaming, and lost all he had. One evening he lost a thousand pounds to a gentleman whose name I am sorry I have forgotten. Next morning he sent the gentleman five hundred pounds, with an apology that it was all he had in the world. The gentleman sent the money back to him, declaring he would not accept of it; and adding, that if Mr. &mdash;&mdash; had occasion for five hundred pounds more, he would lend it to him. He resolved to go out again to the East Indies, and make his fortune anew. He got a considerable appointment, and I had some intention of accompanying him. Had I thought then as I do now, I should have gone: but, at that time, I had objections to quitting England.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">It was a very remarkable circumstance about Johnson, whom shallow observers have supposed to have been ignorant of the world, that very few men had seen greater variety of characters; and none could observe them better, as was evident from the strong, yet nice portraits which he often drew. I have frequently thought that if he had made out what the French call <span class="t8">une catalogue raisonnée</span> of all the people who had passed under his observation, it would have afforded a very rich fund of instruction and entertainment. The suddenness with which his accounts of some of them started out in conversation, was not less pleasing than surprising. I remember he once observed to me, &lsquo;It is wonderful, Sir, what is to be found in London. The most literary conversation that I ever enjoyed, was at the table of Jack Ellis, a money-scrivener behind the Royal Exchange, with whom I at one period used to dine generally once a week.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Volumes would be required to contain a list of his numerous and various acquaintance, none of whom he ever forgot; and could describe and discriminate them all with precision and vivacity. He associated with persons the most widely different in manners, abilities, rank and accomplishments. He was at once the companion of the brilliant Colonel Forrester of the Guards, who wrote <span class="t8">The Polite Philosopher</span>, and of the aukward and uncouth Robert Levet; of Lord Thurlow, and Mr. Sastres, the Italian master; and has dined one day with the beautiful, gay, and fascinating Lady Craven, and the next with good Mrs. Gardiner, the tallow-chandler, on Snow-hill.</p>
<p class="p24">On my expressing my wonder at his discovering so much of the knowledge peculiar to different professions, he told me, &lsquo;I learnt what I know of law, chiefly from Mr. Ballow, a very able man. I learnt some, too, from Chambers; but was not so teachable then. One is not willing to be taught by a young man.&rsquo; When I expressed a wish to know more about Mr. Ballow, Johnson said, &lsquo;Sir, I have seen him but once these twenty years. The tide of life has driven us different ways.&rsquo; I was sorry at the time to hear this; but whoever quits the creeks of private connections, and fairly gets into the great ocean of London, will, by imperceptible degrees, unavoidably experience such cessations of acquaintance.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;My knowledge of physick, (he added,) I learnt from Dr. James, whom I helped in writing the proposals for his <span class="t8">Dictionary</span> and also a little in the Dictionary itself. I also learnt from Dr. Lawrence, but was then grown more stubborn.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">A curious incident happened to-day, while Mr. Thrale and I sat with him. Francis announced that a large packet was brought to him from the post-office, said to have come from Lisbon, and it was charged <span class="t8">seven pounds ten shillings</span>. He would not receive it, supposing it to be some trick, nor did he even look at it. But upon enquiry afterwards he found that it was a real packet for him, from that very friend in the East Indies of whom he had been speaking; and the ship which carried it having come to Portugal, this packet, with others, had been put into the post-office at Lisbon.</p>
<p class="p24">I mentioned a new gaming-club, of which Mr. Beauclerk had given me an account, where the members played to a desperate extent. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Depend upon it, Sir, this is mere talk. <span class="t8">Who</span> is ruined by gaming? You will not find six instances in an age. There is a strange rout made about deep play: whereas you have many more people ruined by adventurous trade, and yet we do not hear such an outcry against it.&rsquo; THRALE. &lsquo;There may be few people absolutely ruined by deep play; but very many are much hurt in their circumstances by it.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Yes, Sir, and so are very many by other kinds of expence.&rsquo; I had heard him talk once before in the same manner; and at Oxford he said, &lsquo;he wished he had learnt to play at cards.&rsquo; The truth, however, is, that he loved to display his ingenuity in argument; and therefore would sometimes in conversation maintain opinions which he was sensible were wrong, but in supporting which, his reasoning and wit would be most conspicuous. He would begin thus: &lsquo;Why, Sir, as to the good or evil of card-playing&mdash; &lsquo; &lsquo;Now, (said Garrick,) he is thinking which side he shall take.&rsquo; He appeared to have a pleasure in contradiction, especially when any opinion whatever was delivered with an air of confidence; so that there was hardly any topick, if not one of the great truths of Religion and Morality, that he might not have been incited to argue, either for or against. Lord Elibank had the highest admiration of his powers. He once observed to me, &lsquo;Whatever opinion Johnson maintains, I will not say that he convinces me; but he never fails to shew me, that he has good reasons for it.&rsquo; I have heard Johnson pay his Lordship this high compliment: &lsquo;I never was in Lord Elibank&rsquo;s company without learning something.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">We sat together till it was too late for the afternoon service. Thrale said he had come with intention to go to church with us. We went at seven to evening prayers at St. Clement&rsquo;s church, after having drank coffee; an indulgence, which I understood Johnson yielded to on this occasion, in compliment to Thrale.</p>
<p class="p24">On Sunday, April 7, Easter-day, after having been at St. Paul&rsquo;s Cathedral, I came to Dr. Johnson, according to my usual custom. It seemed to me, that there was always something peculiarly mild and placid in his manner upon this holy festival, the commemoration of the most joyful event in the history of our world, the resurrection of our LORD and SAVIOUR, who, having triumphed over death and the grave, proclaimed immortality to mankind.</p>
<p class="p24">I repeated to him an argument of a lady of my acquaintance, who maintained, that her husband&rsquo;s having been guilty of numberless infidelities, released her from conjugal obligations, because they were reciprocal. JOHNSON. &lsquo;This is miserable stuff, Sir. To the contract of marriage, besides the man and wife, there is a third party &mdash; Society; and if it be considered as a vow &mdash; GOD: and, therefore, it cannot be dissolved by their consent alone. Laws are not made for particular cases, but for men in general. A woman may be unhappy with her husband; but she cannot be freed from him without the approbation of the civil and ecclesiastical power. A man may be unhappy, because he is not so rich as another; but he is not to seize upon another&rsquo;s property with his own hand.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;But, Sir, this lady does not want that the contract should be dissolved; she only argues that she may indulge herself in gallantries with equal freedom as her husband does, provided she takes care not to introduce a spurious issue into his family. You know, Sir, what Macrobius has told us of Julia.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;This lady of yours, Sir, I think, is very fit for a brothel.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Mr. Macbean, authour of the <span class="t8">Dictionary of ancient Geography</span>, came in. He mentioned that he had been forty years absent from Scotland. &lsquo;Ah, Boswell! (said Johnson, smiling,) what would you give to be forty years from Scotland?&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;I should not like to be so long absent from the seat of my ancestors.&rsquo; This gentleman, Mrs. Williams, and Mr. Levet, dined with us.</p>
<p class="p24">Dr. Johnson made a remark, which both Mr. Macbean and I thought new. It was this: that &lsquo;the law against usury is for the protection of creditors as well as of debtors; for if there were no such check, people would be apt, from the temptation of great interest, to lend to desperate persons, by whom they would lose their money. Accordingly there are instances of ladies being ruined, by having injudiciously sunk their fortunes for high annuities, which, after a few years, ceased to be paid, in consequence of the ruined circumstances of the borrower.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Mrs. Williams was very peevish; and I wondered at Johnson&rsquo;s patience with her now, as I had often done on similar occasions. The truth is, that his humane consideration of the forlorn and indigent state in which this lady was left by her father, induced him to treat her with the utmost tenderness, and even to be desirous of procuring her amusement, so as sometimes to incommode many of his friends, by carrying her with him to their houses, where, from her manner of eating, in consequence of her blindness, she could not but offend the delicacy of persons of nice sensations.</p>
<p class="p24">After coffee, we went to afternoon service in St. Clement&rsquo;s church. Observing some beggars in the street as we walked along, I said to him I supposed there was no civilised country in the world, where the misery of want in the lowest classes of the people was prevented. JOHNSON. &lsquo;I believe, Sir, there is not; but it is better that some should be unhappy, than that none should be happy, which would be the case in a general state of equality.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">When the service was ended, I went home with him, and we sat quietly by ourselves. He recommended Dr. Cheyne&rsquo;s books. I said, I thought Cheyne had been reckoned whimsical. &lsquo;So he was, (said he,) in some things; but there is no end of objections. There are few books to which some objection or other may not be made.&rsquo; He added, &lsquo;I would not have you read anything else of Cheyne, but his book on Health, and his <span class="t8">English Malady</span>.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Upon the question whether a man who had been guilty of vicious actions would do well to force himself into solitude and sadness; JOHNSON. &lsquo;No, Sir, unless it prevent him from being vicious again. With some people, gloomy penitence is only madness turned upside down. A man may be gloomy, till, in order to be relieved from gloom, he has recourse again to criminal indulgencies.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Wednesday, April 10, I dined with him at Mr. Thrale&rsquo;s, where were Mr. Murphy and some other company. Before dinner, Dr. Johnson and I passed some time by ourselves. I was sorry to find it was now resolved that the proposed journey to Italy should not take place this year. He said, &lsquo;I am disappointed, to be sure; but it is not a great disappointment.&rsquo; I wondered to see him bear, with a philosophical calmness, what would have made most people peevish and fretful. I perceived, however, that he had so warmly cherished the hope of enjoying classical scenes, that he could not easily part with the scheme; for he said, &lsquo;I shall probably contrive to get to Italy some other way. But I won&rsquo;t mention it to Mr. and Mrs. Thrale, as it might vex them.&rsquo; I suggested, that going to Italy might have done Mr. and Mrs. Thrale good. JOHNSON. &lsquo;I rather believe not, Sir. While grief is fresh, every attempt to divert only irritates. You must wait till grief be <span class="t8">digested</span>, and then amusement will dissipate the remains of it.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">At dinner, Mr. Murphy entertained us with the history of Mr. Joseph Simpson, a schoolfellow of Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s, a barrister at law, of good parts, but who fell into a dissipated course of life, incompatible with that success in his profession which he once had, and would otherwise have deservedly maintained; yet he still preserved a dignity in his deportment. He wrote a tragedy on the story of Leonidas, entitled <span class="t8">The Patriot</span>. He read it to a company of lawyers, who found so many faults, that he wrote it over again: so then there were two tragedies on the same subject and with the same title. Dr. Johnson told us, that one of them was still in his possession. This very piece was, after his death, published by some person who had been about him, and, for the sake of a little hasty profit, was fallaciously advertised, so as to make it be believed to have been written by Johnson himself.</p>
<p class="p24">I said, I disliked the custom which some people had of bringing their children into company, because it in a manner forced us to pay foolish compliments to please their parents. JOHNSON. &lsquo;You are right, Sir. We may be excused for not caring much about other people&rsquo;s children, for there are many who care very little about their own children. It may be observed, that men, who from being engaged in business, or from their course of life in whatever way, seldom see their children, do not care much about them. I myself should not have had much fondness for a child of my own.&rsquo; MRS. THRALE. &lsquo;Nay, Sir, how can you talk so?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;At least, I never wished to have a child.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Mr. Murphy mentioned Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s having a design to publish an edition of <span class="t8">Cowley</span>. Johnson said, he did not know but he should; and he expressed his disapprobation of Dr. Hurd, for having published a mutilated edition under the title of <span class="t8">Select Works of Abraham Cowley</span>. Mr. Murphy thought it a bad precedent; observing that any authour might be used in the same manner; and that it was pleasing to see the variety of an authour&rsquo;s compositions, at different periods.</p>
<p class="p24">We talked of Flatman&rsquo;s Poems; and Mrs. Thrale observed, that Pope had partly borrowed from him <span class="t8">The dying Christian to his Soul</span>. Johnson repeated Rochester&rsquo;s verses upon Flatman, which I think by much too severe:</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;Nor that slow drudge in swift Pindarick strains,<br/>Flatman, who Cowley imitates with pains,<br/>And rides a jaded Muse, whipt with loose reins.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I like to recollect all the passages that I heard Johnson repeat: it stamps a value on them.</p>
<p class="p24">He told us, that the book entitled <span class="t8">The Lives of the Poets</span>, by Mr. Cibber, was entirely compiled by Mr. Shiels, a Scotchman, one of his amanuenses. &lsquo;The bookseller (said he,) gave Theophilus Cibber, who was then in prison, ten guineas, to allow <span class="t8">Mr. Cibber</span> to be put upon the title-page, as the authour; by this, a double imposition was intended: in the first place, that it was the work of a Cibber at all; and, in the second place, that it was the work of old Cibber.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Mr. Murphy said, that <span class="t8">The Memoirs of Gray&rsquo;s Life</span> set him much higher in his estimation than his poems did; &lsquo;for you there saw a man constantly at work in literature.&rsquo; Johnson acquiesced in this; but depreciated the book, I thought, very unreasonably. For he said, &lsquo;I forced myself to read it, only because it was a common topick of conversation. I found it mighty dull; and, as to the style, it is fit for the second table.&rsquo; Why he thought so I was at a loss to conceive. He now gave it as his opinion, that &lsquo;Akenside was a superiour poet both to Gray and Mason.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Talking of the Reviews, Johnson said, &lsquo;I think them very impartial: I do not know an instance of partiality.&rsquo; He mentioned what had passed upon the subject of the <span class="t8">Monthly</span> and <span class="t8">Critical Reviews</span>, in the conversation with which his Majesty had honoured him. He expatiated a little more on them this evening. &lsquo;The Monthly Reviewers (said he) are not Deists; but they are Christians with as little christianity as may be; and are for pulling down all establishments. The Critical Reviewers are for supporting the constitution both in church and state. The Critical Reviewers, I believe, often review without reading the books through; but lay hold of a topick, and write chiefly from their own minds. The Monthly Reviewers are duller men, and are glad to read the books through.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He talked of Lord Lyttelton&rsquo;s extreme anxiety as an authour; observing, that &lsquo;he was thirty years in preparing his <span class="t8">History</span>, and that he employed a man to point it for him; as if (laughing) another man could point his sense better than himself.&rsquo; Mr. Murphy said, he understood his history was kept back several years for fear of Smollet. JOHNSON. &lsquo;This seems strange to Murphy and me, who never felt that anxiety, but sent what we wrote to the press, and let it take its chance.&rsquo; MRS. THRALE. &lsquo;The time has been, Sir, when you felt it.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why really, Madam, I do not recollect a time when that was the case.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Talking of <span class="t8">The Spectator</span>, he said, &lsquo;It is wonderful that there is such a proportion of bad papers, in the half of the work which was not written by Addison; for there was all the world to write that half, yet not a half of that half is good. One of the finest pieces in the English language is the paper on Novelty, yet we do not hear it talked of. It was written by Grove, a dissenting <span class="t8">teacher</span>.&rsquo; He would not, I perceived, call him a <span class="t8">clergyman</span>, though he was candid enough to allow very great merit to his composition. Mr. Murphy said, he remembered when there were several people alive in London, who enjoyed a considerable reputation merely from having written a paper in <span class="t8">The Spectator</span>. He mentioned particularly Mr. Ince, who used to frequent Tom&rsquo;s coffee-house. &lsquo;But (said Johnson,) you must consider how highly Steele speaks of Mr. Ince.&rsquo; He would not allow that the paper on carrying a boy to travel, signed <span class="t8">Philip Homebred</span>, which was reported to be written by the Lord Chancellor Hardwicke, had merit. He said, &lsquo;it was quite vulgar, and had nothing luminous.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson mentioned Dr. Barry&rsquo;s System of Physick. &lsquo;He was a man (said he,) who had acquired a high reputation in Dublin, came over to England, and brought his reputation with him, but had not great success. His notion was, that pulsation occasions death by attrition; and that, therefore, the way to preserve life is to retard pulsation. But we know that pulsation is strongest in infants, and that we increase in growth while it operates in its regular course; so it cannot be the cause of destruction.&rsquo; Soon after this, he said something very flattering to Mrs. Thrale, which I do not recollect; but it concluded with wishing her long life. &lsquo;Sir, (said I,) if Dr. Barry&rsquo;s system be true, you have now shortened Mrs. Thrale&rsquo;s life, perhaps, some minutes, by accelerating her pulsation.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Thursday, April 11, I dined with him at General Paoli&rsquo;s, in whose house I now resided, and where I had ever afterwards the honour of being entertained with the kindest attention as his constant guest, while I was in London, till I had a house of my own there. I mentioned my having that morning introduced to Mr. Garrick, Count Neni, a Flemish Nobleman of great rank and fortune, to whom Garrick talked of Abel Drugger as <span class="t8">a small part</span>; and related, with pleasant vanity, that a Frenchman who had seen him in one of his low characters, exclaimed, &lsquo;<span class="t8">Comment! je ne le crois pas. Ce n&rsquo;est pas Monsieur Garrick, ce Grand Homme</span>!&rsquo; Garrick added, with an appearance of grave recollection, &lsquo;If I were to begin life again, I think I should not play those low characters.&rsquo; Upon which I observed, &lsquo;Sir, you would be in the wrong; for your great excellence is your variety of playing, your representing so well, characters so very different.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Garrick, Sir, was not in earnest in what he said; for, to be sure, his peculiar excellence is his variety: and, perhaps, there is not any one character which has not been as well acted by somebody else, as he could do it.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Why then, Sir, did he talk so?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, to make you answer as you did.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know, Sir; he seemed to dip deep into his mind for the reflection.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;He had not far to dip, Sir: he said the same thing, probably, twenty times before.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Of a nobleman raised at a very early period to high office, he said, &lsquo;His parts, Sir, are pretty well for a Lord; but would not be distinguished in a man who had nothing else but his parts&rsquo;.</p>
<p class="p24">A journey to Italy was still in his thoughts. He said, &lsquo;A man who has not been in Italy, is always conscious of an inferiority, from his not having seen what it is expected a man should see. The grand object of travelling is to see the shores of the Mediterranean. On those shores were the four great Empires of the world; the Assyrian, the Persian, the Grecian, and the Roman. &mdash; All our religion, almost all our law, almost all our arts, almost all that sets us above savages, has come to us from the shores of the Mediterranean.&rsquo; The General observed, that &lsquo;THE MEDITERRANEAN would be a noble subject for a poem.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">We talked of translation. I said, I could not define it, nor could I think of a similitude to illustrate it; but that it appeared to me the translation of poetry could be only imitation. JOHNSON. &lsquo;You may translate books of science exactly. You may also translate history, in so far as it is not embellished with oratory, which is poetical. Poetry, indeed, cannot be translated; and, therefore, it is the poets that preserve languages; for we would not be at the trouble to learn a language, if we could have all that is written in it just as well in a translation. But as the beauties of poetry cannot be preserved in any language except that in which it was originally written, we learn the language.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">A gentleman maintained that the art of printing had hurt real learning, by disseminating idle writings. &mdash; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, if it had not been for the art of printing, we should now have no learning at all; for books would have perished faster than they could have been transcribed.&rsquo; This observation seems not just, considering for how many ages books were preserved by writing alone.</p>
<p class="p24">The same gentleman maintained, that a general diffusion of knowledge among a people was a disadvantage; for it made the vulgar rise above their humble sphere. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, while knowledge is a distinction, those who are possessed of it will naturally rise above those who are not. Merely to read and write was a distinction at first; but we see when reading and writing have become general, the common people keep their stations. And so, were higher attainments to become general the effect would be the same.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Goldsmith (he said), referred every thing to vanity; his virtues, and his vices too, were from that motive. He was not a social man. He never exchanged mind with you.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">We spent the evening at Mr. Hoole&rsquo;s. Mr. Mickle, the excellent translator of <span class="t8">The Lusiad</span>, was there. I have preserved little of the conversation of this evening. Dr. Johnson said, &lsquo;Thomson had a true poetical genius, the power of viewing every thing in a poetical light. His fault is such a cloud of words sometimes, that the sense can hardly peep through. Shiels, who compiled <span class="t8">Cibber&rsquo;s Lives of the Poets</span>, was one day sitting with me. I took down Thomson, and read aloud a large portion of him, and then asked, &mdash; Is not this fine? Shiels having expressed the highest admiration. Well, Sir, (said I,) I have omitted every other line.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I related a dispute between Goldsmith and Mr. Robert Dodsley, one day when they and I were dining at Tom Davies&rsquo;s, in 1762. Goldsmith asserted, that there was no poetry produced in this age. Dodsley appealed to his own <span class="t8">Collection</span>, and maintained, that though you could not find a palace like Dryden&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Ode on St. Cecilia&rsquo;s Day</span>, you had villages composed of very pretty houses; and he mentioned particularly <span class="t8">The Spleen</span>. JOHNSON. &lsquo;I think Dodsley gave up the question. He and Goldsmith said the same thing; only he said it in a softer manner than Goldsmith did; for he acknowledged that there was no poetry, nothing that towered above the common mark. You may find wit and humour in verse, and yet no poetry. <span class="t8">Hudibras</span> has a profusion of these; yet it is not to be reckoned a poem. <span class="t8">The Spleen</span>, in Dodsley&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Collection</span>, on which you say he chiefly rested, is not poetry.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Does not Gray&rsquo;s poetry, Sir, tower above the common mark?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Yes, Sir; but we must attend to the difference between what men in general cannot do if they would, and what every man may do if he would. Sixteen-string Jack towered above the common mark.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Then, Sir, what is poetry?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, it is much easier to say what it is not. We all <span class="t8">know</span> what light is; but it is not easy to <span class="t8">tell</span> what it is.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Friday, April 12, I dined with him at our friend Tom Davies&rsquo;s, where we met Mr. Cradock, of Leicestershire, authour of <span class="t8">Zobeide</span>, a tragedy; a very pleasing gentleman, to whom my friend Dr. Farmer&rsquo;s very excellent <span class="t8">Essay on the Learning of Shakspeare</span> is addressed; and Dr. Harwood, who has written and published various works; particularly a fantastical translation of the New Testament, in modern phrase, and with a Socinian twist.</p>
<p class="p24">I introduced Aristotle&rsquo;s doctrine in his <span class="t8">Art of Poetry</span>, of &lsquo;the [Greek: katharis ton pathaematon], the purging of the passions,&rsquo; as the purpose of tragedy. &lsquo;But how are the passions to be purged by terrour and pity?&rsquo; (said I, with an assumed air of ignorance, to incite him to talk, for which it was often necessary to employ some address). JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, you are to consider what is the meaning of purging in the original sense. It is to expel impurities from the human body. The mind is subject to the same imperfection. The passions are the great movers of human actions; but they are mixed with such impurities, that it is necessary they should be purged or refined by means of terrour and pity. For instance, ambition is a noble passion; but by seeing upon the stage, that a man who is so excessively ambitious as to raise himself by injustice, is punished, we are terrified at the fatal consequences of such a passion. In the same manner a certain degree of resentment is necessary; but if we see that a man carries it too far, we pity the object of it, and are taught to moderate that passion.&rsquo; My record upon this occasion does great injustice to Johnson&rsquo;s expression, which was so forcible and brilliant, that Mr. Cradock whispered me, &lsquo;O that his words were written in a book!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I observed, the great defect of the tragedy of <span class="t8">Othello</span> was, that it had not a moral; for that no man could resist the circumstances of suspicion which were artfully suggested to Othello&rsquo;s mind. JOHNSON. &lsquo;In the first place, Sir, we learn from <span class="t8">Othello</span> this very useful moral, not to make an unequal match; in the second place, we learn not to yield too readily to suspicion. The handkerchief is merely a trick, though a very pretty trick; but there are no other circumstances of reasonable suspicion, except what is related by Iago of Cassio&rsquo;s warm expressions concerning Desdemona in his sleep; and that depended entirely upon the assertion of one man. No, Sir, I think <span class="t8">Othello</span> has more moral than almost any play.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Talking of a penurious gentleman of our acquaintance, Johnson said, &lsquo;Sir, he is narrow, not so much from avarice, as from impotence to spend his money. He cannot find in his heart to pour out a bottle of wine; but he would not much care if it should sour.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He said, he wished to see John Dennis&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Critical Works</span> collected. Davies said they would not sell. Dr. Johnson seemed to think otherwise.</p>
<p class="p24">Davies said of a well-known dramatick authour, that &lsquo;he lived upon <span class="t8">potted stories</span>, and that he made his way as Hannibal did, by vinegar; having begun by attacking people; particularly the players.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He reminded Dr. Johnson of Mr. Murphy&rsquo;s having paid him the highest compliment that ever was paid to a layman, by asking his pardon for repeating some oaths in the course of telling a story.</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson and I supt this evening at the Crown and Anchor tavern, in company with Sir Joshua Reynolds, Mr. Langton, Mr. Nairne, now one of the Scotch Judges, with the title of Lord Dunsinan, and my very worthy friend, Sir William Forbes, of Pitsligo.</p>
<p class="p24">We discussed the question whether drinking improved conversation and benevolence. Sir Joshua maintained it did. JOHNSON. &lsquo;No, Sir: before dinner men meet with great inequality of understanding; and those who are conscious of their inferiority, have the modesty not to talk. When they have drunk wine, every man feels himself happy, and loses that modesty, and grows impudent and vociferous: but he is not improved; he is only not sensible of his defects.&rsquo; Sir Joshua said the Doctor was talking of the effects of excess in wine; but that a moderate glass enlivened the mind, by giving a proper circulation to the blood. &lsquo;I am (said he,) in very good spirits, when I get up in the morning. By dinner-time I am exhausted; wine puts me in the same state as when I got up; and I am sure that moderate drinking makes people talk better.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;No, Sir; wine gives not light, gay, ideal hilarity; but tumultuous, noisy, clamorous merriment. I have heard none of those drunken, &mdash; nay, drunken is a coarse word, &mdash; none of those <span class="t8">vinous</span> flights.&rsquo; SIR JOSHUA. &lsquo;Because you have sat by, quite sober, and felt an envy of the happiness of those who were drinking.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Perhaps, contempt. &mdash; And, Sir, it is not necessary to be drunk one&rsquo;s self, to relish the wit of drunkenness. Do we not judge of the drunken wit, of the dialogue between Iago and Cassio, the most excellent in its kind, when we are quite sober? Wit is wit, by whatever means it is produced; and, if good, will appear so at all times. I admit that the spirits are raised by drinking, as by the common participation of any pleasure: cock-fighting, or bear-baiting, will raise the spirits of a company, as drinking does, though surely they will not improve conversation. I also admit, that there are some sluggish men who are improved by drinking; as there are fruits which are not good till they are rotten. There are such men, but they are medlars. I indeed allow that there have been a very few men of talents who were improved by drinking; but I maintain that I am right as to the effects of drinking in general: and let it be considered, that there is no position, however false in its universality, which is not true of some particular man.&rsquo; Sir William Forbes said, &lsquo;Might not a man warmed with wine be like a bottle of beer, which is made brisker by being set before the fire?&rsquo; &lsquo;Nay, (said Johnson, laughing,) I cannot answer that: that is too much for me.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I observed, that wine did some people harm, by inflaming, confusing, and irritating their minds; but that the experience of mankind had declared in favour of moderate drinking. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, I do not say it is wrong to produce self complacency by drinking; I only deny that it improves the mind. When I drank wine, I scorned to drink it when in company. I have drunk many a bottle by myself; in the first place, because I had need of it to raise my spirits; in the second place, because I would have nobody to witness its effects upon me.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He told us, &lsquo;almost all his <span class="t8">Ramblers</span> were written just as they were wanted for the press; that he sent a certain portion of the copy of an essay, and wrote the remainder, while the former part of it was printing. When it was wanted, and he had fairly sat down to it, he was sure it would be done.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He said, that for general improvement, a man should read whatever his immediate inclination prompts him to; though, to be sure, if a man has a science to learn, he must regularly and resolutely advance. He added, &lsquo;what we read with inclination makes a much stronger impression. If we read without inclination, half the mind is employed in fixing the attention; so there is but one half to be employed on what we read.&rsquo; He told us, he read Fielding&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Amelia</span> through without stopping. He said, &lsquo;if a man begins to read in the middle of a book, and feels an inclination to go on, let him not quit it, to go to the beginning. He may perhaps not feel again the inclination.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Sir Joshua mentioned Mr. Cumberland&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Odes</span>, which were just published. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, they would have been thought as good as Odes commonly are, if Cumberland had not put his name to them; but a name immediately draws censure, unless it be a name that bears down everything before it. Nay, Cumberland has made his <span class="t8">Odes</span> subsidiary to the fame of another man. They might have run well enough by themselves; but he has not only loaded them with a name, but has made them carry double.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">We talked of the Reviews, and Dr. Johnson spoke of them as he did at Thrale&rsquo;s. Sir Joshua said, what I have often thought, that he wondered to find so much good writing employed in them, when the authours were to remain unknown, and so could not have the motive of fame. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Nay, Sir, those who write in them, write well, in order to be paid well.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Soon after this day, he went to Bath with Mr. and Mrs. Thrale. I had never seen that beautiful city, and wished to take the opportunity of visiting it, while Johnson was there. Having written to him, I received the following answer.</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;To JAMES BOSWELL, ESQ.<br/>&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Why do you talk of neglect? When did I neglect you? If you will come to Bath, we shall all be glad to see you. Come, therefore, as soon as you can.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;But I have a little business for you at London. Bid Francis look in the paper-drawer of the chest of drawers in my bed-chamber, for two cases; one for the Attorney-General, and one for the Solicitor-General. They lie, I think, at the top of my papers; otherwise they are somewhere else, and will give me more trouble.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Please to write to me immediately, if they can be found. Make my compliments to all our friends round the world, and to Mrs. Williams at home.</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;I am, Sir, your, &amp;c.<br/>&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Search for the papers as soon as you can, that, if it is necessary, I may write to you again before you come down.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On the 26th of April, I went to Bath; and on my arrival at the Pelican inn, found lying for me an obliging invitation from Mr. and Mrs. Thrale, by whom I was agreeably entertained almost constantly during my stay. They were gone to the rooms; but there was a kind note from Dr. Johnson, that he should sit at home all the evening. I went to him directly, and before Mr. and Mrs. Thrale returned, we had by ourselves some hours of tea-drinking and talk.</p>
<p class="p24">I shall group together such of his sayings as I preserved during the few days that I was at Bath.</p>
<p class="p24">Of a person who differed from him in politicks, he said, &lsquo;In private life he is a very honest gentleman; but I will not allow him to be so in publick life. People <span class="t8">may</span> be honest, though they are doing wrong: that is, between their Maker and them. But <span class="t8">we</span>, who are suffering by their pernicious conduct, are to destroy them. We are sure that &mdash;&mdash; acts from interest. We know what his genuine principles were. They who allow their passions to confound the distinctions between right and wrong, are criminal. They may be convinced; but they have not come honestly by their conviction.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">It having been mentioned, I know not with what truth, that a certain female political writer, whose doctrines he disliked, had of late become very fond of dress, sat hours together at her toilet, and even put on rouge: &mdash; JOHNSON. &lsquo;She is better employed at her toilet, than using her pen. It is better she should be reddening her own cheeks, than blackening other people&rsquo;s characters.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He told us that &lsquo;Addison wrote Budgell&rsquo;s papers in the <span class="t8">Spectator</span>, at least mended them so much, that he made them almost his own; and that Draper, Tonson&rsquo;s partner, assured Mrs. Johnson, that the much admired Epilogue to <span class="t8">The Distressed Mother</span>, which came out in Budgell&rsquo;s name, was in reality written by Addison.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The mode of government by one may be ill adapted to a small society, but is best for a great nation. The characteristick of our own government at present is imbecility. The magistrate dare not call the guards for fear of being hanged. The guards will not come, for fear of being given up to the blind rage of popular juries.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Of the father of one of our friends, he observed, &lsquo;He never clarified his notions, by filtrating them through other minds. He had a canal upon his estate, where at one place the bank was too low. &mdash; I dug the canal deeper,&rsquo; said he.</p>
<p class="p24">He told me that &lsquo;so long ago as 1748 he had read &ldquo;<span class="t8">The Grave</span>, a Poem,&rdquo; but did not like it much.&rsquo; I differed from him; for though it is not equal throughout, and is seldom elegantly correct, it abounds in solemn thought, and poetical imagery beyond the common reach. The world has differed from him; for the poem has passed through many editions, and is still much read by people of a serious cast of mind.</p>
<p class="p24">A literary lady of large fortune was mentioned, as one who did good to many, but by no means &lsquo;by stealth,&rsquo; and instead of &lsquo;blushing to find it fame, acted evidently from vanity. JOHNSON. &lsquo;I have seen no beings who do as much good from benevolence, as she does, from whatever motive. If there are such under the earth, or in the clouds, I wish they would come up, or come down. What Soame Jenyns says upon this subject is not to be minded; he is a wit. No, Sir; to act from pure benevolence is not possible for finite beings. Human benevolence is mingled with vanity, interest, or some other motive.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He would not allow me to praise a lady then at Bath; observing &lsquo;She does not gain upon me, Sir; I think her empty-headed.&rsquo; He was, indeed, a stern critick upon characters and manners. Even Mrs. Thrale did not escape his friendly animadversion at times. When he and I were one day endeavouring to ascertain, article by article, how one of our friends could possibly spend as much money in his family as he told us he did, she interrupted us by a lively extravagant sally, on the expence of clothing his children, describing it in a very ludicrous and fanciful manner. Johnson looked a little angry, and said, &lsquo;Nay, Madam, when you are declaiming, declaim; and when you are calculating, calculate.&rsquo; At another time, when she said, perhaps affectedly, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t like to fly.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;With <span class="t8">your</span> wings, Madam, you <span class="t8">must</span> fly: but have a care, there are <span class="t8">clippers</span> abroad.&rsquo; How very well was this said, and how fully has experience proved the truth of it! But have they not <span class="t8">clipped</span> rather <span class="t8">rudely</span>, and gone a great deal <span class="t8">closer</span> than was necessary?</p>
<p class="p24">A gentleman expressed a wish to go and live three years at Otaheité, or New-Zealand, in order to obtain a full acquaintance with people, so totally different from all that we have ever known, and be satisfied what pure nature can do for man. JOHNSON. &lsquo;What could you learn, Sir? What can savages tell, but what they themselves have seen? Of the past, or the invisible, they can tell nothing. The inhabitants of Otaheité and New-Zealand are not in a state of pure nature; for it is plain they broke off from some other people. Had they grown out of the ground, you might have judged of a state of pure nature. Fanciful people may talk of a mythology being amongst them; but it must be invention. They have once had religion, which has been gradually debased. And what account of their religion can you suppose to be learnt from savages? Only consider, Sir, our own state: our religion is in a book; we have an order of men whose duty it is to teach it; we have one day in the week set apart for it, and this is in general pretty well observed: yet ask the first ten gross men you meet, and hear what they can tell of their religion.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Monday, April 29, he and I made an excursion to Bristol, where I was entertained with seeing him enquire upon the spot, into the authenticity of &lsquo;Rowley&rsquo;s Poetry,&rsquo; as I had seen him enquire upon the spot into the authenticity of &lsquo;Ossian&rsquo;s Poetry.&rsquo; George Catcot, the pewterer, who was as zealous for Rowley, as Dr. Hugh Blair was for Ossian, (I trust my Reverend friend will excuse the comparison,) attended us at our inn, and with a triumphant air of lively simplicity called out, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll make Dr. Johnson a convert.&rsquo; Dr. Johnson, at his desire, read aloud some of Chatterton&rsquo;s fabricated verses, while Catcot stood at the back of his chair, moving himself like a pendulum, and beating time with his feet, and now and then looking into Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s face, wondering that he was not yet convinced. We called on Mr. Barret, the surgeon, and saw some of the <span class="t8">originals</span> as they were called, which were executed very artificially; but from a careful inspection of them, and a consideration of the circumstances with which they were attended, we were quite satisfied of the imposture, which, indeed, has been clearly demonstrated from internal evidence, by several able criticks.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Honest Catcot seemed to pay no attention whatever to any objections, but insisted, as an end of all controversy, that we should go with him to the tower of the church of St. Mary, Redcliff, and <span class="t8">view with our own eyes</span> the ancient chest in which the manuscripts were found. To this, Dr. Johnson good-naturedly agreed; and though troubled with a shortness of breathing, laboured up a long flight of steps, till we came to the place where the wonderous chest stood. &lsquo;<span class="t8">There</span>, (said Catcot, with a bouncing confident credulity,) <span class="t8">there</span> is the very chest itself.&rsquo; &lsquo;After this <span class="t8">ocular demonstration</span>, there was no more to be said. He brought to my recollection a Scotch Highlander, a man of learning too, and who had seen the world, attesting, and at the same time giving his reasons for the authenticity of Fingal:&mdash; &lsquo;I have heard all that poem when I was young.&rsquo;&mdash; &lsquo;Have you, Sir? Pray what have you heard?&rsquo;&mdash; &lsquo;I have heard Ossian, Oscar, and <span class="t8">every one of them</span>.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson said of Chatterton, &lsquo;This is the most extraordinary young man that has encountered my knowledge. It is wonderful how the whelp has written such things.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">We were by no means pleased with our inn at Bristol. &lsquo;Let us see now, (said I,) how we should describe it.&rsquo; Johnson was ready with his raillery. &lsquo;Describe it, Sir? &mdash; Why, it was so bad that Boswell wished to be in Scotland!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">After Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s return to London, I was several times with him at his house, where I occasionally slept, in the room that had been assigned to me. I dined with him at Dr. Taylor&rsquo;s, at General Oglethorpe&rsquo;s, and at General Paoli&rsquo;s. To avoid a tedious minuteness, I shall group together what I have preserved of his conversation during this period also, without specifying each scene where it passed, except one, which will be found so remarkable as certainly to deserve a very particular relation. Where the place or the persons do not contribute to the zest of the conversation, it is unnecessary to encumber my page with mentioning them. To know of what vintage our wine is, enables us to judge of its value, and to drink it with more relish: but to have the produce of each vine of one vineyard, in the same year, kept separate, would serve no purpose. To know that our wine, (to use an advertising phrase,) is &lsquo;of the stock of an Ambassadour lately deceased,&rsquo; heightens its flavour: but it signifies nothing to know the bin where each bottle was once deposited.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Garrick (he observed,) does not play the part of Archer in <span class="t8">The Beaux Stratagem</span> well. The gentleman should break out through the footman, which is not the case as he does it.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Where there is no education, as in savage countries, men will have the upper hand of women. Bodily strength, no doubt, contributes to this; but it would be so, exclusive of that; for it is mind that always governs. When it comes to dry understanding, man has the better.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The little volumes entitled <span class="t8">Respublicæ</span>, which are very well done, were a bookseller&rsquo;s work.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;There is much talk of the misery which we cause to the brute creation; but they are recompensed by existence. If they were not useful to man, and therefore protected by him, they would not be nearly so numerous.&rsquo; This argument is to be found in the able and benignant Hutchinson&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Moral Philosophy</span>. But the question is, whether the animals who endure such sufferings of various kinds, for the service and entertainment of man, would accept of existence upon the terms on which they have it. Madame Sévigné, who, though she had many enjoyments, felt with delicate sensibility the prevalence of misery, complains of the task of existence having been imposed upon her without her consent.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;That man is never happy for the present is so true, that all his relief from unhappiness is only forgetting himself for a little while. Life is a progress from want to want, not from enjoyment to enjoyment.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Though many men are nominally entrusted with the administration of hospitals and other publick institutions, almost all the good is done by one man, by whom the rest are driven on; owing to confidence in him, and indolence in them.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Lord Chesterfield&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Letters to his Son</span>, I think, might be made a very pretty book. Take out the immorality, and it should be put into the hands of every young gentleman. An elegant manner and easiness of behaviour are acquired gradually and imperceptibly. No man can say &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be genteel.&rdquo; There are ten genteel women for one genteel man, because they are more restrained. A man without some degree of restraint is insufferable; but we are all less restrained than women. Were a woman sitting in company to put out her legs before her as most men do, we should be tempted to kick them in.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">No man was a more attentive and nice observer of behaviour in those in whose company he happened to be, than Johnson; or, however strange it may seem to many, had a higher estimation of its refinements. Lord Eliot informs me, that one day when Johnson and he were at dinner at a gentleman&rsquo;s house in London, upon Lord Chesterfield&rsquo;s Letters being mentioned, Johnson surprized the company by this sentence: &lsquo;Every man of any education would rather be called a rascal, than accused of deficiency in <span class="t8">the graces</span>.&rsquo; Mr. Gibbon, who was present, turned to a lady who knew Johnson well, and lived much with him, and in his quaint manner, tapping his box, addressed her thus: &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you think, Madam, (looking towards Johnson,) that among <span class="t8">all</span> your acquaintance, you could find <span class="t8">one</span> exception?&rsquo; The lady smiled, and seemed to acquiesce.</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;I read (said he,) Sharpe&rsquo;s letters on Italy over again, when I was at<br/>Bath. There is a great deal of matter in them.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Mrs. Williams was angry that Thrale&rsquo;s family did not send regularly to her every time they heard from me while I was in the Hebrides. Little people are apt to be jealous: but they should not be jealous; for they ought to consider, that superiour attention will necessarily be paid to superiour fortune or rank. Two persons may have equal merit, and on that account may have an equal claim to attention; but one of them may have also fortune and rank, and so may have a double claim.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Talking of his notes on Shakspeare, he said, &lsquo;I despise those who do not see that I am right in the passage where <span class="t8">as</span> is repeated, and &ldquo;asses of great charge&rdquo; introduced. That on &ldquo;To be, or not to be,&rdquo; is disputable.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">A gentleman, whom I found sitting with him one morning, said, that in his opinion the character of an infidel was more detestable than that of a man notoriously guilty of an atrocious crime. I differed from him, because we are surer of the odiousness of the one, than of the errour of the other. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, I agree with him; for the infidel would be guilty of any crime if he were inclined to it.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Many things which are false are transmitted from book to book, and gain credit in the world. One of these is the cry against the evil of luxury. Now the truth is, that luxury produces much good. Take the luxury of buildings in London. Does it not produce real advantage in the conveniency and elegance of accommodation, and this all from the exertion of industry? People will tell you, with a melancholy face, how many builders are in gaol. It is plain they are in gaol, not for building; for rents are not fallen. &mdash; A man gives half a guinea for a dish of green peas. How much gardening does this occasion? how many labourers must the competition to have such things early in the market, keep in employment? You will hear it said, very gravely, Why was not the half-guinea, thus spent in luxury, given to the poor? To how many might it have afforded a good meal. Alas! has it not gone to the <span class="t8">industrious</span> poor, whom it is better to support than the <span class="t8">idle</span> poor? You are much surer that you are doing good when you <span class="t8">pay</span> money to those who work, as the recompence of their labour, than when you <span class="t8">give</span> money merely in charity. Suppose the ancient luxury of a dish of peacock&rsquo;s brains were to be revived, how many carcases would be left to the poor at a cheap rate: and as to the rout that is made about people who are ruined by extravagance, it is no matter to the nation that some individuals suffer. When so much general productive exertion is the consequence of luxury, the nation does not care though there are debtors in gaol; nay, they would not care though their creditors were there too.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">The uncommon vivacity of General Oglethorpe&rsquo;s mind, and variety of knowledge, having sometimes made his conversation seem too desultory, Johnson observed, &lsquo;Oglethorpe, Sir, never <span class="t8">completes</span> what he has to say.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p26">He on the same account made a similar remark on Patrick Lord Elibank:<br/>&lsquo;Sir, there is nothing <span class="t8">conclusive</span> in his talk.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">When I complained of having dined at a splendid table without hearing one sentence of conversation worthy of being remembered, he said, &lsquo;Sir, there seldom is any such conversation.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Why then meet at table?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why to eat and drink together, and to promote kindness; and, Sir, this is better done when there is no solid conversation; for when there is, people differ in opinion, and get into bad humour, or some of the company who are not capable of such conversation, are left out, and feel themselves uneasy. It was for this reason, Sir Robert Walpole said, he always talked bawdy at his table, because in that all could join.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Being irritated by hearing a gentleman ask Mr. Levett a variety of questions concerning him, when he was sitting by, he broke out, &lsquo;Sir, you have but two topicks, yourself and me. I am sick of both.&rsquo; &lsquo;A man, (said he,) should not talk of himself, nor much of any particular person. He should take care not to be made a proverb; and, therefore, should avoid having any one topick of which people can say, &ldquo;We shall hear him upon it.&rdquo;&rsquo; There was a Dr. Oldfield, who was always talking of the Duke of Marlborough. He came into a coffee-house one day, and told that his Grace had spoken in the House of Lords for half an hour. &lsquo;Did he indeed speak for half an hour?&rsquo; (said Belchier, the surgeon,)&mdash; &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;&mdash; &lsquo;And what did he say of Dr. Oldfield?&rsquo;&mdash; &lsquo;Nothing.&rsquo;&mdash; &lsquo;Why then, Sir, he was very ungrateful; for Dr. Oldfield could not have spoken for a quarter of an hour, without saying something of him.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Every man is to take existence on the terms on which it is given to him. To some men it is given on condition of not taking liberties, which other men may take without much harm. One may drink wine, and be nothing the worse for it; on another, wine may have effects so inflammatory as to injure him both in body and mind, and perhaps, make him commit something for which he may deserve to be hanged.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Lord Hailes&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Annals of Scotland</span> have not that painted form which is the taste of this age; but it is a book which will always sell, it has such a stability of dates, such a certainty of facts, and such a punctuality of citation. I never before read Scotch history with certainty.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I asked him whether he would advise me to read the Bible with a commentary, and what commentaries he would recommend. JOHNSON. &lsquo;To be sure, Sir, I would have you read the Bible with a commentary; and I would recommend Lowth and Patrick on the Old Testament, and Hammond on the New.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">During my stay in London this spring, I solicited his attention to another law case, in which I was engaged. In the course of a contested election for the Borough of Dumfermline, which I attended as one of my friend Colonel (afterwards Sir Archibald) Campbell&rsquo;s counsel; one of his political agents, who was charged with having been unfaithful to his employer, and having deserted to the opposite party for a pecuniary reward &mdash; attacked very rudely in a news-paper the Reverend Mr. James Thomson, one of the ministers of that place, on account of a supposed allusion to him in one of his sermons. Upon this the minister, on a subsequent Sunday, arraigned him by name from the pulpit with some severity; and the agent, after the sermon was over, rose up and asked the minister aloud, &lsquo;What bribe he had received for telling so many lies from the chair of verity.&rsquo; I was present at this very extraordinary scene. The person arraigned, and his father and brother, who had also had a share both of the reproof from the pulpit, and in the retaliation, brought an action against Mr. Thomson, in the Court of Session, for defamation and damages, and I was one of the counsel for the reverend defendant. The <span class="t8">Liberty of the Pulpit</span> was our great ground of defence; but we argued also on the provocation of the previous attack, and on the instant retaliation. The Court of Session, however &mdash; the fifteen Judges, who are at the same time the Jury, decided against the minister, contrary to my humble opinion; and several of them expressed themselves with indignation against him. He was an aged gentleman, formerly a military chaplain, and a man of high spirit and honour. Johnson was satisfied that the judgement was wrong, and dictated to me the following argument in confutation of it:</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Of the censure pronounced from the pulpit, our determination must be formed, as in other cases, by a consideration of the action itself, and the particular circumstances with which it is invested.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The right of censure and rebuke seems necessarily appendant to the pastoral office. He, to whom the care of a congregation is entrusted, is considered as the shepherd of a flock, as the teacher of a school, as the father of a family. As a shepherd tending not his own sheep but those of his master, he is answerable for those that stray, and that lose themselves by straying. But no man can be answerable for losses which he has not power to prevent, or for vagrancy which he has not authority to restrain.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;As a teacher giving instruction for wages, and liable to reproach, if those whom he undertakes to inform make no proficiency, he must have the power of enforcing attendance, of awakening negligence, and repressing contradiction.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;As a father, he possesses the paternal authority of admonition, rebuke, and punishment. He cannot, without reducing his office to an empty name, be hindered from the exercise of any practice necessary to stimulate the idle, to reform the vicious, to check the petulant, and correct the stubborn.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;If we enquire into the practice of the primitive church, we shall, I believe, find the ministers of the word exercising the whole authority of this complicated character. We shall find them not only encouraging the good by exhortation, but terrifying the wicked by reproof and denunciation. In the earliest ages of the Church, while religion was yet pure from secular advantages, the punishment of sinners was publick censure, and open penance; penalties inflicted merely by ecclesiastical authority, at a time while the church had yet no help from the civil power; while the hand of the magistrate lifted only the rod of persecution; and when governours were ready to afford a refuge to all those who fled from clerical authority.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;That the Church, therefore, had once a power of publick censure is evident, because that power was frequently exercised. That it borrowed not its power from the civil authority, is likewise certain, because civil authority was at that time its enemy.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The hour came at length, when after three hundred years of struggle and distress, Truth took possession of imperial power, and the civil laws lent their aid to the ecclesiastical constitutions. The magistrate from that time co-operated with the priest, and clerical sentences were made efficacious by secular force. But the State, when it came to the assistance of the church, had no intention to diminish its authority. Those rebukes and those censures which were lawful before, were lawful still. But they had hitherto operated only upon voluntary submission. The refractory and contemptuous were at first in no danger of temporal severities, except what they might suffer from the reproaches of conscience, or the detestation of their fellow Christians. When religion obtained the support of law, if admonitions and censures had no effect, they were seconded by the magistrates with coercion and punishment.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;It therefore appears from ecclesiastical history, that the right of inflicting shame by publick censure, has been always considered as inherent in the Church; and that this right was not conferred by the civil power; for it was exercised when the civil power operated against it. By the civil power it was never taken away; for the Christian magistrate interposed his office, not to rescue sinners from censure, but to supply more powerful means of reformation; to add pain where shame was insufficient; and when men were proclaimed unworthy of the society of the faithful, to restrain them by imprisonment, from spreading abroad the contagion of wickedness.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;It is not improbable that from this acknowledged power of publick censure, grew in time the practice of auricular confession. Those who dreaded the blast of publick reprehension, were willing to submit themselves to the priest, by a private accusation of themselves; and to obtain a reconciliation with the Church by a kind of clandestine absolution and invisible penance; conditions with which the priest would in times of ignorance and corruption, easily comply, as they increased his influence, by adding the knowledge of secret sins to that of notorious offences, and enlarged his authority, by making him the sole arbiter of the terms of reconcilement.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;From this bondage the Reformation set us free. The minister has no longer power to press into the retirements of conscience, to torture us by interrogatories, or put himself in possession of our secrets and our lives. But though we have thus controlled his usurpations, his just and original power remains unimpaired. He may still see, though he may not pry: he may yet hear, though he may not question. And that knowledge which his eyes and ears force upon him it is still his duty to use, for the benefit of his flock. A father who lives near a wicked neighbour, may forbid a son to frequent his company. A minister who has in his congregation a man of open and scandalous wickedness, may warn his parishioners to shun his conversation. To warn them is not only lawful, but not to warn them would be criminal. He may warn them one by one in friendly converse, or by a parochial visitation. But if he may warn each man singly, what shall forbid him to warn them altogether? Of that which is to be made known to all, how is there any difference whether it be communicated to each singly, or to all together? What is known to all, must necessarily be publick. Whether it shall be publick at once, or publick by degrees, is the only question. And of a sudden and solemn publication the impression is deeper, and the warning more effectual.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;It may easily be urged, if a minister be thus left at liberty to delate sinners from the pulpit, and to publish at will the crimes of a parishioner, he may often blast the innocent, and distress the timorous. He may be suspicious, and condemn without evidence; he may be rash, and judge without examination; he may be severe, and treat slight offences with too much harshness; he may be malignant and partial, and gratify his private interest or resentment under the shelter of his pastoral character.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Of all this there is possibility, and of all this there is danger. But if possibility of evil be to exclude good, no good ever can be done. If nothing is to be attempted in which there is danger, we must all sink into hopeless inactivity. The evils that may be feared from this practice arise not from any defect in the institution, but from the infirmities of human nature. Power, in whatever hands it is placed, will be sometimes improperly exerted; yet courts of law must judge, though they will sometimes judge amiss. A father must instruct his children, though he himself may often want instruction. A minister must censure sinners, though his censure may be sometimes erroneous by want of judgement, and sometimes unjust by want of honesty.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;If we examine the circumstances of the present case, we shall find the sentence neither erroneous nor unjust; we shall find no breach of private confidence, no intrusion into secret transactions. The fact was notorious and indubitable; so easy to be proved, that no proof was desired. The act was base and treacherous, the perpetration insolent and open, and the example naturally mischievous. The minister, however, being retired and recluse, had not yet heard what was publickly known throughout the parish; and on occasion of a publick election, warned his people, according to his duty, against the crimes which publick elections frequently produce. His warning was felt by one of his parishioners, as pointed particularly at himself. But instead of producing, as might be wished, private compunction and immediate reformation, it kindled only rage and resentment. He charged his minister, in a publick paper, with scandal, defamation, and falsehood. The minister, thus reproached, had his own character to vindicate, upon which his pastoral authority must necessarily depend. To be charged with a defamatory lie is an injury which no man patiently endures in common life. To be charged with polluting the pastoral office with scandal and falsehood, was a violation of character still more atrocious, as it affected not only his personal but his clerical veracity. His indignation naturally rose in proportion to his honesty, and with all the fortitude of injured honesty, he dared this calumniator in the church, and at once exonerated himself from censure, and rescued his flock from deception and from danger. The man whom he accuses pretends not to be innocent; or at least only pretends; for he declines a trial. The crime of which he is accused has frequent opportunities and strong temptations. It has already spread far, with much depravation of private morals, and much injury to publick happiness. To warn the people, therefore, against it was not wanton and officious, but necessary and pastoral.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;What then is the fault with which this worthy minister is charged? He has usurped no dominion over conscience. He has exerted no authority in support of doubtful and controverted opinions. He has not dragged into light a bashful and corrigible sinner. His censure was directed against a breach of morality, against an act which no man justifies. The man who appropriated this censure to himself, is evidently and notoriously guilty. His consciousness of his own wickedness incited him to attack his faithful reprover with open insolence and printed accusations. Such an attack made defence necessary; and we hope it will be at last decided that the means of defence were just and lawful.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p26">When I read this to Mr. Burke, he was highly pleased, and exclaimed,<br/>&lsquo;Well; he does his work in a workman-like manner.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Mr. Thomson wished to bring the cause by appeal before the House of Lords, but was dissuaded by the advice of the noble person who lately presided so ably in that Most Honourable House, and who was then Attorney-General. As my readers will no doubt be glad also to read the opinion of this eminent man upon the same subject, I shall here insert it.</p>
<p class="p24">CASE. &lsquo;There is herewith laid before you, 1. Petition for the Reverend Mr. James Thomson, minister of Dumfermline. 2. Answers thereto. 3. Copy of the judgement of the Court of Session upon both. 4. Notes of the opinions of the Judges, being the reasons upon which their decree is grounded. &lsquo;These papers you will please to peruse, and give your opinion, Whether there is a probability of the above decree of the Court of Session&rsquo;s being reversed, if Mr. Thomson should appeal from the same?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think the appeal adviseable: not only because the value of the judgement is in no degree adequate to the expence; but because there are many chances, that upon the general complexion of the case, the impression will be taken to the disadvantage of the appellant.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;It is impossible to approve the style of that sermon. But the <span class="t8">complaint</span> was not less ungracious from that man, who had behaved so ill by his original libel, and, at the time, when he received the reproach he complains of. In the last article, all the plaintiffs are equally concerned. It struck me also with some wonder, that the Judges should think so much fervour apposite to the occasion of reproving the defendant for a little excess.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Upon the matter, however, I agree with them in condemning the behaviour of the minister; and in thinking it a subject fit for ecclesiastical censure; and even for an action, if any individual could qualify a wrong, and a damage arising from it. But this I doubt. The circumstance of publishing the reproach in a pulpit, though extremely indecent, and culpable in another view, does not constitute a different sort of wrong, or any other rule of law, than would have obtained, if the same words had been pronounced elsewhere. I don&rsquo;t know whether there be any difference in the law of Scotland, in the definition of slander, before the Commissaries, or the Court of Session. The common law of England does not give way to actions for every reproachful word. An action cannot be brought for general damages, upon any words which import less than an offence cognisable by law; consequently no action could have been brought here for the words in question. Both laws admit the truth to be a justification in action <span class="t8">for words</span>; and the law of England does the same in actions for libels. The judgement, therefore, seems to me to have been wrong, in that the Court repelled that defence.</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">&lsquo;E. THURLOW.&rsquo;</span></p>
<p class="p21">I am now to record a very curious incident in Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s Life, which fell under my own observation; of which <span class="t8">pars magna fui</span>, and which I am persuaded will, with the liberal-minded, be much to his credit.</p>
<p class="p24">My desire of being acquainted with celebrated men of every description, had made me, much about the same time, obtain an introduction to Dr. Samuel Johnson and to John Wilkes, Esq. Two men more different could perhaps not be selected out of all mankind. They had even attacked one another with some asperity in their writings; yet I lived in habits of friendship with both. I could fully relish the excellence of each; for I have ever delighted in that intellectual chymistry, which can separate good qualities from evil in the same person.</p>
<p class="p24">Sir John Pringle, &lsquo;mine own friend and my Father&rsquo;s friend,&rsquo; between whom and Dr. Johnson I in vain wished to establish an acquaintance, as I respected and lived in intimacy with both of them, observed to me once, very ingeniously, &lsquo;It is not in friendship as in mathematicks, where two things, each equal to a third, are equal between themselves. You agree with Johnson as a middle quality, and you agree with me as a middle quality; but Johnson and I should not agree.&rsquo; Sir John was not sufficiently flexible; so I desisted; knowing, indeed, that the repulsion was equally strong on the part of Johnson; who, I know not from what cause, unless his being a Scotchman, had formed a very erroneous opinion of Sir John. But I conceived an irresistible wish, if possible, to bring Dr. Johnson and Mr. Wilkes together. How to manage it, was a nice and difficult matter.</p>
<p class="p24">My worthy booksellers and friends, Messieurs Dilly in the Poultry, at whose hospitable and well-covered table I have seen a greater number of literary men, than at any other, except that of Sir Joshua Reynolds, had invited me to meet Mr. Wilkes and some more gentlemen on Wednesday, May 15. &lsquo;Pray (said I,) let us have Dr. Johnson.&rsquo;&mdash; &lsquo;What with Mr. Wilkes? not for the world, (said Mr. Edward Dilly:) Dr. Johnson would never forgive me.&rsquo;&mdash; &lsquo;Come, (said I,) if you&rsquo;ll let me negociate for you, I will be answerable that all shall go well.&rsquo; DILLY. &lsquo;Nay, if you will take it upon you, I am sure I shall be very happy to see them both here.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Notwithstanding the high veneration which I entertained for Dr. Johnson, I was sensible that he was sometimes a little actuated by the spirit of contradiction, and by means of that I hoped I should gain my point. I was persuaded that if I had come upon him with a direct proposal, &lsquo;Sir, will you dine in company with Jack Wilkes?&rsquo; he would have flown into a passion, and would probably have answered, &lsquo;Dine with Jack Wilkes, Sir! I&rsquo;d as soon dine with Jack Ketch.&rsquo; I therefore, while we were sitting quietly, by ourselves at his house in an evening, took occasion to open my plan thus:&mdash; &lsquo;Mr. Dilly, Sir, sends his respectful compliments to you, and would be happy if you would do him the honour to dine with him on Wednesday next along with me, as I must soon go to Scotland.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, I am obliged to Mr. Dilly. I will wait upon him&mdash; &lsquo;BOSWELL. &lsquo;Provided, Sir, I suppose, that the company which he is to have, is agreeable to you.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;What do you mean, Sir? What do you take me for? Do you think I am so ignorant of the world, as to imagine that I am to prescribe to a gentleman what company he is to have at his table?&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;I beg your pardon, Sir, for wishing to prevent you from meeting people whom you might not like. Perhaps he may have some of what he calls his patriotick friends with him.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Well, Sir, and what then? What care <span class="t8">I</span> for his <span class="t8">patriotick friends</span>? Poh!&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;I should not be surprized to find Jack Wilkes there.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;And if Jack Wilkes <span class="t8">should</span> be there, what is that to <span class="t8">me</span>, Sir? My dear friend, let us have no more of this. I am sorry to be angry with you; but really it is treating me strangely to talk to me as if I could not meet any company whatever, occasionally.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Pray forgive me, Sir: I meant well. But you shall meet whoever comes, for me.&rsquo; Thus I secured him, and told Dilly that he would find him very well pleased to be one of his guests on the day appointed.</p>
<p class="p24">Upon the much-expected Wednesday, I called on him about half an hour before dinner, as I often did when we were to dine out together, to see that he was ready in time, and to accompany him. I found him buffeting his books, as upon a former occasion, covered with dust, and making no preparation for going abroad. &lsquo;How is this, Sir? (said I.) Don&rsquo;t you recollect that you are to dine at Mr. Dilly&rsquo;s?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, I did not think of going to Dilly&rsquo;s: it went out of my head. I have ordered dinner at home with Mrs. Williams.&rsquo; BOSWELL, &lsquo;But, my dear Sir, you know you were engaged to Mr. Dilly, and I told him so. He will expect you, and will be much disappointed if you don&rsquo;t come.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;You must talk to Mrs. Williams about this.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Here was a sad dilemma. I feared that what I was so confident I had secured would yet be frustrated. He had accustomed himself to shew Mrs. Williams such a degree of humane attention, as frequently imposed some restraint upon him; and I knew that if she should be obstinate, he would not stir. I hastened down stairs to the blind lady&rsquo;s room, and told her I was in great uneasiness, for Dr. Johnson had engaged to me to dine this day at Mr. Dilly&rsquo;s, but that he had told me he had forgotten his engagement, and had ordered dinner at home. &lsquo;Yes, Sir, (said she, pretty peevishly,) Dr. Johnson is to dine at home,&rsquo;&mdash; &lsquo;Madam, (said I,) his respect for you is such, that I know he will not leave you unless you absolutely desire it. But as you have so much of his company, I hope you will be good enough to forego it for a day; as Mr. Dilly is a very worthy man, has frequently had agreeable parties at his house for Dr. Johnson, and will be vexed if the Doctor neglects him to-day. And then, Madam, be pleased to consider my situation; I carried the message, and I assured Mr. Dilly that Dr. Johnson was to come, and no doubt he has made a dinner, and invited a company, and boasted of the honour he expected to have. I shall be quite disgraced if the Doctor is not there.&rsquo; She gradually softened to my solicitations, which were certainly as earnest as most entreaties to ladies upon any occasion, and was graciously pleased to empower me to tell Dr. Johnson, &lsquo;That all things considered she thought he should certainly go.&rsquo; I flew back to him still in dust, and careless of what should be the event, &lsquo;indifferent in his choice to go or stay;&rsquo; but as soon as I had announced to him Mrs. Williams&rsquo; consent, he roared, &lsquo;Frank, a clean shirt,&rsquo; and was very soon drest. When I had him fairly seated in a hackney-coach with me, I exulted as much as a fortune-hunter who has got an heiress into a post-chaise with him to set out for Gretna-Green.</p>
<p class="p24">When we entered Mr. Dilly&rsquo;s drawing room, he found himself in the midst of a company he did not know. I kept myself snug and silent, watching how he would conduct himself. I observed him whispering to Mr. Dilly, &lsquo;Who is that gentleman, Sir?&rsquo;&mdash; &lsquo;Mr. Arthur Lee.&rsquo; &mdash; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Too, too, too,&rsquo; (under his breath,) which was one of his habitual mutterings. Mr. Arthur Lee could not but be very obnoxious to Johnson, for he was not only a <span class="t8">patriot</span> but an <span class="t8">American</span>. He was afterwards minister from the United States at the court of Madrid. &lsquo;And who is the gentleman in lace?&rsquo;&mdash; &lsquo;Mr. Wilkes, Sir.&rsquo; This information confounded him still more; he had some difficulty to restrain himself, and taking up a book, sat down upon a window-seat and read, or at least kept his eye upon it intently for some time, till he composed himself. His feelings, I dare say, were aukward enough. But he no doubt recollected his having rated me for supposing that he could be at all disconcerted by any company, and he, therefore, resolutely set himself to behave quite as an easy man of the world, who could adapt himself at once to the disposition and manners of those whom he might chance to meet.</p>
<p class="p24">The cheering sound of &lsquo;Dinner is upon the table,&rsquo; dissolved his reverie, and we <span class="t8">all</span> sat down without any symptom of ill humour. There were present, beside Mr. Wilkes, and Mr. Arthur Lee, who was an old companion of mine when he studied physick at Edinburgh, Mr. (now Sir John) Miller, Dr. Lettsom, and Mr. Slater the druggist. Mr. Wilkes placed himself next to Dr. Johnson, and behaved to him with so much attention and politeness, that he gained upon him insensibly. No man eat more heartily than Johnson, or loved better what was nice and delicate. Mr. Wilkes was very assiduous in helping him to some fine veal. &lsquo;Pray give me leave, Sir: &mdash; It is better here &mdash; A little of the brown &mdash; Some fat, Sir &mdash; A little of the stuffing &mdash; Some gravy &mdash; Let me have the pleasure of giving you some butter &mdash; Allow me to recommend a squeeze of this orange; &mdash; or the lemon, perhaps, may have more zest.&rsquo;&mdash; &lsquo;Sir, Sir, I am obliged to you, Sir,&rsquo; cried Johnson, bowing, and turning &mdash; his head to him with a look for some time of &lsquo;surly virtue,&rsquo; but, in a short while, of complacency.</p>
<p class="p24">Foote being mentioned, Johnson said. &lsquo;He is not a good mimick.&rsquo; One of the company added, &lsquo;A merry Andrew, a buffoon.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;But he has wit too, and is not deficient in ideas, or in fertility and variety of imagery, and not empty of reading; he has knowledge enough to fill up his part. One species of wit he has in an eminent degree, that of escape. You drive him into a corner with both hands; but he&rsquo;s gone, Sir, when you think you have got him &mdash; like an animal that jumps over your head. Then he has a great range for wit; he never lets truth stand between him and a jest, and he is sometimes mighty coarse. Garrick is under many restraints from which Foote is free.&rsquo; WILKES. &lsquo;Garrick&rsquo;s wit is more like Lord Chesterfield&rsquo;s.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;The first time I was in company with Foote was at Fitzherbert&rsquo;s. Having no good opinion of the fellow, I was resolved not to be pleased; and it is very difficult to please a man against his will. I went on eating my dinner pretty sullenly, affecting not to mind him. But the dog was so very comical, that I was obliged to lay down my knife and fork, throw myself back upon my chair, and fairly laugh it out. No, Sir, he was irresistible. He upon one occasion experienced, in an extraordinary degree, the efficacy of his powers of entertaining. Amongst the many and various modes which he tried of getting money, he became a partner with a small-beer brewer, and he was to have a share of the profits for procuring customers amongst his numerous acquaintance. Fitzherbert was one who took his small-beer; but it was so bad that the servants resolved not to drink it. They were at some loss how to notify their resolution, being afraid of offending their master, who they knew liked Foote much as a companion. At last they fixed upon a little black boy, who was rather a favourite, to be their deputy, and deliver their remonstrance; and having invested him with the whole authority of the kitchen, he was to inform Mr. Fitzherbert, in all their names, upon a certain day, that they would drink Foote&rsquo;s small-beer no longer. On that day Foote happened to dine at Fitzherbert&rsquo;s, and this boy served at table; he was so delighted with Foote&rsquo;s stories, and merriment, and grimace, that when he went down stairs, he told them, &ldquo;This is the finest man I have ever seen. I will not deliver your message. I will drink his small-beer.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Somebody observed that Garrick could not have done this. WILKES. &lsquo;Garrick would have made the small-beer still smaller. He is now leaving the stage; but he will play <span class="t8">Scrub</span> all his life.&rsquo; I knew that Johnson would let nobody attack Garrick but himself, as Garrick once said to me, and I had heard him praise his liberality; so to bring out his commendation of his celebrated pupil, I said, loudly, &lsquo;I have heard Garrick is liberal.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Yes, Sir, I know that Garrick has given away more money than any man in England that I am acquainted with, and that not from ostentatious views. Garrick was very poor when he began life; so when he came to have money, he probably was very unskilful in giving away, and saved when he should not. But Garrick began to be liberal as soon as he could; and I am of opinion, the reputation of avarice which he has had, has been very lucky for him, and prevented his having many enemies. You despise a man for avarice, but do not hate him. Garrick might have been much better attacked for living with more splendour than is suitable to a player: if they had had the wit to have assaulted him in that quarter, they might have galled him more. But they have kept clamouring about his avarice, which has rescued him from much obloquy and envy.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Talking of the great difficulty of obtaining authentick information for biography, Johnson told us, &lsquo;When I was a young fellow I wanted to write the <span class="t8">Life of Dryden</span>, and in order to get materials, I applied to the only two persons then alive who had seen him; these were old Swinney and old Cibber. Swinney&rsquo;s information was no more than this, &ldquo;That at Will&rsquo;s coffee-house Dryden had a particular chair for himself, which was set by the fire in winter, and was then called his winter-chair; and that it was carried out for him to the balcony in summer, and was then called his summer-chair.&rdquo; Cibber could tell no more but &ldquo;That he remembered him a decent old man, arbiter of critical disputes at Will&rsquo;s.&rdquo; You are to consider that Cibber was then at a great distance from Dryden, had perhaps one leg only in the room, and durst not draw in the other.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Yet Cibber was a man of observation?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;I think not.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;You will allow his <span class="t8">Apology</span> to be well done.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Very well done, to be sure, Sir. That book is a striking proof of the justice of Pope&rsquo;s remark:</p>
<p class="p26">&ldquo;Each might his several province well command,<br/>Would all but stoop to what they understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">BOSWELL. &lsquo;And his plays are good.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Yes; but that was his trade; <span class="t8">l&rsquo;esprit du corps</span>; he had been all his life among players and play-writers. I wondered that he had so little to say in conversation, for he had kept the best company, and learnt all that can be got by the ear. He abused Pindar to me, and then shewed me an Ode of his own, with an absurd couplet, making a linnet soar on an eagle&rsquo;s wing. I told him that when the ancients made a simile, they always made it like something real.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Mr. Wilkes remarked, that &lsquo;among all the bold flights of Shakspeare&rsquo;s imagination, the boldest was making Birnamwood march to Dunsinane; creating a wood where there never was a shrub; a wood in Scotland! ha! ha! ha!&rsquo; And he also observed, that &lsquo;the clannish slavery of the Highlands of Scotland was the single exception to Milton&rsquo;s remark of &ldquo;The Mountain Nymph, sweet Liberty,&rdquo; being worshipped in all hilly countries.&rsquo;&mdash; &lsquo;When I was at Inverary (said he,) on a visit to my old friend, Archibald, Duke of Argyle, his dependents congratulated me on being such a favourite of his Grace. I said, &ldquo;It is then, gentlemen, truely lucky for me; for if I had displeased the Duke, and he had wished it, there is not a Campbell among you but would have been ready to bring John Wilkes&rsquo;s head to him in a charger. It would have been only</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;&ldquo;&lsquo;Off with his head! So much for Aylesbury.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I was then member for Aylesbury.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Dr. Johnson and Mr. Wilkes talked of the contested passage in Horace&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Art of Poetry</span>, &lsquo;<span class="t8">Difficile est propriè communia dicere</span>.&rsquo; Mr. Wilkes according to my note, gave the interpretation thus; &lsquo;It is difficult to speak with propriety of common things; as, if a poet had to speak of Queen Caroline drinking tea, he must endeavour to avoid the vulgarity of cups and saucers.&rsquo; But upon reading my note, he tells me that he meant to say, that &lsquo;the word <span class="t8">communia</span>, being a Roman law term, signifies here things <span class="t8">communis juris</span>, that is to say, what have never yet been treated by any body; and this appears clearly from what followed,</p>
<p class="p26">&ldquo; &mdash; Tuque<br/>Rectiùs Iliacum carmen deducis in actus<br/>Quàm si proferres ignota indictaque primus.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;You will easier make a tragedy out of the <span class="t8">Iliad</span> than on any subject not handled before.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;He means that it is difficult to appropriate to particular persons qualities which are common to all mankind, as Homer has done.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">WILKES. &lsquo;We have no City-Poet now: that is an office which has gone into disuse. The last was Elkanah Settle. There is something in <span class="t8">names</span> which one cannot help feeling. Now <span class="t8">Elkanah Settle</span> sounds so <span class="t8">queer</span>, who can expect much from that name? We should have no hesitation to give it for John Dryden, in preference to Elkanah Settle, from the names only, without knowing their different merits.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;I suppose, Sir, Settle did as well for Aldermen in his time, as John Home could do now. Where did Beckford and Trecothick learn English?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Mr. Arthur Lee mentioned some Scotch who had taken possession of a barren part of America, and wondered why they should choose it. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, all barrenness is comparative. The <span class="t8">Scotch</span> would not know it to be barren.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Come, come, he is flattering the English. You have now been in Scotland, Sir, and say if you did not see meat and drink enough there.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why yes, Sir; meat and drink enough to give the inhabitants sufficient strength to run away from home.&rsquo; All these quick and lively sallies were said sportively, quite in jest, and with a smile, which showed that he meant only wit. Upon this topick he and Mr. Wilkes could perfectly assimilate; here was a bond of union between them, and I was conscious that as both of them had visited Caledonia, both were fully satisfied of the strange narrow ignorance of those who imagine that it is a land of famine. But they amused themselves with persevering in the old jokes. When I claimed a superiority for Scotland over England in one respect, that no man can be arrested there for a debt merely because another swears it against him; but there must first be the judgement of a court of law ascertaining its justice; and that a seizure of the person, before judgement is obtained, can take place only, if his creditor should swear that he is about to fly from the country, or, as it is technically expressed, is <span class="t8">in meditatione fugae</span>: WILKES. &lsquo;That, I should think, may be safely sworn of all the Scotch nation.&rsquo; JOHNSON. (to Mr. Wilkes) &lsquo;You must know, Sir, I lately took my friend Boswell and shewed him genuine civilised life in an English provincial town. I turned him loose at Lichfield, my native city, that he might see for once real civility: for you know he lives among savages in Scotland, and among rakes in London.&rsquo; WILKES. &lsquo;Except when he is with grave, sober, decent people like you and me.&rsquo; JOHNSON, (smiling) &lsquo;And we ashamed of him.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">They were quite frank and easy. Johnson told the story of his asking Mrs. Macaulay to allow her footman to sit down with them, to prove the ridiculousness of the argument for the equality of mankind; and he said to me afterwards, with a nod of satisfaction, &lsquo;You saw Mr. Wilkes acquiesced.&rsquo; Wilkes talked with all imaginable freedom of the ludicrous title given to the Attorney-General, <span class="t8">Diabolus Regis</span>; adding, &lsquo;I have reason to know something about that officer; for I was prosecuted for a libel.&rsquo; Johnson, who many people would have supposed must have been furiously angry at hearing this talked of so lightly, said not a word. He was now, <span class="t8">indeed</span>, &lsquo;a good-humoured fellow.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">After dinner we had an accession of Mrs. Knowles, the Quaker lady, well known for her various talents, and of Mr. Alderman Lee. Amidst some patriotick groans, somebody (I think the Alderman) said, &lsquo;Poor old England is lost.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, it is not so much to be lamented that Old England is lost, as that the Scotch have found it.&rsquo; WILKES. &lsquo;Had Lord Bute governed Scotland only, I should not have taken the trouble to write his eulogy, and dedicate <span class="t8">Mortimer</span> to him.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Mr. Wilkes held a candle to shew a fine print of a beautiful female figure which hung in the room, and pointed out the elegant contour of the bosom with the finger of an arch connoisseur. He afterwards, in a conversation with me, waggishly insisted, that all the time Johnson shewed visible signs of a fervent admiration of the corresponding charms of the fair Quaker.</p>
<p class="p24">This record, though by no means so perfect as I could wish, will serve to give a notion of a very curious interview, which was not only pleasing at the time, but had the agreeable and benignant effect of reconciling any animosity, and sweetening any acidity, which in the various bustle of political contest, had been produced in the minds of two men, who though widely different, had so many things in common &mdash; classical learning, modern literature, wit, and humour, and ready repartee &mdash; that it would have been much to be regretted if they had been for ever at a distance from each other.</p>
<p class="p24">Mr. Burke gave me much credit for this successful <span class="t8">negociation</span>; and pleasantly said, that &lsquo;there was nothing to equal it in the whole history of the <span class="t8">Corps Diplomatique</span>&rsquo;.</p>
<p class="p24">I attended Dr. Johnson home, and had the satisfaction to hear him tell Mrs. Williams how much he had been pleased with Mr. Wilkes&rsquo;s company, and what an agreeable day he had passed.</p>
<p class="p24">I talked a good deal to him of the celebrated Margaret Caroline Rudd, whom I had visited, induced by the fame of her talents, address, and irresistible power of fascination. To a lady who disapproved of my visiting her, he said on a former occasion, &lsquo;Nay, Madam, Boswell is in the right; I should have visited her myself, were it not that they have now a trick of putting every thing into the news-papers.&rsquo; This evening he exclaimed, &lsquo;I envy him his acquaintance with Mrs. Rudd.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I mentioned a scheme which I had of making a tour to the Isle of Man, and giving a full account of it; and that Mr. Burke had playfully suggested as a motto,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The proper study of mankind is MAN.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, you will get more by the book than the jaunt will cost you; so you will have your diversion for nothing, and add to your reputation.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On the evening of the next day I took leave of him, being to set out for Scotland. I thanked him with great warmth for all his kindness. &lsquo;Sir, (said he,) you are very welcome. Nobody repays it with more.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">How very false is the notion which has gone round the world of the rough, and passionate, and harsh manners of this great and good man. That he had occasional sallies of heat of temper, and that he was sometimes, perhaps, too &lsquo;easily provoked&rsquo; by absurdity and folly, and sometimes too desirous of triumph in colloquial contest, must be allowed. The quickness both of his perception and sensibility disposed him to sudden explosions of satire; to which his extraordinary readiness of wit was a strong and almost irresistible incitement. To adopt one of the finest images in Mr. Home&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Douglas</span>,</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;On each glance of thought<br/>Decision followed, as the thunderbolt<br/>Pursues the flash!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I admit that the beadle within him was often so eager to apply the lash, that the Judge had not time to consider the case with sufficient deliberation.</p>
<p class="p24">That he was occasionally remarkable for violence of temper may be granted: but let us ascertain the degree, and not let it be supposed that he was in a perpetual rage, and never without a club in his hand, to knock down every one who approached him. On the contrary, the truth is, that by much the greatest part of his time he was civil, obliging, nay, polite in the true sense of the word; so much so, that many gentlemen, who were long acquainted with him, never received, or even heard a strong expression from him.</p>
<p class="p24">The following letters concerning an Epitaph which he wrote for the monument of Dr. Goldsmith, in Westminster-Abbey, afford at once a proof of his unaffected modesty, his carelessness as to his own writings, and of the great respect which he entertained for the taste and judgement of the excellent and eminent person to whom they are addressed:</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">&lsquo;TO SIR JOSHUA REYNOLDS.</span></p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I have been kept away from you, I know not well how, and of these vexatious hindrances I know not when there will be an end. I therefore send you the poor dear Doctor&rsquo;s epitaph. Read it first yourself; and if you then think it right, shew it to the Club. I am, you know, willing to be corrected. If you think any thing much amiss, keep it to yourself, till we come together. I have sent two copies, but prefer the card. The dates must be settled by Dr. Percy.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am, Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your most humble servant,</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;May 16, 1776.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">TO THE SAME.</span></p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Miss Reynolds has a mind to send the Epitaph to Dr. Beattie; I am very willing, but having no copy, cannot immediately recollect it. She tells me you have lost it. Try to recollect and put down as much as you retain; you perhaps may have kept what I have dropped. The lines for which I am at a loss are something of <span class="t8">rerum civilium sivè naturalium</span>.&rsquo; It was a sorry trick to lose it; help me if you can. I am, Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your most humble servant,</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;June 22, 1776.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The gout grows better but slowly.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">It was, I think, after I had left London this year, that this Epitaph gave occasion to a <span class="t8">Remonstrance</span> to the MONARCH OF LITERATURE, for an account of which I am indebted to Sir William Forbes, of Pitsligo.</p>
<p class="p26">That my readers may have the subject more fully and clearly before them,<br/>I shall first insert the Epitaph.</p>
<p class="p26">OLIVARII GOLDSMITH,<br/>Poetae, Physici, Historici,<br/>Qui nullum ferè scribendi genus<br/>Non tetigit,<br/>Nullum quod tetigit non ornavit.<br/>Sive risus essent movendi,<br/>Sive lacrymae,<br/>Affectuum potens at lenis dominator:<br/>Ingenio sublimis, vividus, versatilis,<br/>Oratione grandis, nitidus, venustus:<br/>Hoc monumento memoriam coluit<br/>Sodalium amor,<br/>Amicorum fides,<br/>Lectorum veneratio.<br/>Natus in Hiberniâ Forniae Longfordiensis,<br/>In loco cui nomen Pallas,<br/>Nov. XXIX. MDCCXXXI;<br/>Eblanae literis institutus;<br/>Obiit Londini,<br/>April IV, MDCCLXXIV.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Sir William Forbes writes to me thus: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I enclose the <span class="t8">Round Robin</span>. This <span class="t8">jeu d&rsquo;esprit</span> took its rise one day at dinner at our friend Sir Joshua Reynolds&rsquo;s. All the company present, except myself, were friends and acquaintance of Dr. Goldsmith. The Epitaph, written for him by Dr. Johnson, became the subject of conversation, and various emendations were suggested, which it was agreed should be submitted to the Doctor&rsquo;s consideration. But the question was, who should have the courage to propose them to him? At last it was hinted, that there could be no way so good as that of a <span class="t8">Round Robin</span>, as the sailors call it, which they make use of when they enter into a conspiracy, so as not to let it be known who puts his name first or last to the paper. This proposition was instantly assented to; and Dr. Barnard, Dean of Derry, now Bishop of Killaloe, drew up an address to Dr. Johnson on the occasion, replete with wit and humour, but which it was feared the Doctor might think treated the subject with too much levity. Mr. Burke then proposed the address as it stands in the paper in writing, to which I had the honour to officiate as clerk.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Sir Joshua agreed to carry it to Dr. Johnson, who received it with much good humour, and desired Sir Joshua to tell the gentlemen, that he would alter the Epitaph in any manner they pleased, as to the sense of it; but <span class="t8">he would never consent to disgrace the walls of Westminster Abbey</span> with an English inscription.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I consider this <span class="t8">Round Robin</span> as a species of literary curiosity worth preserving, as it marks, in a certain degree, Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s character.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">My readers are presented with a faithful transcript of a paper, which I doubt not of their being desirous to see.</p>
<p class="p24">Sir William Forbes&rsquo;s observation is very just. The anecdote now related proves, in the strongest manner, the reverence and awe with which Johnson was regarded, by some of the most eminent men of his time, in various departments, and even by such of them as lived most with him; while it also confirms what I have again and again inculcated, that he was by no means of that ferocious and irascible character which has been ignorantly imagined.</p>
<p class="p24">This hasty composition is also to be remarked as one of a thousand instances which evince the extraordinary promptitude of Mr. Burke; who while he is equal to the greatest things, can adorn the least; can, with equal facility, embrace the vast and complicated speculations of politicks, or the ingenious topicks of literary investigation.</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">&lsquo;DR. JOHNSON TO MRS. BOSWELL.</span></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">&lsquo;MADAM,</span></p>
<p class="p21">&lsquo;You must not think me uncivil in omitting to answer the letter with which you favoured me some time ago. I imagined it to have been written without Mr. Boswell&rsquo;s knowledge, and therefore supposed the answer to require, what I could not find, a private conveyance.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The difference with Lord Auchinleck is now over; and since young Alexander has appeared, I hope no more difficulties will arise among you; for I sincerely wish you all happy. Do not teach the young ones to dislike me, as you dislike me yourself; but let me at least have Veronica&rsquo;s kindness, because she is my acquaintance.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;You will now have Mr. Boswell home; it is well that you have him; he has led a wild life. I have taken him to Lichfield, and he has followed Mr. Thrale to Bath. Pray take care of him, and tame him. The only thing in which I have the honour to agree with you is, in loving him; and while we are so much of a mind in a matter of so much importance, our other quarrels will, I hope, produce no great bitterness. I am, Madam,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your most humble servant,</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;May 16, 1776.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">&lsquo;MR. BOSWELL TO DR. JOHNSON.</span></p>
<p class="p21">&lsquo;Edinburgh, June 25, 1776.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;You have formerly complained that my letters were too long. There is no danger of that complaint being made at present; for I find it difficult for me to write to you at all. [Here an account of having been afflicted with a return of melancholy or bad spirits.]</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The boxes of books which you sent to me are arrived; but I have not yet examined the contents.</p>
<p class="p10">* * * * *</p>
<p class="p21">&lsquo;I send you Mr. Maclaurin&rsquo;s paper for the negro, who claims his freedom in the Court of Session.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">&lsquo;DR. JOHNSON TO MR. BOSWELL.</span></p>
<p class="p21">&lsquo;Dear Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;These black fits, of which you complain, perhaps hurt your memory as well as your imagination. When did I complain that your letters were too long? Your last letter, after a very long delay, brought very bad news. [Here a series of reflections upon melancholy, and &mdash; what I could not help thinking strangely unreasonable in him who had suffered so much from it himself, &mdash; a good deal of severity and reproof, as if it were owing to my own fault, or that I was, perhaps, affecting it from a desire of distinction.]</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Read Cheyne&rsquo;s <span class="t8">English Malady</span>; but do not let him teach you a foolish notion that melancholy is a proof of acuteness.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To hear that you have not opened your boxes of books is very offensive. The examination and arrangement of so many volumes might have afforded you an amusement very seasonable at present, and useful for the whole of life. I am, I confess, very angry that you manage yourself so ill.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I do not now say any more, than that I am, with great kindness, and sincerity, dear Sir,</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;Your humble servant,<br/>&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;<br/>&lsquo;July 2, 1776.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;It was last year determined by Lord Mansfield, in the Court of King&rsquo;s Bench, that a negro cannot be taken out of the kingdom without his own consent.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">&lsquo;DR. JOHNSON TO MR. BOSWELL.</span></p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I make haste to write again, lest my last letter should give you too much pain. If you are really oppressed with overpowering and involuntary melancholy, you are to be pitied rather than reproached.</p>
<p class="p10">* * * * *</p>
<p class="p21">&lsquo;Now, my dear Bozzy, let us have done with quarrels and with censure. Let me know whether I have not sent you a pretty library. There are, perhaps, many books among them which you never need read through; but there are none which it is not proper for you to know, and sometimes to consult. Of these books, of which the use is only occasional, it is often sufficient to know the contents, that, when any question arises, you may know where to look for information.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Since I wrote, I have looked over Mr. Maclaurin&rsquo;s plea, and think it excellent. How is the suit carried on? If by subscription, I commission you to contribute, in my name, what is proper. Let nothing be wanting in such a case. Dr. Drummond, I see, is superseded. His father would have grieved; but he lived to obtain the pleasure of his son&rsquo;s election, and died before that pleasure was abated.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Langton&rsquo;s lady has brought him a girl, and both are well; I dined with him the other day.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;It vexes me to tell you, that on the evening of the 29th of May I was seized by the gout, and am not quite well. The pain has not been violent, but the weakness and tenderness were very troublesome, and what is said to be very uncommon, it has not alleviated my other disorders. Make use of youth and health while you have them; make my compliments to Mrs. Boswell. I am, my dear Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your most affectionate</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;July 6, 1776.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Mr. BOSWELL TO DR. JOHNSON.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Edinburgh, July 18, 1776.</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">&lsquo;MY DEAR SIR,</span></p>
<p class="p21">&lsquo;Your letter of the second of this month was rather a harsh medicine; but I was delighted with that spontaneous tenderness, which, a few days afterwards, sent forth such balsam as your next brought me. I found myself for some time so ill that all I could do was to preserve a decent appearance, while all within was weakness and distress. Like a reduced garrison that has some spirit left, I hung out flags, and planted all the force I could muster, upon the walls. I am now much better, and I sincerely thank you for your kind attention and friendly counsel.</p>
<p class="p10">* * * * *</p>
<p class="p21">&lsquo;Count Manucci came here last week from travelling in Ireland. I have shewn him what civilities I could on his own account, on yours, and on that of Mr. and Mrs. Thrale. He has had a fall from his horse, and been much hurt. I regret this unlucky accident, for he seems to be a very amiable man.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p26">As the evidence of what I have mentioned at the beginning of this year,<br/>I select from his private register the following passage:</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;July 25, 1776. O GOD, who hast ordained that whatever is to be desired should be sought by labour, and who, by thy blessing, bringest honest labour to good effect, look with mercy upon my studies and endeavours. Grant me, O LORD, to design only what is lawful and right; and afford me calmness of mind, and steadiness of purpose, that I may so do thy will in this short life, as to obtain happiness in the world to come, for the sake of JESUS CHRIST our Lord. Amen.</p>
<p class="p24">It appears from a note subjoined, that this was composed when he &lsquo;purposed to apply vigorously to study, particularly of the Greek and Italian tongues.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Such a purpose, so expressed, at the age of sixty-seven, is admirable and encouraging; and it must impress all the thinking part of my readers with a consolatory confidence in habitual devotion, when they see a man of such enlarged intellectual powers as Johnson, thus in the genuine earnestness of secrecy, imploring the aid of that Supreme Being, &lsquo;from whom cometh down every good and every perfect gift.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">&lsquo;TO SIR JOSHUA REYNOLDS.</span></p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;A young man, whose name is Paterson, offers himself this evening to the Academy. He is the son of a man for whom I have long had a kindness, and who is now abroad in distress. I shall be glad that you will be pleased to shew him any little countenance, or pay him any small distinction. How much it is in your power to favour or to forward a young man I do not know; nor do I know how much this candidate deserves favour by his personal merit, or what hopes his proficiency may now give of future eminence. I recommend him as the son of my friend. Your character and station enable you to give a young man great encouragement by very easy means. You have heard of a man who asked no other favour of Sir Robert Walpole, than that he would bow to him at his levee.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am, Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your most humble servant,</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Aug. 3, 1776.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">&lsquo;MR. BOSWELL TO DR. JOHNSON.</span></p>
<p class="p21">&lsquo;Edinburgh, August 30, 1776.</p>
<p class="p24">[After giving him an account of my having examined the chests of books which he had sent to me, and which contained what may be truely called a numerous and miscellaneous <span class="t8">Stall Library</span>, thrown together at random: &mdash; ]</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Lord Hailes was against the decree in the case of my client, the minister; not that he justified the minister, but because the parishioner both provoked and retorted. I sent his Lordship your able argument upon the case for his perusal. His observation upon it in a letter to me was, &ldquo;Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Suasorium</span> is pleasantly and artfully composed. I suspect, however, that he has not convinced himself; for, I believe that he is better read in ecclesiastical history, than to imagine that a Bishop or a Presbyter has a right to begin censure or discipline <span class="t8">è cathedrá</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p10">* * * * *</p>
<p class="p21">&lsquo;For the honour of Count Manucci, as well as to observe that exactness of truth which you have taught me, I must correct what I said in a former letter. He did not fall from his horse, which might have been an imputation on his skill as an officer of cavalry; his horse fell with him.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I have, since I saw you, read every word of Granger&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Biographical History</span>. It has entertained me exceedingly, and I do not think him the <span class="t8">Whig</span> that you supposed. Horace Walpole&rsquo;s being his patron is, indeed, no good sign of his political principles. But he denied to Lord Mountstuart that he was a Whig, and said he had been accused by both parties of partiality. It seems he was like Pope,</p>
<p class="p24">&ldquo;While Tories call me Whig, and Whigs a Tory.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I wish you would look more into his book; and as Lord Mountstuart wishes much to find a proper person to continue the work upon Granger&rsquo;s plan, and has desired I would mention it to you; if such a man occurs, please to let me know. His Lordship will give him generous encouragement.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">&lsquo;TO MR. ROBERT LEVETT.</span></p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Having spent about six weeks at this place, we have at length resolved upon returning. I expect to see you all in Fleet-street on the 30th of this month.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I did not go into the sea till last Friday, but think to go most of this week, though I know not that it does me any good. My nights are very restless and tiresome, but I am otherwise well.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I have written word of my coming to Mrs. Williams. Remember me kindly to Francis and Betsy. I am, Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your humble servant,</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Brighthelmstone, Oct. 21, 1776&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I again wrote to Dr. Johnson on the 21st of October, informing him, that my father had, in the most liberal manner, paid a large debt for me, and that I had now the happiness of being upon very good terms with him; to which he returned the following answer.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To JAMES BOSWELL, ESQ.</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I had great pleasure in hearing that you are at last on good terms with your father. Cultivate his kindness by all honest and manly means. Life is but short; no time can be afforded but for the indulgence of real sorrow, or contests upon questions seriously momentous. Let us not throw away any of our days upon useless resentment, or contend who shall hold out longest in stubborn malignity. It is best not to be angry; and best, in the next place, to be quickly reconciled. May you and your father pass the remainder of your time in reciprocal benevolence!</p>
<p class="p10">* * * * *</p>
<p class="p21">&lsquo;Do you ever hear from Mr. Langton? I visit him sometimes, but he does not talk. I do not like his scheme of life; but as I am not permitted to understand it, I cannot set any thing right that is wrong. His children are sweet babies.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I hope my irreconcileable enemy, Mrs. Boswell, is well. Desire her not to transmit her malevolence to the young people. Let me have Alexander, and Veronica, and Euphemia, for my friends.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Mrs. Williams, whom you may reckon as one of your well-wishers, is in a feeble and languishing state, with little hope of growing better. She went for some part of the autumn into the country, but is little benefited; and Dr. Lawrence confesses that his art is at an end. Death is, however, at a distance; and what more than that can we say of ourselves? I am sorry for her pain, and more sorry for her decay. Mr. Levett is sound, wind and limb.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I was some weeks this autumn at Brighthelmstone. The place was very dull, and I was not well; the expedition to the Hebrides was the most pleasant journey that I ever made. Such an effort annually would give the world a little diversification.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Every year, however, we cannot wander, and must therefore endeavour to spend our time at home as well as we can. I believe it is best to throw life into a method, that every hour may bring its employment, and every employment have its hour. Xenophon observes, in his <span class="t8">Treatise of Oeconomy</span>, that if every thing be kept in a certain place, when any thing is worn out or consumed, the vacuity which it leaves will shew what is wanting; so if every part of time has its duty, the hour will call into remembrance its proper engagement.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I have not practised all this prudence myself, but I have suffered much for want of it; and I would have you, by timely recollection and steady resolution, escape from those evils which have lain heavy upon me. I am, my dearest Boswell,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your most humble servant,</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Bolt-court, Nov. 16, 1776.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On the 16th of November I informed him that Mr. Strahan had sent me <span class="t8">twelve</span> copies of the <span class="t8">Journey to the Western Islands</span>, handsomely bound, instead of the <span class="t8">twenty</span> copies which were stipulated; but which, I supposed, were to be only in sheets; requested to know how they should be distributed: and mentioned that I had another son born to me, who was named David, and was a sickly infant.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To JAMES BOSWELL, ESQ.</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I have been for some time ill of a cold, which, perhaps, I made an excuse to myself for not writing, when in reality I knew not what to say.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The books you must at last distribute as you think best, in my name, or your own, as you are inclined, or as you judge most proper. Every body cannot be obliged; but I wish that nobody may be offended. Do the best you can.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I congratulate you on the increase of your family, and hope that little David is by this time well, and his mamma perfectly recovered. I am much pleased to hear of the re-establishment of kindness between you and your father. Cultivate his paternal tenderness as much as you can. To live at variance at all is uncomfortable; and variance with a father is still more uncomfortable. Besides that, in the whole dispute you have the wrong side; at least you gave the first provocations, and some of them very offensive. Let it now be all over. As you have no reason to think that your new mother has shewn you any foul play, treat her with respect, and with some degree of confidence; this will secure your father. When once a discordant family has felt the pleasure of peace, they will not willingly lose it. If Mrs. Boswell would but be friends with me, we might now shut the temple of Janus.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;What came of Dr. Memis&rsquo;s cause? Is the question about the negro determined? Has Sir Allan any reasonable hopes? What is become of poor Macquarry? Let me know the event of all these litigations. I wish particularly well to the negro and Sir Allan.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Mrs. Williams has been much out of order; and though she is something better, is likely, in her physician&rsquo;s opinion, to endure her malady for life, though she may, perhaps, die of some other. Mrs. Thrale is big, and fancies that she carries a boy; if it were very reasonable to wish much about it, I should wish her not to be disappointed. The desire of male heirs is not appendant only to feudal tenures. A son is almost necessary to the continuance of Thrale&rsquo;s fortune; for what can misses do with a brewhouse? Lands are fitter for daughters than trades.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Baretti went away from Thrale&rsquo;s in some whimsical fit of disgust, or ill-nature, without taking any leave. It is well if he finds in any other place as good an habitation, and as many conveniencies. He has got five-and-twenty guineas by translating Sir Joshua&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Discourses</span> into Italian, and Mr. Thrale gave him an hundred in the spring; so that he is yet in no difficulties.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Colman has bought Foote&rsquo;s patent, and is to allow Foote for life sixteen hundred pounds a year, as Reynolds told me, and to allow him to play so often on such terms that he may gain four hundred pounds more. What Colman can get by this bargain, but trouble and hazard, I do not see. I am, dear Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your humble servant,</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Dec. 21, 1776.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">The Reverend Dr. Hugh Blair, who had long been admired as a preacher at Edinburgh, thought now of diffusing his excellent sermons more extensively, and encreasing his reputation, by publishing a collection of them. He transmitted the manuscript to Mr. Strahan, the printer, who after keeping it for some time, wrote a letter to him, discouraging the publication. Such at first was the unpropitious state of one of the most successful theological books that has ever appeared. Mr. Strahan, however, had sent one of the sermons to Dr. Johnson for his opinion; and after his unfavourable letter to Dr. Blair had been sent off, he received from Johnson on Christmas-eve, a note in which was the following paragraph:</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I have read over Dr. Blair&rsquo;s first sermon with more than approbation; to say it is good, is to say too little.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I believe Mr. Strahan had very soon after this time a conversation with Dr. Johnson concerning them; and then he very candidly wrote again to Dr. Blair, enclosing Johnson&rsquo;s note, and agreeing to purchase the volume, for which he and Mr. Cadell gave one hundred pounds. The sale was so rapid and extensive, and the approbation of the publick so high, that to their honour be it recorded, the proprietors made Dr. Blair a present first of one sum, and afterwards of another, of fifty pounds, thus voluntarily doubling the stipulated price; and when he prepared another volume, they gave him at once three hundred pounds, being in all five hundred pounds, by an agreement to which I am a subscribing witness; and now for a third octavo volume he has received no less than six hundred pounds.</p>
<p class="p24">1777: ÆTAT. 68. &mdash; In 1777, it appears from his <span class="t8">Prayers and Meditations</span>, that Johnson suffered much from a state of mind &lsquo;unsettled and perplexed,&rsquo; and from that constitutional gloom, which, together with his extreme humility and anxiety with regard to his religious state, made him contemplate himself through too dark and unfavourable a medium. It may be said of him, that he &lsquo;saw GOD in clouds.&rsquo; Certain we may be of his injustice to himself in the following lamentable paragraph, which it is painful to think came from the contrite heart of this great man, to whose labours the world is so much indebted:</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;When I survey my past life, I discover nothing but a barren waste of time, with some disorders of body, and disturbances of the mind, very near to madness, which I hope He that made me will suffer to extenuate many faults, and excuse many deficiencies.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">But we find his devotions in this year eminently fervent; and we are comforted by observing intervals of quiet, composure, and gladness.</p>
<p class="p24">On Easter-day we find the following emphatick prayer:</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Almighty and most merciful Father, who seest all our miseries, and knowest all our necessities, look down upon me, and pity me. Defend me from the violent incursion [incursions] of evil thoughts, and enable me to form and keep such resolutions as may conduce to the discharge of the duties which thy providence shall appoint me; and so help me, by thy Holy Spirit, that my heart may surely there be fixed, where true joys are to be found, and that I may serve thee with pure affection and a cheerful mind. Have mercy upon me, O GOD, have mercy upon me; years and infirmities oppress me, terrour and anxiety beset me. Have mercy upon me, my Creator and my Judge. [In all dangers protect me.] In all perplexities relieve and free me; and so help me by thy Holy Spirit, that I may now so commemorate the death of thy Son our Saviour JESUS CHRIST, as that when this short and painful life shall have an end, I may, for his sake, be received to everlasting happiness. Amen.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">While he was at church, the agreeable impressions upon his mind are thus commemorated:</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I was for some time distressed, but at last obtained, I hope from the GOD of Peace, more quiet than I have enjoyed for a long time. I had made no resolution, but as my heart grew lighter, my hopes revived, and my courage increased; and I wrote with my pencil in my Common Prayer Book,</p>
<p class="p26">&ldquo;Vita ordinanda.<br/>Biblia legenda.<br/>Theologiae opera danda.<br/>Serviendum et lætandum.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Mr. Steevens whose generosity is well known, joined Dr. Johnson in kind assistance to a female relation of Dr. Goldsmith, and desired that on her return to Ireland she would procure authentick particulars of the life of her celebrated relation. Concerning her there is the following letter: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To GEORGE STEEVENS, ESQ.</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;You will be glad to hear that from Mrs. Goldsmith, whom we lamented as drowned, I have received a letter full of gratitude to us all, with promise to make the enquiries which we recommended to her.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I would have had the honour of conveying this intelligence to Miss Caulfield, but that her letter is not at hand, and I know not the direction. You will tell the good news.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am, Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your most, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="p10"><span class="t4">&lsquo;MR. BOSWELL TO DR. JOHNSON.</span></p>
<p class="p21">&lsquo;Edinburgh, Feb. 14, 1777.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;My Dear Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;My state of epistolary accounts with you at present is extraordinary. The balance, as to number, is on your side. I am indebted to you for two letters; one dated the 16th of November, upon which very day I wrote to you, so that our letters were exactly exchanged, and one dated the 21st of December last.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;My heart was warmed with gratitude by the truely kind contents of both of them; and it is amazing and vexing that I have allowed so much time to elapse without writing to you. But delay is inherent in me, by nature or by bad habit. I waited till I should have an opportunity of paying you my compliments on a new year. I have procrastinated till the year is no longer new.</p>
<p class="p10">* * * * *</p>
<p class="p21">&lsquo;Dr. Memis&rsquo;s cause was determined against him, with £40 costs. The Lord President, and two other of the Judges, dissented from the majority, upon this ground; &mdash; that although there may have been no intention to injure him by calling him <span class="t8">Doctor of Medicine</span>, instead of <span class="t8">Physician</span>, yet, as he remonstrated against the designation before the charter was printed off, and represented that it was disagreeable, and even hurtful to him, it was ill-natured to refuse to alter it, and let him have the designation to which he was certainly entitled. My own opinion is, that our court has judged wrong. The defendants were <span class="t8">in malâ fide</span>, to persist in naming him in a way that he disliked. You remember poor Goldsmith, when he grew important, and wished to appear <span class="t8">Doctor Major</span> , could not bear your calling him <span class="t8">Goldy</span>. Would it not have been wrong to have named him so in your <span class="t8">Preface to Shakspeare</span>, or in any serious permanent writing of any sort? The difficulty is, whether an action should be allowed on such petty wrongs. <span class="t8">De minimis non curat lex</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The Negro cause is not yet decided. A memorial is preparing on the side of slavery. I shall send you a copy as soon as it is printed. Maclaurin is made happy by your approbation of his memorial for the black.</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;Macquarry was here in the winter, and we passed an evening together.<br/>The sale of his estate cannot be prevented.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Sir Allan Maclean&rsquo;s suit against the Duke of Argyle, for recovering the ancient inheritance of his family, is now fairly before all our judges. I spoke for him yesterday, and Maclaurin to-day; Crosbie spoke to-day against him. Three more counsel are to be heard, and next week the cause will be determined. I send you the <span class="t8">Informations</span>, or <span class="t8">Cases</span>, on each side, which I hope you will read. You said to me when we were under Sir Allan&rsquo;s hospitable roof, &ldquo;I will help him with my pen.&rdquo; You said it with a generous glow; and though his Grace of Argyle did afterwards mount you upon an excellent horse, upon which &ldquo;you looked like a Bishop,&rdquo; you must not swerve from your purpose at Inchkenneth. I wish you may understand the points at issue, amidst our Scotch law principles and phrases.</p>
<p class="p24">[Here followed a full state of the case, in which I endeavoured to make it as clear as I could to an Englishman, who had no knowledge of the formularies and technical language of the law of Scotland.]</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I shall inform you how the cause is decided here. But as it may be brought under the review of our Judges, and is certainly to be carried by appeal to the House of Lords, the assistance of such a mind as yours will be of consequence. Your paper on <span class="t8">Vicious Intromission</span> is a noble proof of what you can do even in Scotch law.</p>
<p class="p10">* * * * *</p>
<p class="p21">&lsquo;I have not yet distributed all your books. Lord Hailes and Lord Monboddo have each received one, and return you thanks. Monboddo dined with me lately, and having drank tea, we were a good while by ourselves, and as I knew that he had read the <span class="t8">Journey</span> superficially, as he did not talk of it as I wished, I brought it to him, and read aloud several passages; and then he talked so, that I told him he was to have a copy <span class="t8">from the authour</span>. He begged <span class="t8">that</span> might be marked on it.</p>
<p class="p10">* * * * *</p>
<p class="p21">&lsquo;I ever am, my dear Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your most faithful,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;And affectionate humble servant,</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;JAMES BOSWELL.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">&lsquo;SIR ALEXANDER DICK TO DR. SAMUEL JOHNSON.</span></p>
<p class="p21">&lsquo;Prestonfield, Feb. 17, 1777.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I had yesterday the honour of receiving your book of your <span class="t8">Journey to the Western Islands of Scotland</span>, which you was so good as to send me, by the hands of our mutual friend, Mr. Boswell, of Auchinleck; for which I return you my most hearty thanks; and after carefully reading it over again, shall deposit in my little collection of choice books, next our worthy friend&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Journey to Corsica</span>. As there are many things to admire in both performances, I have often wished that no Travels or Journeys should be published but those undertaken by persons of integrity and capacity to judge well, and describe faithfully, and in good language, the situation, condition, and manners of the countries past through. Indeed our country of Scotland, in spite of the union of the crowns, is still in most places so devoid of clothing, or cover from hedges and plantations, that it was well you gave your readers a sound <span class="t8">Monitoire</span> with respect to that circumstance. The truths you have told, and the purity of the language in which they are expressed, as your <span class="t8">Journey</span> is universally read, may, and already appear to have a very good effect. For a man of my acquaintance, who has the largest nursery for trees and hedges in this country, tells me, that of late the demand upon him for these articles is doubled, and sometimes tripled. I have, therefore, listed Dr. Samuel Johnson in some of my memorandums of the principal planters and favourers of the enclosures, under a name which I took the liberty to invent from the Greek, <span class="t8">Papadendrion</span>. Lord Auchinleck and some few more are of the list. I am told that one gentleman in the shire of Aberdeen, <span class="t8">viz</span>. Sir Archibald Grant, has planted above fifty millions of trees on a piece of very wild ground at Monimusk: I must enquire if he has fenced them well, before he enters my list; for, that is the soul of enclosing. I began myself to plant a little, our ground being too valuable for much, and that is now fifty years ago; and the trees, now in my seventy-fourth year, I look up to with reverence, and shew them to my eldest son now in his fifteenth year, and they are full the height of my country-house here, where I had the pleasure of receiving you, and hope again to have that satisfaction with our mutual friend, Mr. Boswell. I shall always continue, with the truest esteem, dear Doctor,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your much obliged,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;And obedient humble servant,</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">&lsquo;ALEXANDER DICK.&rsquo;</span></p>
<p class="p21">&lsquo;To JAMES BOSWELL, Esq.</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;It is so long since I heard any thing from you, that I am not easy about it; write something to me next post. When you sent your last letter, every thing seemed to be mending; I hope nothing has lately grown worse. I suppose young Alexander continues to thrive, and Veronica is now very pretty company. I do not suppose the lady is yet reconciled to me, yet let her know that I love her very well, and value her very much.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Dr. Blair is printing some sermons. If they are all like the first, which I have read, they are <span class="t8">sermones aurei, ac auro magis aurei</span>. It is excellently written both as to doctrine and language. Mr. Watson&rsquo;s book seems to be much esteemed.</p>
<p class="p10">* * * * *</p>
<p class="p21">&lsquo;Poor Beauclerk still continues very ill. Langton lives on as he used to do. His children are very pretty, and, I think, his lady loses her Scotch. Paoli I never see.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I have been so distressed by difficulty of breathing, that I lost, as was computed, six-and-thirty ounces of blood in a few days. I am better, but not well.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I wish you would be vigilant and get me Graham&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Telemachus</span> that was printed at Glasgow, a very little book; and <span class="t8">Johnstoni Poemata</span>, another little book, printed at Middleburgh.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Mrs. Williams sends her compliments, and promises that when you come hither, she will accommodate you as well as ever she can in the old room. She wishes to know whether you sent her book to Sir Alexander Gordon.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;My dear Boswell, do not neglect to write to me; for your kindness is one of the pleasures of my life, which I should be sorry to lose.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am, Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your humble servant,</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;February 18, 1777.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To DR. SAMUEL JOHNSON.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Edinburgh, Feb. 24, 1777.</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your letter dated the 18th instant, I had the pleasure to receive last post. Although my late long neglect, or rather delay, was truely culpable, I am tempted not to regret it, since it has produced me so valuable a proof of your regard. I did, indeed, during that inexcusable silence, sometimes divert the reproaches of my own mind, by fancying that I should hear again from you, inquiring with some anxiety about me, because, for aught you knew, I might have been ill.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;You are pleased to shew me, that my kindness is of some consequence to you. My heart is elated at the thought. Be assured, my dear Sir, that my affection and reverence for you are exalted and steady. I do not believe that a more perfect attachment ever existed in the history of mankind. And it is a noble attachment; for the attractions are Genius, Learning, and Piety.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your difficulty of breathing alarms me, and brings into my imagination an event, which although in the natural course of things, I must expect at some period, I cannot view with composure.</p>
<p class="p10">* * * * *</p>
<p class="p21">&lsquo;My wife is much honoured by what you say of her. She begs you may accept of her best compliments. She is to send you some marmalade of oranges of her own making.</p>
<p class="p10">* * * * *</p>
<p class="p21">&lsquo;I ever am, my dear Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your most obliged</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;And faithful humble servant,</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;JAMES BOSWELL.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To JAMES BOSWELL, ESQ.</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I have been much pleased with your late letter, and am glad that my old enemy Mrs. Boswell, begins to feel some remorse. As to Miss Veronica&rsquo;s Scotch, I think it cannot be helped. An English maid you might easily have; but she would still imitate the greater number, as they would be likewise those whom she must most respect. Her dialect will not be gross. Her Mamma has not much Scotch, and you have yourself very little. I hope she knows my name, and does not call me <span class="t8">Johnston</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The immediate cause of my writing is this: &mdash; One Shaw, who seems a modest and a decent man, has written an <span class="t8">Erse Grammar</span>, which a very learned Highlander, Macbean, has, at my request, examined and approved.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The book is very little, but Mr. Shaw has been persuaded by his friends to set it at half a guinea, though I advised only a crown, and thought myself liberal. You, whom the authour considers as a great encourager of ingenious men, will receive a parcel of his proposals and receipts. I have undertaken to give you notice of them, and to solicit your countenance. You must ask no poor man, because the price is really too high. Yet such a work deserves patronage.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;It is proposed to augment our club from twenty to thirty, of which I am glad; for as we have several in it whom I do not much like to consort with, I am for reducing it to a mere miscellaneous collection of conspicuous men, without any determinate character.</p>
<p class="p10">* * * * *</p>
<p class="p21">&lsquo;I am, dear Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Most affectionately your&rsquo;s,</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;March 11, 1777.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;My respects to Madam, to Veronica, to Alexander, to Euphemia, to<br/>David.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">&lsquo;MR. BOSWELL TO DR. JOHNSON.</span></p>
<p class="p21">&lsquo;Edinburgh, April 4, 1777.</p>
<p class="p24">[After informing him of the death of my little son David, and that I could not come to London this spring: &mdash; ]</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I think it hard that I should be a whole year without seeing you. May I presume to petition for a meeting with you in the autumn? You have, I believe, seen all the cathedrals in England, except that of Carlisle. If you are to be with Dr. Taylor, at Ashbourne, it would not be a great journey to come thither. We may pass a few most agreeable days there by ourselves, and I will accompany you a good part of the way to the southward again. Pray think of this.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;You forget that Mr. Shaw&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Erse Grammar</span> was put into your hands by myself last year. Lord Eglintoune put it into mine. I am glad that Mr. Macbean approves of it. I have received Mr. Shaw&rsquo;s Proposals for its publication, which I can perceive are written <span class="t8">by the hand of a</span> MASTER.</p>
<p class="p10">* * * * *</p>
<p class="p21">&lsquo;Pray get for me all the editions of <span class="t8">Walton&rsquo;s Lives</span>: I have a notion that the republication of them with Notes will fall upon me, between Dr. Home and Lord Hailes.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p26">Mr. Shaw&rsquo;s Proposals[dagger] for <span class="t8">An Analysis of the Scotch Celtick<br/>Language</span>, were thus illuminated by the pen of Johnson:</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Though the Erse dialect of the Celtick language has, from the earliest times, been spoken in Britain, and still subsists in the northern parts and adjacent islands, yet, by the negligence of a people rather warlike than lettered, it has hitherto been left to the caprice and judgement of every speaker, and has floated in the living voice, without the steadiness of analogy, or direction of rules. An Erse Grammar is an addition to the stores of literature; and its authour hopes for the indulgence always shewn to those that attempt to do what was never done before. If his work shall be found defective, it is at least all his own: he is not like other grammarians, a compiler or transcriber; what he delivers, he has learned by attentive observation among his countrymen, who perhaps will be themselves surprized to see that speech reduced to principles, which they have used only by imitation.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The use of this book will, however, not be confined to the mountains and islands; it will afford a pleasing and important subject of speculation, to those whose studies lead them to trace the affinity of languages, and the migrations of the ancient races, of mankind.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To DR. SAMUEL JOHNSON.</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;Glasgow, April 24, 1777.<br/>&lsquo;MY DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Our worthy friend Thrale&rsquo;s death having appeared in the newspapers, and been afterwards contradicted, I have been placed in a state of very uneasy uncertainty, from which I hoped to be relieved by you: but my hopes have as yet been vain. How could you omit to write to me on such an occasion? I shall wait with anxiety.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am going to Auchinleck to stay a fortnight with my father. It is better not to be there very long at one time. But frequent renewals of attention are agreeable to him.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Pray tell me about this edition of &ldquo;<span class="t8">The English Poets</span>, with a Preface, biographical and critical, to each Authour, by Samuel Johnson, LL.D.&rdquo; which I see advertised. I am delighted with the prospect of it. Indeed I am happy to feel that I am capable of being so much delighted with literature. But is not the charm of this publication chiefly owing to the <span class="t8">magnum nomen</span> in the front of it?</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;What do you say of Lord Chesterfield&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Memoirs and last Letters</span>?</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;My wife has made marmalade of oranges for you. I left her and my daughters and Alexander all well yesterday. I have taught Veronica to speak of you thus; &mdash; Dr. John<span class="t8">son</span>, not Jon<span class="t8">ston</span>.</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;I remain, my dear Sir,<br/>&lsquo;Your most affectionate,<br/>&lsquo;And obliged humble servant,<br/>&lsquo;JAMES BOSWELL.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;To JAMES BOSWELL, ESQ.<br/>&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The story of Mr. Thrale&rsquo;s death, as he had neither been sick nor in any other danger, made so little impression upon me, that I never thought about obviating its effects on any body else. It is supposed to have been produced by the English custom of making April fools, that is, of sending one another on some foolish errand on the first of April.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Tell Mrs. Boswell that I shall taste her marmalade cautiously at first. <span class="t8">Timeo Danaos et dona ferentes</span>. Beware, says the Italian proverb, of a reconciled enemy. But when I find it does me no harm, I shall then receive it and be thankful for it, as a pledge of firm, and, I hope, of unalterable kindness. She is, after all, a dear, dear lady.</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;Please to return Dr. Blair thanks for his sermons. The Scotch write<br/>English wonderfully well.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your frequent visits to Auchinleck, and your short stay there, are very laudable and very judicious. Your present concord with your father gives me great pleasure; it was all that you seemed to want.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;My health is very bad, and my nights are very unquiet. What can I do to mend them? I have for this summer nothing better in prospect than a journey into Staffordshire and Derbyshire, perhaps with Oxford and Birmingham in my way.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Make my compliments to Miss Veronica; I must leave it to <span class="t8">her</span> philosophy to comfort you for the loss of little David. You must remember, that to keep three out of four is more than your share. Mrs. Thrale has but four out of eleven.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am engaged to write little Lives, and little Prefaces, to a little edition of <span class="t8">The English Poets</span>. I think I have persuaded the book-sellers to insert something of Thomson; and if you could give me some information about him, for the life which we have is very scanty, I should be glad. I am, dear Sir,</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;Your most affectionate humble servant,<br/>&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;<br/>&lsquo;May 3, 1777.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">To those who delight in tracing the progress of works of literature, it will be an entertainment to compare the limited design with the ample execution of that admirable performance, <span class="t8">The Lives of the English Poets</span>, which is the richest, most beautiful and indeed most perfect production of Johnson&rsquo;s pen. His notion of it at this time appears in the preceding letter. He has a memorandum in this year, &lsquo;29 May, Easter Eve, I treated with booksellers on a bargain, but the time was not long.&rsquo; The bargain was concerning that undertaking; but his tender conscience seems alarmed lest it should have intruded too much on his devout preparation for the solemnity of the ensuing day. But, indeed, very little time was necessary for Johnson&rsquo;s concluding a treaty with the booksellers; as he had, I believe, less attention to profit from his labours than any man to whom literature has been a profession. I shall here insert from a letter to me from my late worthy friend Mr. Edward Dilly, though of a later date, an account of this plan so happily conceived; since it was the occasion of procuring for us an elegant collection of the best biography and criticism of which our language can boast.</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;TO JAMES BOSWELL, ESQ.<br/>&lsquo;Southill, Sept. 26, 1777.</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;You will find by this letter, that I am still in the same calm retreat, from the noise and bustle of London, as when I wrote to you last. I am happy to find you had such an agreeable meeting with your old friend Dr. Johnson; I have no doubt your stock is much increased by the interview; few men, nay I may say, scarcely any man, has got that fund of knowledge and entertainment as Dr. Johnson in conversation. When he opens freely, every one is attentive to what he says, and cannot fail of improvement as well as pleasure.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The edition of <span class="t8">The Poets</span>, now printing, will do honour to the English press; and a concise account of the life of each authour, by Dr. Johnson, will be a very valuable addition, and stamp the reputation of this edition superiour to any thing that is gone before. The first cause that gave rise to this undertaking, I believe, was owing to the little trifling edition of <span class="t8">The Poets</span>, printing by the Martins, at Edinburgh, and to be sold by Bell, in London. Upon examining the volumes which were printed, the type was found so extremely small, that many persons could not read them; not only this inconvenience attended it, but the inaccuracy of the press was very conspicuous. These reasons, as well as the idea of an invasion of what we call our Literary Property, induced the London Booksellers to print an elegant and accurate edition of all the English Poets of reputation, from Chaucer to the present time.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Accordingly a select number of the most respectable booksellers met on the occasion; and, on consulting together, agreed, that all the proprietors of copy-right in the various Poets should be summoned together; and when their opinions were given, to proceed immediately on the business. Accordingly a meeting was held, consisting of about forty of the most respectable booksellers of London, when it was agreed that an elegant and uniform edition of <span class="t8">The English Poets</span> should be immediately printed, with a concise account of the life of each authour, by Dr. Samuel Johnson; and that three persons should be deputed to wait upon Dr. Johnson, to solicit him to undertake the Lives, <span class="t8">viz</span>., T. Davies, Strahan, and Cadell. The Doctor very politely undertook it, and seemed exceedingly pleased with the proposal. As to the terms, it was left entirely to the Doctor to name his own: he mentioned two hundred guineas: it was immediately agreed to; and a farther compliment, I believe, will be made him. A committee was likewise appointed to engage the best engravers, <span class="t8">viz</span>., Bartolozzi, Sherwin, Hall, etc. Likewise another committee for giving directions about the paper, printing, etc., so that the whole will be conducted with spirit, and in the best manner, with respect to authourship, editorship, engravings, etc., etc. My brother will give you a list of the Poets we mean to give, many of which are within the time of the Act of Queen Anne, which Martin and Bell cannot give, as they have no property in them; the proprietors are almost all the booksellers in London, of consequence. I am, dear Sir,</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;Ever your&rsquo;s,<br/>&lsquo;EDWARD DILLY.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I shall afterwards have occasion to consider the extensive and varied range which Johnson took, when he was once led upon ground which he trod with a peculiar delight, having long been intimately acquainted with all the circumstances of it that could interest and please.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;DR. JOHNSON TO CHARLES O&rsquo;CONNOR, Esq.</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Having had the pleasure of conversing with Dr. Campbell about your character and your literary undertaking, I am resolved to gratify myself by renewing a correspondence which began and ended a great while ago, and ended, I am afraid, by my fault; a fault which, if you have not forgotten it, you must now forgive.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;If I have ever disappointed you, give me leave to tell you, that you have likewise disappointed me. I expected great discoveries in Irish antiquity, and large publications in the Irish language; but the world still remains at it was, doubtful and ignorant. What the Irish language is in itself, and to what languages it has affinity, are very interesting questions, which every man wishes to see resolved that has any philological or historical curiosity. Dr. Leland begins his history too late: the ages which deserve an exact enquiry are those times (for such there were) when Ireland was the school of the west, the quiet habitation of sanctity and literature. If you could give a history, though imperfect, of the Irish nation, from its conversion to Christianity to the invasion from England, you would amplify knowledge with new views and new objects. Set about it therefore, if you can: do what you can easily do without anxious exactness. Lay the foundation, and leave the superstructure to posterity. I am, Sir,</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;Your most humble servant,<br/>&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;<br/>&lsquo;May 19, 1777.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Early in this year came out, in two volumes quarto, the posthumous works of the learned Dr. Zachary Pearce, Bishop of Rochester; being <span class="t8">A Commentary, with Notes, on the four Evangelists and the Acts of the Apostles</span>, with other theological pieces. Johnson had now an opportunity of making a grateful return to that excellent prelate, who, we have seen, was the only person who gave him any assistance in the compilation of his <span class="t8">Dictionary</span>. The Bishop had left some account of his life and character, written by himself. To this Johnson made some valuable additions[dagger], and also furnished to the editor, the Reverend Mr. Derby, a Dedication[dagger], which I shall here insert, both because it will appear at this time with peculiar propriety; and because it will tend to propagate and increase that &lsquo;fervour of <span class="t8">Loyalty</span>,&rsquo; which in me, who boast of the name of TORY, is not only a principle, but a passion.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To THE KING.</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I presume to lay before your Majesty the last labours of a learned Bishop, who died in the toils and duties of his calling. He is now beyond the reach of all earthly honours and rewards; and only the hope of inciting others to imitate him, makes it now fit to be remembered, that he enjoyed in his life the favour of your Majesty.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The tumultuary life of Princes seldom permits them to survey the wide extent of national interest, without losing sight of private merit; to exhibit qualities which may be imitated by the highest and the humblest of mankind; and to be at once amiable and great.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Such characters, if now and then they appear in history, are contemplated with admiration. May it be the ambition of all your subjects to make haste with their tribute of reverence: and as posterity may learn from your Majesty how Kings should live, may they learn, likewise, from your people, how they should be honoured. I am,</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;May it please your Majesty,<br/>With the most profound respect,<br/>Your Majesty&rsquo;s<br/>Most dutiful and devoted<br/>Subject and Servant.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">In the summer he wrote a Prologue[*] which was spoken before <span class="t8">A Word to the Wise</span>, a comedy by Mr. Hugh Kelly, which had been brought upon the stage in 1770; but he being a writer for ministry, in one of the news-papers, it fell a sacrifice to popular fury, and in the playhouse phrase, was <span class="t8">damned</span>. By the generosity of Mr. Harris, the proprietor of Covent Garden theatre, it was now exhibited for one night, for the benefit of the authour&rsquo;s widow and children. To conciliate the favour of the audience was the intention of Johnson&rsquo;s Prologue, which, as it is not long, I shall here insert, as a proof that his poetical talents were in no degree impaired.</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;This night presents a play, which publick rage,<br/>Or right or wrong, once hooted from the stage:<br/>From zeal or malice, now no more we dread,<br/>For English vengeance <span class="t8">wars not with the dead</span>.<br/>A generous foe regards with pitying eye<br/>The man whom Fate has laid where all must lie.<br/>To wit, reviving from its authour&rsquo;s dust,<br/>Be kind, ye judges, or at least be just:<br/>Let no renewed hostilities invade<br/>Th&rsquo; oblivious grave&rsquo;s inviolable shade.<br/>Let one great payment every claim appease,<br/>And him who cannot hurt, allow to please;<br/>To please by scenes, unconscious of offence,<br/>By harmless merriment, or useful sense.<br/>Where aught of bright or fair the piece displays,<br/>Approve it only;&mdash; &rsquo;tis too late to praise.<br/>If want of skill or want of care appear,<br/>Forbear to hiss; &mdash; the poet cannot hear.<br/>By all, like him, must praise and blame be found,<br/>At last, a fleeting gleam, or empty sound;<br/>Yet then shall calm reflection bless the night,<br/>When liberal pity dignified delight;<br/>When pleasure fir&rsquo;d her torch at virtue&rsquo;s flame,<br/>And mirth was bounty with an humbler name.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">A circumstance which could not fail to be very pleasing to Johnson occurred this year. The Tragedy of <span class="t8">Sir Thomas Overbury</span>, written by his early companion in London, Richard Savage was brought out with alterations at Drury-lane theatre. The Prologue to it was written by Mr. Richard Brinsley Sheridan; in which, after describing very pathetically the wretchedness of</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;Ill-fated Savage, at whose birth was giv&rsquo;n<br/>No parent but the Muse, no friend but Heav&rsquo;n:&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">he introduced an elegant compliment to Johnson on his <span class="t8">Dictionary</span>, that wonderful performance which cannot be too often or too highly praised; of which Mr. Harris, in his <span class="t8">Philological Inquiries</span>, justly and liberally observes: &lsquo;Such is its merit, that our language does not possess a more copious, learned, and valuable work.&rsquo; The concluding, lines of this Prologue were these: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;So pleads the tale that gives to future times<br/>The son&rsquo;s misfortunes and the parent&rsquo;s crimes;<br/>There shall his fame (if own&rsquo;d to-night) survive,<br/>Fix&rsquo;d by THE HAND THAT BIDS OUR LANGUAGE LIVE.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Mr. Sheridan here at once did honour to his taste and to his liberality of sentiment, by shewing that he was not prejudiced from the unlucky difference which had taken place between his worthy father and Dr. Johnson. I have already mentioned, that Johnson was very desirous of reconciliation with old Mr. Sheridan. It will, therefore, not seem at all surprizing that he was zealous in acknowledging the brilliant merit of his son. While it had as yet been displayed only in the drama, Johnson proposed him as a member of THE LITERARY CLUB, observing, that &lsquo;He who has written the two best comedies of his age, is surely a considerable man.&rsquo; And he had, accordingly, the honour to be elected; for an honour it undoubtedly must be allowed to be, when it is considered of whom that society consists, and that a single black ball excludes a candidate.</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">&lsquo;MR. BOSWELL TO DR. JOHNSON.</span></p>
<p class="p21">&lsquo;July 9, 1777.</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">&lsquo;MY DEAR SIR,</span></p>
<p class="p21">&lsquo;For the health of my wife and children I have taken the little country-house at which you visited my uncle, Dr. Boswell, who, having lost his wife, is gone to live with his son. We took possession of our villa about a week ago; we have a garden of three quarters of an acre, well stocked with fruit-trees and flowers, and gooseberries and currants, and peas and beans, and cabbages, &amp;c. &amp;c., and my children are quite happy. I now write to you in a little study, from the window of which I see around me a verdant grove, and beyond it the lofty mountain called Arthur&rsquo;s Seat.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your last letter, in which you desire me to send you some additional information concerning Thomson, reached me very fortunately just as I was going to Lanark, to put my wife&rsquo;s two nephews, the young Campbells, to school there, under the care of Mr. Thomson, the master of it, whose wife is sister to the authour of <span class="t8">The Seasons</span>. She is an old woman; but her memory is very good; and she will with pleasure give me for you every particular that you wish to know, and she can tell. Pray then take the trouble to send me such questions as may lead to biographical materials. You say that the <span class="t8">Life</span> which we have of Thomson is scanty. Since I received your letter I have read his <span class="t8">Life</span>, published under the name of Cibber, but as you told me, really written by a Mr. Shiels; that written by Dr. Murdoch; one prefixed to an edition of the Seasons, published at Edinburgh, which is compounded of both, with the addition of an anecdote of Quin&rsquo;s relieving Thomson from prison; the abridgement of Murdoch&rsquo;s account of him, in the <span class="t8">Biographia Britannica</span>, and another abridgement of it in the <span class="t8">Biographical Dictionary</span>, enriched with Dr. Joseph Warton&rsquo;s critical panegyrick on the <span class="t8">Seasons</span> in his <span class="t8">Essay on the Genius and Writings of Pope</span>: from all these it appears to me that we have a pretty full account of this poet. However, you will, I doubt not, shew me many blanks, and I shall do what can be done to have them filled up. As Thomson never returned to Scotland, (which <span class="t8">you</span> will think very wise,) his sister can speak from her own knowledge only as to the early part of his life. She has some letters from him, which may probably give light as to his more advanced progress, if she will let us see them, which I suppose she will. I believe George Lewis Scott and Dr. Armstrong are now his only surviving companions, while he lived in and about London; and they, I dare say, can tell more of him than is yet known. My own notion is, that Thomson was a much coarser man than his friends are willing to acknowledge. His <span class="t8">Seasons</span> are indeed full of elegant and pious sentiments: but a rank soil, nay a dunghill, will produce beautiful flowers.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your edition of <span class="t8">The English Poets</span> will be very valuable, on account of the <span class="t8">Prefaces</span> and <span class="t8">Lives</span>. But I have seen a specimen of an edition of <span class="t8">The Poets</span> at the Apollo press, at Edinburgh, which, for excellence in printing and engraving, highly deserves a liberal encouragement.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Most sincerely do I regret the bad health and bad rest with which you have been afflicted; and I hope you are better. I cannot believe that the Prologue which you generously gave to Mr. Kelly&rsquo;s widow and children the other day, is the effusion of one in sickness and in disquietude: but external circumstances are never sure indications of the state of man. I send you a letter which I wrote to you two years ago at Wilton; and did not send it at the time, for fear of being reproved as indulging too much tenderness; and one written to you at the tomb of Melancthon, which I kept back, lest I should appear at once too superstitious and too enthusiastick. I now imagine that perhaps they may please you.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;You do not take the least notice of my proposal for our meeting at Carlisle. Though I have meritoriously refrained from visiting London this year, I ask you if it would not be wrong that I should be two years without having the benefit of your conversation, when, if you come down as far as Derbyshire, we may meet at the expence of a few days&rsquo; journeying, and not many pounds. I wish you to see Carlisle, which made me mention that place. But if you have not a desire to complete your tour of the English cathedrals, I will take a larger share of the road between this place and Ashbourne. So tell me <span class="t8">where</span> you will fix for our passing a few days by ourselves. Now don&rsquo;t cry &ldquo;foolish fellow,&rdquo; or &ldquo;idle dog.&rdquo; Chain your humour, and let your kindness play.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;You will rejoice to hear that Miss Macleod, of Rasay, is married to Colonel Mure Campbell, an excellent man, with a pretty good estate of his own, and the prospect of having the Earl of Loudoun&rsquo;s fortune and honours. Is not this a noble lot for our fair Hebridean? How happy am I that she is to be in Ayrshire. We shall have the Laird of Rasay, and old Malcolm, and I know not how many gallant Macleods, and bagpipes, &amp;c. &amp;c. at Auchinleck. Perhaps you may meet them all there.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Without doubt you have read what is called <span class="t8">The Life</span> of David Hume, written by himself, with the letter from Dr. Adam Smith subjoined to it. Is not this an age of daring effrontery? My friend Mr. Anderson, Professor of Natural Philosophy at Glasgow, at whose house you and I supped, and to whose care Mr. Windham, of Norfolk, was entrusted at that University, paid me a visit lately; and after we had talked with indignation and contempt of the poisonous productions with which this age is infested, he said there was now an excellent opportunity for Dr. Johnson to step forth. I agreed with him that you might knock Hume&rsquo;s and Smith&rsquo;s heads together, and make vain and ostentatious infidelity exceedingly ridiculous. Would it not be worth your while to crush such noxious weeds in the moral garden?</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;You have said nothing to me of Dr. Dodd. I know not how you think on that subject; though the newspapers give us a saying of your&rsquo;s in favour of mercy to him. But I own I am very desirous that the royal prerogative of remission of punishment should be employed to exhibit an illustrious instance of the regard which GOD&rsquo;s VICEGERENT will ever shew to piety and virtue. If for ten righteous men the ALMIGHTY would have spared Sodom, shall not a thousand acts of goodness done by Dr. Dodd counterbalance one crime? Such an instance would do more to encourage goodness, than his execution would do to deter from vice. I am not afraid of any bad consequence to society; for who will persevere for a long course of years in a distinguished discharge of religious duties, with a view to commit a forgery with impunity?</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Pray make my best compliments acceptable to Mr. and Mrs. Thrale, by assuring them of my hearty joy that the <span class="t8">Master</span>, as you call him, is alive. I hope I shall often taste his Champagne &mdash; <span class="t8">soberly</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I have not heard from Langton for a long time. I suppose he is as usual,</p>
<p class="p24">&ldquo;Studious the busy moments to deceive.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p10">* * * * *</p>
<p class="p21">&lsquo;I remain, my dear Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your most affectionate, and faithful humble servant,</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;JAMES BOSWELL.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On the 23rd of June, I again wrote to Dr. Johnson, enclosing a ship-master&rsquo;s receipt for a jar of orange-marmalade, and a large packet of Lord Hailes&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Annals of Scotland</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To JAMES BOSWELL, ESQ.</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I have just received your packet from Mr. Thrale&rsquo;s, but have not day-light enough to look much into it. I am glad that I have credit enough with Lord Hailes to be trusted with more copy. I hope to take more care of it than of the last. I return Mrs. Boswell my affectionate thanks for her present, which I value as a token of reconciliation.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Poor Dodd was put to death yesterday, in opposition to the recommendation of the jury &mdash; the petition of the city of London &mdash; and a subsequent petition signed by three-and-twenty thousand hands. Surely the voice of the publick, when it calls so loudly, and calls only for mercy, ought to be heard.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The saying that was given me in the papers I never spoke; but I wrote many of his petitions, and some of his letters. He applied to me very often. He was, I am afraid, long flattered with hopes of life; but I had no part in the dreadful delusion; for, as soon as the King had signed his sentence, I obtained from Mr. Chamier an account of the disposition of the court towards him, with a declaration that there <span class="t8">was no hope even of a respite</span>. This letter immediately was laid before Dodd; but he believed those whom he wished to be right, as it is thought, till within three days of his end. He died with pious composure and resolution. I have just seen the Ordinary that attended him. His address to his fellow-convicts offended the Methodists; but he had a Moravian with him much of his time. His moral character is very bad: I hope all is not true that is charged upon him. Of his behaviour in prison an account will be published.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I give you joy of your country-house, and your pretty garden; and hope some time to see you in your felicity. I was much pleased with your two letters that had been kept so long in store; and rejoice at Miss Rasay&rsquo;s advancement, and wish Sir Allan success.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I hope to meet you somewhere towards the north, but am loath to come quite to Carlisle. Can we not meet at Manchester? But we will settle it in some other letters.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Mr. Seward, a great favourite at Streatham, has been, I think, enkindled by our travels with a curiosity to see the Highlands. I have given him letters to you and Beattie. He desires that a lodging may be taken for him at Edinburgh, against his arrival. He is just setting out.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Langton has been exercising the militia. Mrs. Williams is, I fear, declining. Dr. Lawrence says he can do no more. She is gone to summer in the country, with as many conveniences about her as she can expect; but I have no great hope. We must all die: may we all be prepared!</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I suppose Miss Boswell reads her book, and young Alexander takes to his learning. Let me hear about them; for every thing that belongs to you, belongs in a more remote degree, and not, I hope, very remote, to, dear Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Yours affectionately,</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;June, 28, 1777.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">TO THE SAME.</span></p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;This gentleman is a great favourite at Streatham, and therefore you will easily believe that he has very valuable qualities. Our narrative has kindled him with a desire of visiting the Highlands, after having already seen a great part of Europe. You must receive him as a friend, and when you have directed him to the curiosities of Edinburgh, give him instructions and recommendations for the rest of his journey. I am, dear Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your most humble servant,</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;June 24, 1777.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson&rsquo;s benevolence to the unfortunate was, I am confident, as steady and active as that of any of those who have been most eminently distinguished for that virtue. Innumerable proofs of it I have no doubt will be for ever concealed from mortal eyes. We may, however, form some judgement of it, from the many and very various instances which have been discovered. One, which happened in the course of this summer, is remarkable from the name and connection of the person who was the object of it. The circumstance to which I allude is ascertained by two letters, one to Mr. Langton, and another to the Reverend Dr. Vyse, rector of Lambeth, son of the respectable clergyman at Lichfield, who was contemporary with Johnson, and in whose father&rsquo;s family Johnson had the happiness of being kindly received in his early years.</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">&lsquo;DR. JOHNSON TO BENNET LANGTON, ESQ.</span></p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I have lately been much disordered by a difficulty of breathing, but am now better. I hope your house is well.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;You know we have been talking lately of St. Cross, at Winchester; I have an old acquaintance whose distress makes him very desirous of an hospital, and I am afraid I have not strength enough to get him into the Chartreux. He is a painter, who never rose higher than to get his immediate living, and from that, at eighty-three, he is disabled by a slight stroke of the palsy, such as does not make him at all helpless on common occasions, though his hand is not steady enough for his art.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;My request is, that you will try to obtain a promise of the next vacancy, from the Bishop of Chester. It is not a great thing to ask, and I hope we shall obtain it. Dr. Warton has promised to favour him with his notice, and I hope he may end his days in peace. I am, Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your most humble servant,</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;June 29, 1777.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To THE REVEREND DR. VYSE, AT LAMBETH.</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I doubt not but you will readily forgive me for taking the liberty of requesting your assistance in recommending an old friend to his Grace the Archbishop, as Governour of the Charter-house.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;His name is De Groot; he was born at Gloucester; I have known him many years. He has all the common claims to charity, being old, poor, and infirm, in a great degree. He has likewise another claim, to which no scholar can refuse attention; he is by several descents the nephew of Hugo Grotius; of him, from whom perhaps every man of learning has learnt something. Let it not be said that in any lettered country a nephew of Grotius asked a charity and was refused.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am, reverend Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your most humble servant,</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;July 9, 1777.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">&lsquo;REVEREND DR. VYSE TO MR. BOSWELL.</span></p>
<p class="p21">&lsquo;Lambeth, June 9, 1787.</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I have searched in vain for the letter which I spoke of, and which I wished, at your desire, to communicate to you. It was from Dr. Johnson, to return me thanks for my application to Archbishop Cornwallis in favour of poor De Groot. He rejoices at the success it met with, and is lavish in the praise he bestows upon his favourite, Hugo Grotius. I am really sorry that I cannot find this letter, as it is worthy of the writer. That which I send you enclosed is at your service. It is very short, and will not perhaps be thought of any consequence, unless you should judge proper to consider it as a proof of the very humane part which Dr. Johnson took in behalf of a distressed and deserving person. I am, Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your most obedient humble servant,</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">&lsquo;W. VYSE.&rsquo;</span></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">&lsquo;DR. JOHNSON TO MR. EDWARD DILLY.</span></p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To the collection of <span class="t8">English Poets</span>, I have recommended the volume of Dr. Watts to be added; his name has long been held by me in veneration, and I would not willingly be reduced to tell of him only that he was born and died. Yet of his life I know very little, and therefore must pass him in a manner very unworthy of his character, unless some of his friends will favour me with the necessary information; many of them must be known to you; and by your influence, perhaps I may obtain some instruction. My plan does not exact much; but I wish to distinguish Watts, a man who never wrote but for a good purpose. Be pleased to do for me what you can.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am, Sir, your humble servant,</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;Bolt-Court, Fleet-street,<br/>July 7, 1777.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To DR. SAMUEL JOHNSON.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Edinburgh, July 15, 1777.</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">&lsquo;MY DEAR SIR,</span></p>
<p class="p21">&lsquo;The fate of poor Dr. Dodd made a dismal impression upon my mind.</p>
<p class="p10">* * * * *</p>
<p class="p21">&lsquo;I had sagacity enough to divine that you wrote his speech to the Recorder, before sentence was pronounced. I am glad you have written so much for him; and I hope to be favoured with an exact list of the several pieces when we meet.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I received Mr. Seward as the friend of Mr. and Mrs. Thrale, and as a gentleman recommended by Dr. Johnson to my attention. I have introduced him to Lord Kames, Lord Monboddo, and Mr. Nairne. He is gone to the Highlands with Dr. Gregory; when he returns I shall do more for him.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Sir Allan Maclean has carried that branch of his cause, of which we had good hopes: the President and one other Judge only were against him. I wish the House of Lords may do as well as the Court of Session has done. But Sir Allan has not the lands of <span class="t8">Brolos</span> quite cleared by this judgement, till a long account is made up of debts and interests on the one side, and rents on the other. I am, however, not much afraid of the balance.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Macquarry&rsquo;s estates, Staffa and all, were sold yesterday, and bought by a Campbell. I fear he will have little or nothing left out of the purchase money.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I send you the case against the negro, by Mr. Cullen, son to Dr. Cullen, in opposition to Maclaurin&rsquo;s for liberty, of which you have approved. Pray read this, and tell me what you think as a <span class="t8">Politician</span>, as well as a <span class="t8">Poet</span>, upon the subject.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Be so kind as to let me know how your time is to be distributed next autumn. I will meet you at Manchester, or where you please; but I wish you would complete your tour of the cathedrals, and come to Carlisle, and I will accompany you a part of the way homewards.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am ever,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Most faithfully yours,</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;JAMES BOSWELL.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To JAMES BOSWELL, ESQ.</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your notion of the necessity of an yearly interview is very pleasing to both my vanity and tenderness. I shall, perhaps, come to Carlisle another year; but my money has not held out so well as it used to do. I shall go to Ashbourne, and I purpose to make Dr. Taylor invite you. If you live awhile with me at his house, we shall have much time to ourselves, and our stay will be no expence to us or him. I shall leave London the 28th; and after some stay at Oxford and Lichfield, shall probably come to Ashbourne about the end of your Session, but of all this you shall have notice. Be satisfied we will meet somewhere.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;What passed between me and poor Dr. Dodd you shall know more fully when we meet.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Of lawsuits there is no end; poor Sir Allan must have another trial, for which, however, his antagonist cannot be much blamed, having two Judges on his side. I am more afraid of the debts than of the House of Lords. It is scarcely to be imagined to what debts will swell, that are daily increasing by small additions, and how carelessly in a state of desperation debts are contracted. Poor Macquarry was far from thinking that when he sold his islands he should receive nothing. For what were they sold? And what was their yearly value? The admission of money into the Highlands will soon put an end to the feudal modes of life, by making those men landlords who were not chiefs. I do not know that the people will suffer by the change; but there was in the patriarchal authority something venerable and pleasing. Every eye must look with pain on a <span class="t8">Campbell</span> turning the <span class="t8">Macquarries</span> at will out of their <span class="t8">sedes avitæ</span>, their hereditary island.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Sir Alexander Dick is the only Scotsman liberal enough not to be angry that I could not find trees, where trees were not. I was much delighted by his kind letter.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I remember Rasay with too much pleasure not to partake of the happiness of any part of that amiable family. Our ramble in the islands hangs upon my imagination, I can hardly help imagining that we shall go again. Pennant seems to have seen a great deal which we did not see: when we travel again let us look better about us.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;You have done right in taking your uncle&rsquo;s house. Some change in the form of life, gives from time to time a new epocha of existence. In a new place there is something new to be done, and a different system of thoughts rises in the mind. I wish I could gather currants in your garden. Now fit up a little study, and have your books ready at hand; do not spare a little money, to make your habitation pleasing to yourself.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I have dined lately with poor dear &mdash;&mdash; . I do not think he goes on well. His table is rather coarse, and he has his children too much about him. But he is a very good man.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Mrs. Williams is in the country to try if she can improve her health; she is very ill. Matters have come so about that she is in the country with very good accommodation; but age and sickness, and pride, have made her so peevish that I was forced to bribe the maid to stay with her, by a secret stipulation of half a crown a week over her wages.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Our CLUB ended its session about six weeks ago. We now only meet to dine once a fortnight. Mr. Dunning, the great lawyer, is one of our members. The Thrales are well.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I long to know how the Negro&rsquo;s cause will be decided. What is the opinion of Lord Auchinleck, or Lord Hailes, or Lord Monboddo?</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am, dear Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your most affectionate, &amp;c.</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;July 22, 1777.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">&lsquo;DR. JOHNSON TO MRS. BOSWELL.</span></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">&lsquo;MADAM,</span></p>
<p class="p21">&lsquo;Though I am well enough pleased with the taste of sweetmeats, very little of the pleasure which I received at the arrival of your jar of marmalade arose from eating it. I received it as a token of friendship, as a proof of reconciliation, things much sweeter than sweetmeats, and upon this consideration I return you, dear Madam, my sincerest thanks. By having your kindness I think I have a double security for the continuance of Mr. Boswell&rsquo;s, which it is not to be expected that any man can long keep, when the influence of a lady so highly and so justly valued operates against him. Mr. Boswell will tell you that I was always faithful to your interest, and always endeavoured to exalt you in his estimation. You must now do the same for me. We must all help one another, and you must now consider me, as, dear Madam,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your most obliged,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;And most humble servant,</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;July 22, 1777.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">&lsquo;MR. BOSWELL TO DR. JOHNSON.</span></p>
<p class="p21">&lsquo;Edinburgh, July 28, 1777.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;My Dear Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;This is the day on which you were to leave London and I have been amusing myself in the intervals of my law-drudgery, with figuring you in the Oxford post-coach. I doubt, however, if you have had so merry a journey as you and I had in that vehicle last year, when you made so much sport with Gwyn, the architect. Incidents upon a journey are recollected with peculiar pleasure; they are preserved in brisk spirits, and come up again in our minds, tinctured with that gaiety, or at least that animation with which we first perceived them.&rsquo;</p>

<p class="p24">&lsquo;To JAMES BOSWELL, ESQ.</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Do not disturb yourself about our interviews; I hope we shall have many; nor think it any thing hard or unusual, that your design of meeting me is interrupted. We have both endured greater evils, and have greater evils to expect.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Mrs. Boswell&rsquo;s illness makes a more serious distress. Does the blood rise from her lungs or from her stomach? From little vessels broken in the stomach there is no danger. Blood from the lungs is, I believe, always frothy, as mixed with wind. Your physicians know very well what is to be done. The loss of such a lady would, indeed, be very afflictive, and I hope she is in no danger. Take care to keep her mind as easy as is possible.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I have left Langton in London. He has been down with the militia, and is again quiet at home, talking to his little people, as, I suppose, you do sometimes. Make my compliments to Miss Veronica. The rest are too young for ceremony.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I cannot but hope that you have taken your country-house at a very seasonable time, and that it may conduce to restore, or establish Mrs. Boswell&rsquo;s health, as well as provide room and exercise for the young ones. That you and your lady may both be happy, and long enjoy your happiness, is the sincere and earnest wish of, dear Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your most, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="p27">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am this day come to Ashbourne, and have only to tell you, that Dr. Taylor says you shall be welcome to him, and you know how welcome you will be to me. Make haste to let me know when you may be expected.</p>

<p class="p24">&lsquo;August 30, 1777.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To JAMES BOSWELL, ESQ.</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;On Saturday I wrote a very short letter, immediately upon my arrival hither, to shew you that I am not less desirous of the interview than yourself. Life admits not of delays; when pleasure can be had, it is fit to catch it. Every hour takes away part of the things that please us, and perhaps part of our disposition to be pleased. When I came to Lichfield, I found my old friend Harry Jackson dead. It was a loss, and a loss not to be repaired, as he was one of the companions of my childhood. I hope we may long continue to gain friends, but the friends which merit or usefulness can procure us, are not able to supply the place of old acquaintance, with whom the days of youth may be retraced, and those images revived which gave the earliest delight. If you and I live to be much older, we shall take great delight in talking over the Hebridean Journey.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;In the mean time it may not be amiss to contrive some other little adventure, but what it can be I know not; leave it, as Sidney says,</p>
<p class="p24">&ldquo;To virtue, fortune, wine, and woman&rsquo;s breast;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">for I believe Mrs. Boswell must have some part in the consultation.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;One thing you will like. The Doctor, so far as I can judge, is likely to leave us enough to ourselves. He was out to-day before <span class="t8">I</span> came down, and, I fancy, will stay out till dinner. I have brought the papers about poor Dodd, to show you, but you will soon have dispatched them.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Before I came away I sent poor Mrs. Williams into the country, very ill of a pituitous defluxion, which wastes her gradually away, and which her physician declares himself unable to stop. I supplied her as far as could be desired, with all conveniences to make her excursion and abode pleasant and useful. But I am afraid she can only linger a short time in a morbid state of weakness and pain.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The Thrales, little and great, are all well, and purpose to go to Brighthelmstone at Michaelmas. They will invite me to go with them, and perhaps I may go, but I hardly think I shall like to stay the whole time; but of futurity we know but little.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Mrs. Porter is well; but Mrs. Aston, one of the ladies at Stowhill, has been struck with a palsy, from which she is not likely ever to recover. How soon may such a stroke fall upon us!</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Write to me, and let us know when we may expect you.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am, dear Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your most humble servant,</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Ashbourne, Sept. 1, 1777.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">&lsquo;MR. BOSWELL TO DR. JOHNSON.</span></p>
<p class="p21">&lsquo;Edinburgh, Sept. 9, 1777.</p>
<p class="p24">[After informing him that I was to set out next day, in order to meet him at Ashbourne.]</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I have a present for you from Lord Hailes; the fifth book of <span class="t8">Lactantius</span>, which he has published with Latin notes. He is also to give you a few anecdotes for your <span class="t8">Life of Thomson</span>, who I find was private tutor to the present Earl of Hadington, Lord Hailes&rsquo;s cousin, a circumstance not mentioned by Dr. Murdoch. I have keen expectations of delight from your edition of <span class="t8">The English Poets</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am sorry for poor Mrs. Williams&rsquo;s situation. You will, however, have the comfort of reflecting on your kindness to her. Mr. Jackson&rsquo;s death, and Mrs. Aston&rsquo;s palsy, are gloomy circumstances. Yet surely we should be habituated to the uncertainty of life and health. When my mind is unclouded by melancholy, I consider the temporary distresses of this state of being, as &ldquo;light afflictions,&rdquo; by stretching my mental view into that glorious after-existence, when they will appear to be as nothing. But present pleasures and present pains must be felt. I lately read <span class="t8">Rasselas</span> over again with great satisfaction.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Since you are desirous to hear about Macquarry&rsquo;s sale I shall inform you particularly. The gentleman who purchased Ulva is Mr. Campbell, of Auchnaba: our friend Macquarry was proprietor of two-thirds of it, of which the rent was £156 5s 1-1/2d. This parcel was set up at £4,069 5s. 1d., but it sold for no less than £5,540. The other third of Ulva, with the island of Staffa, belonged to Macquarry of Ormaig. Its rent, including that of Staffa, £83 12s. 2-1/2d. set up at £2178 16s. 4d. &mdash; sold for no less than £3,540. The Laird of Col wished to purchase Ulva, but he thought the price too high. There may, indeed, be great improvements made there, both in fishing and agriculture; but the interest of the purchase-money exceeds the rent so very much, that I doubt if the bargain will be profitable. There is an island called Little Colonsay, of £10 yearly rent, which I am informed has belonged to the Macquarrys of Ulva for many ages, but which was lately claimed by the Presbyterian Synod of Argyll, in consequence of a grant made to them by Queen Anne. It is believed that their claim will be dismissed, and that Little Colonsay will also be sold for the advantage of Macquarry&rsquo;s creditors. What think you of purchasing this island, and endowing a school or college there, the master to be a clergyman of the Church of England? How venerable would such an institution make the name of DR. SAMUEL JOHNSON in the Hebrides! I have, like yourself, a wonderful pleasure in recollecting our travels in those islands. The pleasure is, I think, greater than it reasonably should be, considering that we had not much either of beauty or elegance to charm our imaginations, or of rude novelty to astonish. Let us, by all means, have another expedition. I shrink a little from our scheme of going up the Baltick. I am sorry you have already been in Wales; for I wish to see it. Shall we go to Ireland, of which I have seen but little? We shall try to strike out a plan when we are at Ashbourne. I am ever,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your most faithful humble servant,</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;JAMES BOSWELL.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To JAMES BOSWELL, ESQ.</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I write to be left at Carlisle, as you direct me; but you cannot have it. Your letter, dated Sept. 6, was not at this place till this day, Thursday, Sept. 11; and I hope you will be here before this is at Carlisle. However, what you have not going, you may have returning; and as I believe I shall not love you less after our interview, it will then be as true as it is now, that I set a very high value upon your friendship, and count your kindness as one of the chief felicities of my life. Do not fancy that an intermission of writing is a decay of kindness. No man is always in a disposition to write; nor has any man at all times something to say.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;That distrust which intrudes so often on your mind is a mode of melancholy, which, if it be the business of a wise man to be happy, it is foolish to indulge; and if it be a duty to preserve our faculties entire for their proper use, it is criminal. Suspicion is very often an useless pain. From that, and all other pains, I wish you free and safe; for I am, dear Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Most affectionately yours,</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Ashbourne, Sept. 11, 1777.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Sunday evening Sept. 14, I arrived at Ashbourne, and drove directly up to Dr. Taylor&rsquo;s door. Dr. Johnson and he appeared before I had got out of the post-chaise, and welcomed me cordially.</p>
<p class="p24">I told them that I had travelled all the preceding night, and gone to bed at Leek in Staffordshire; and that when I rose to go to church in the afternoon, I was informed there had been an earthquake, of which, it seems, the shock had been felt in some degree at Ashbourne. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, it will be much exaggerated in popular talk: for, in the first place, the common people do not accurately adapt their thoughts to the objects; nor, secondly, do they accurately adapt their words to their thoughts: they do not mean to lie; but, taking no pains to be exact, they give you very false accounts. A great part of their language is proverbial. If anything rocks at all, they say <span class="t8">it rocks like a cradle</span>; and in this way they go on.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">The subject of grief for the loss of relations and friends being introduced, I observed that it was strange to consider how soon it in general wears away. Dr. Taylor mentioned a gentleman of the neighbourhood as the only instance he had ever known of a person who had endeavoured to <span class="t8">retain</span> grief. He told Dr. Taylor, that after his Lady&rsquo;s death, which affected him deeply, he <span class="t8">resolved</span> that the grief, which he cherished with a kind of sacred fondness, should be lasting; but that he found he could not keep it long. JOHNSON. &lsquo;All grief for what cannot in the course of nature be helped, soon wears away; in some sooner, indeed, in some later; but it never continues very long, unless where there is madness, such as will make a man have pride so fixed in his mind, as to imagine himself a King; or any other passion in an unreasonable way: for all unnecessary grief is unwise, and therefore will not be long retained by a sound mind. If, indeed, the cause of our grief is occasioned by our own misconduct, if grief is mingled with remorse of conscience, it should be lasting.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;But, Sir, we do not approve of a man who very soon forgets the loss of a wife or a friend.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, we disapprove of him, not because he soon forgets his grief, for the sooner it is forgotten the better, but because we suppose, that if he forgets his wife or his friend soon, he has not had much affection for them.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I was somewhat disappointed in finding that the edition of <span class="t8">The English Poets</span>, for which he was to write Prefaces and Lives, was not an undertaking directed by him: but that he was to furnish a Preface and Life to any poet the booksellers pleased. I asked him if he would do this to any dunce&rsquo;s works, if they should ask him. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Yes, Sir; and <span class="t8">say</span> he was a dunce.&rsquo; My friend seemed now not much to relish talking of this edition.</p>
<p class="p24">On Monday, September 15, Dr. Johnson observed, that every body commended such parts of his <span class="t8">Journey to the Western Islands</span>, as were in their own way. &lsquo;For instance, (said he,) Mr. Jackson (the all-knowing) told me there was more good sense upon trade in it, than he should hear in the House of Commons in a year, except from Burke. Jones commended the part which treats of language; Burke that which describes the inhabitants of mountainous countries.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">After breakfast, Johnson carried me to see the garden belonging to the school of Ashbourne, which is very prettily formed upon a bank, rising gradually behind the house. The Reverend Mr. Langley, the head-master, accompanied us.</p>
<p class="p24">While we sat basking in the sun upon a seat here, I introduced a common subject of complaint, the very small salaries which many curates have, and I maintained, &lsquo;that no man should be invested with the character of a clergyman, unless he has a security for such an income as will enable him to appear respectable; that, therefore, a clergyman should not be allowed to have a curate, unless he gives him a hundred pounds a year; if he cannot do that, let him perform the duty himself.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;To be sure, Sir, it is wrong that any clergyman should be without a reasonable income; but as the church revenues were sadly diminished at the Reformation, the clergy who have livings cannot afford, in many instances, to give good salaries to curates, without leaving themselves too little; and, if no curate were to be permitted unless he had a hundred pounds a year, their number would be very small, which would be a disadvantage, as then there would not be such choice in the nursery for the church, curates being candidates for the higher ecclesiastical offices, according to their merit and good behaviour.&rsquo; He explained the system of the English Hierarchy exceedingly well. &lsquo;It is not thought fit (said he) to trust a man with the care of a parish till he has given proof as a curate that he shall deserve such a trust.&rsquo; This is an excellent <span class="t8">theory</span>; and if the <span class="t8">practice</span> were according to it, the Church of England would be admirable indeed. However, as I have heard Dr. Johnson observe as to the Universities, bad practice does not infer that the <span class="t8">constitution</span> is bad.</p>
<p class="p24">We had with us at dinner several of Dr. Taylor&rsquo;s neighbours, good civil gentlemen, who seemed to understand Dr. Johnson very well, and not to consider him in the light that a certain person did, who being struck, or rather stunned by his voice and manner, when he was afterwards asked what he thought of him, answered, &lsquo;He&rsquo;s a tremendous companion.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson told me, that &lsquo;Taylor was a very sensible acute man, and had a strong mind; that he had great activity in some respects, and yet such a sort of indolence, that if you should put a pebble upon his chimney-piece, you would find it there, in the same state, a year afterwards.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">And here is the proper place to give an account of Johnson&rsquo;s humane and zealous interference in behalf of the Reverend Dr. William Dodd, formerly Prebendary of Brecon, and chaplain in ordinary to his Majesty; celebrated as a very popular preacher, an encourager of charitable institutions, and authour of a variety of works, chiefly theological. Having unhappily contracted expensive habits of living, partly occasioned by licentiousness of manners, he in an evil hour, when pressed by want of money, and dreading an exposure of his circumstances, forged a bond of which he attempted to avail himself to support his credit, flattering himself with hopes that he might be able to repay its amount without being detected. The person, whose name he thus rashly and criminally presumed to falsify, was the Earl of Chesterfield, to whom he had been tutor, and who, he perhaps, in the warmth of his feelings, flattered himself would have generously paid the money in case of an alarm being taken, rather than suffer him to fall a victim to the dreadful consequences of violating the law against forgery, the most dangerous crime in a commercial country; but the unfortunate divine had the mortification to find that he was mistaken. His noble pupil appeared against him, and he was capitally convicted.</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson told me that Dr. Dodd was very little acquainted with him, having been but once in his company, many years previous to this period (which was precisely the state of my own acquaintance with Dodd); but in his distress he bethought himself of Johnson&rsquo;s persuasive power of writing, if haply it might avail to obtain for him the Royal Mercy. He did not apply to him, directly, but, extraordinary as it may seem, through the late Countess of Harrington, who wrote a letter to Johnson, asking him to employ his pen in favour of Dodd. Mr. Allen, the printer, who was Johnson&rsquo;s landlord and next neighbour in Bolt-court, and for whom he had much kindness, was one of Dodd&rsquo;s friends, of whom to the credit of humanity be it recorded, that he had many who did not desert him, even after his infringement of the law had reduced him to the state of a man under sentence of death. Mr. Allen told me that he carried Lady Harrington&rsquo;s letter to Johnson, that Johnson read it walking up and down his chamber, and seemed much agitated, after which he said, &lsquo;I will do what I can;&rsquo; &mdash; and certainly he did make extraordinary exertions.</p>
<p class="p24">He this evening, as he had obligingly promised in one of his letters, put into my hands the whole series of his writings upon this melancholy occasion, and I shall present my readers with the abstract which I made from the collection; in doing which I studied to avoid copying what had appeared in print, and now make part of the edition of <span class="t8">Johnson&rsquo;s Works</span>, published by the Booksellers of London, but taking care to mark Johnson&rsquo;s variations in some of the pieces there exhibited.</p>
<p class="p24">Dr. Johnson wrote in the first place, Dr. Dodd&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Speech to the Recorder of London</span>, at the Old-Bailey, when sentence of death was about to be pronounced upon him.</p>
<p class="p24">He wrote also <span class="t8">The Convict&rsquo;s Address to his unhappy Brethren</span>, a sermon delivered by Dr. Dodd, in the chapel of Newgate.</p>
<p class="p24">According to Johnson&rsquo;s manuscript it began thus after the text, <span class="t8">What shall I do to be saved?</span> &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;These were the words with which the keeper, to whose custody Paul and Silas were committed by their prosecutors, addressed his prisoners, when he saw them freed from their bonds by the perceptible agency of divine favour, and was, therefore, irresistibly convinced that they were not offenders against the laws, but martyrs to the truth.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Dr. Johnson was so good as to mark for me with his own hand, on a copy of this sermon which is now in my possession, such passages as were added by Dr. Dodd. They are not many: whoever will take the trouble to look at the printed copy, and attend to what I mention, will be satisfied of this.</p>
<p class="p24">There is a short introduction by Dr. Dodd, and he also inserted this sentence, &lsquo;You see with what confusion and dishonour I now stand before you; &mdash; no more in the pulpit of instruction, but on this humble seat with yourselves.&rsquo; The <span class="t8">notes</span> are entirely Dodd&rsquo;s own, and Johnson&rsquo;s writing ends at the words, &lsquo;the thief whom he pardoned on the cross.&rsquo; What follows was supplied by Dr. Dodd himself.</p>
<p class="p24">The other pieces mentioned by Johnson in the above-mentioned collection, are two letters, one to the Lord Chancellor Bathurst, (not Lord North, as is erroneously supposed,) and one to Lord Mansfield; &mdash; A Petition from Dr. Dodd to the King; &mdash; A Petition from Mrs. Dodd to the Queen; &mdash; Observations of some length inserted in the news-papers, on occasion of Earl Percy&rsquo;s having presented to his Majesty a petition for mercy to Dodd, signed by twenty thousand people, but all in vain. He told me that he had also written a petition from the city of London; &lsquo;but (said he, with a significant smile) they <span class="t8">mended</span> it.&rsquo; The last of these articles which Johnson wrote is <span class="t8">Dr. Dodd&rsquo;s last solemn Declaration</span>, which he left with the sheriff at the place of execution. Here also my friend marked the variations on a copy of that piece now in my possession. Dodd inserted, &lsquo;I never knew or attended to the calls of frugality, or the needful minuteness of painful oeconomy;&rsquo; and in the next sentence he introduced the words which I distinguish by <span class="t8">Italicks</span>; &lsquo;My life for some <span class="t8">few unhappy</span> years past has been <span class="t8">dreadfully erroneous</span>.&rsquo; Johnson&rsquo;s expression was <span class="t8">hypocritical</span>; but his remark on the margin is &lsquo;With this he said he could not charge himself.&rsquo;</p>
