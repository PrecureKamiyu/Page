As they say inside of Google, when you have just your desktop machine, failure is rare; when you’re in a data center with thousands of machines, failure is happening all the time. The key to any distributed system is how you deal with that failure.</p><p style="padding-left: 68pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">We have also seen that communication forms the heart of any dis- tributed system. A common abstraction of that communication is found in remote procedure call (RPC), which enables clients to make remote calls on servers; the RPC package handles all of the gory details, includ- ing timeout/retry and acknowledgment, in order to deliver a service that closely mirrors a local procedure call.</p><p style="padding-left: 68pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">The best way to really understand an RPC package is of course to use one yourself. Sun’s RPC system, using the stub compiler <span class="s41">rpcgen</span>, is a common one, and is widely available on systems today, including Linux. Try it out, and see what all the fuss is about.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part516.htm">&lt; 上一个</a><span> | </span><a href="../ostep.html">内容</a><span> | </span><a href="part518.htm">下一个 &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
