<p class="p21">After Johnson was forced to abandon his studies at Oxford in 1729 due to a lack of funds, it is believed he lived with his parents above their bookshop in Lichfield. He experienced bouts of mental anguish and physical pain during years of illness, suffering from tics and gesticulations, which are nowadays identified as symptoms of Tourette syndrome. By 1731 Johnson&rsquo;s father was deeply in debt and had lost much of his standing in Lichfield and he died shortly after, having developed an inflammatory fever in December 1731.</p>
<p class="p22">In spite of these hardships, Johnson eventually found employment as undermaster at a school in Market Bosworth, which was run by Sir Wolstan Dixie, 4th Baronet who allowed Johnson to teach without a degree. Although Johnson was treated as a servant, he found pleasure in teaching, though at times he complained of finding it weary work. After an argument with Dixie he left the school, and by June 1732 he had once again returned home.</p>
<p class="p22">Johnson then spent time with his friend Edmund Hector, who was living in the home of the publisher Thomas Warren. Warren was starting his <span class="t8">Birmingham Journal</span>, destined to become the city&rsquo;s first printed newspaper, and he enlisted Johnson&rsquo;s help in writing articles. This connection with Warren grew and Johnson proposed a translation of the Portuguese Jesuit missionary Jeronimo Lobo&rsquo;s account of the Abyssinians, having previously read Le Grand&rsquo;s French translations and thought that a shorter version might be &ldquo;useful and profitable&rdquo;. Instead of writing the whole work himself, he dictated to Hector, who then took the copy to the printer and made corrections. Johnson&rsquo;s <span class="t8">A Voyage to Abyssinia</span> was published a year later, launching Johnson&rsquo;s solo career as a published author.</p>
