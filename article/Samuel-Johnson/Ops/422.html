<title>FORT AUGUSTUS</title>

<h2 class="h20"><a id="a890"></a>FORT AUGUSTUS</h2>
<p class="p21">In the morning we viewed the fort, which is much less than that of St. George, and is said to be commanded by the neighbouring hills.&nbsp; It was not long ago taken by the Highlanders.&nbsp; But its situation seems well chosen for pleasure, if not for strength; it stands at the head of the lake, and, by a sloop of sixty tuns, is supplied from Inverness with great convenience.</p>
<p class="p24">We were now to cross the Highlands towards the western coast, and to content ourselves with such accommodations, as a way so little frequented could afford.&nbsp; The journey was not formidable, for it was but of two days, very unequally divided, because the only house, where we could be entertained, was not further off than a third of the way.&nbsp; We soon came to a high hill, which we mounted by a military road, cut in traverses, so that as we went upon a higher stage, we saw the baggage following us below in a contrary direction.&nbsp; To make this way, the rock has been hewn to a level with labour that might have broken the perseverance of a Roman legion.</p>
<p class="p24">The country is totally denuded of its wood, but the stumps both of oaks and firs, which are still found, shew that it has been once a forest of large timber.&nbsp; I do not remember that we saw any animals, but we were told that, in the mountains, there are stags, roebucks, goats and rabbits.</p>
<p class="p24">We did not perceive that this tract was possessed by human beings, except that once we saw a corn field, in which a lady was walking with some gentlemen.&nbsp; Their house was certainly at no great distance, but so situated that we could not descry it.</p>
<p class="p24">Passing on through the dreariness of solitude, we found a party of soldiers from the fort, working on the road, under the superintendence of a serjeant.&nbsp; We told them how kindly we had been treated at the garrison, and as we were enjoying the benefit of their labours, begged leave to shew our gratitude by a small present.</p>
