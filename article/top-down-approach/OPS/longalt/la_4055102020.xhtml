Interaction 1 is depicted as a blue arrow that extends vertically upwards to a server labeled "Local DNS server, dns.nyu.edu." Interaction 2 is depicted as an arrow that points diagonally upward and to the right to a server labeled "Root DNS server." Interaction 3 is depicted as an arrow pointing diagonally downward and to the right to a server labeled "TLD DNS server." Interaction 4 is depicted as an arrow pointing vertically downward to a server labeled "Authoritative DNS server, dns.umass.edu." Beneath this is a computer labeled "gaia.cs.umass.edu." Interaction 5 is depicted as an arrow that points vertically upward from the "Authoritative DNS server" to the "TLD DNS server." Interaction 6 is depicted as an arrow pointing diagonally upward and to the left to the "Root DNS server." Interaction 7 is depicted as an arrow pointing diagonally downward and to the left to the "Local DNS server, dns.nyu.edu." And interaction 8 is depicted as an arrow pointing vertically downward to the original requesting host, cse.nyu.edu.</p></div></section></body></html>
