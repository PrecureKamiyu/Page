<p class="p24">Pope had, in proportions very nicely adjusted to each other, all the qualities that constitute genius. He had invention, by which new trains of events are formed, and new scenes of imagery displayed, as in the Rape of the Lock; and by which extrinsick and adventitious embellishments and illustrations are connected with a known subject, as in the Essay on Criticism. He had imagination, which strongly impresses on the writer&rsquo;s mind, and enables him to convey to the reader, the various forms of nature, incidents of life, and energies of passion, as in his Eloisa, Windsor Forest, and Ethick Epistles. He had judgment, which selects from life or nature what the present purpose requires, and by separating the essence of things from its concomitants, often makes the representation more powerful than the reality: and he had colours of language always before him, ready to decorate his matter with every grace of elegant expression, as when he accommodates his diction to <span class="t8">the wonderful multiplicity</span> of Homer&rsquo;s sentiments and descriptions.</p>
<p class="p24">Poetical expression includes sound as well as meaning; &ldquo;Musick,&rdquo; says Dryden, &ldquo;is inarticulate poetry;&rdquo; among the excellencies of Pope, therefore, must be mentioned the melody of his metre. By perusing the works of Dryden, he discovered the most perfect fabrick of English verse, and habituated himself to that only which he found the best; in consequence of which restraint, his poetry has been censured as too uniformly musical, and as glutting the ear with unvaried sweetness. I suspect this objection to be the cant of those who judge by principles rather than perception; and who would even themselves have less pleasure in his works, if he had tried to relieve attention by studied discords, or affected to break his lines and vary his pauses.</p>
<p class="p24">But, though he was thus careful of his versification, he did not oppress his powers with superfluous rigour. He seems to have thought, with Boileau, that the practice of writing might be refined till the difficulty should overbalance the advantage. The construction of his language is not always strictly grammatical; with those rhymes, which prescription had conjoined, he contented himself, without regard to Swift&rsquo;s remonstrances, though there was no striking consonance; nor was he very careful to vary his terminations, or to refuse admission, at a small distance, to the same rhymes.</p>
<p class="p24">To Swift&rsquo;s edict, for the exclusion of alexandrines and triplets, he paid little regard; he admitted them, but, in the opinion of Fenton, too rarely; he uses them more liberally in his translation than his poems.</p>
<p class="p24">He has a few double rhymes; and always, I think, unsuccessfully, except once in the Rape of the Lock.</p>
<p class="p24">Expletives he very early ejected from his verses; but he now and then admits an epithet rather commodious than important. Each of the six first lines of the Iliad might lose two syllables with very little diminution of the meaning; and sometimes, after all his art and labour, one verse seems to be made for the sake of another. In his latter productions the diction is sometimes vitiated by French idioms, with which Bolingbroke had, perhaps, infected him.</p>
<p class="p24">I have been told, that the couplet by which he declared his own ear to be most gratified, was this:</p>
<p class="p26">Lo, where Mæotis sleeps, and hardly flows<br/>The freezing Tanais through a waste of snows.</p>
<p class="p24">But the reason of this preference I cannot discover.</p>
<p class="p24">It is remarked by Watts, that there is scarcely a happy combination of words, or a phrase poetically elegant, in the English language, which Pope has not inserted into his version of Homer. How he obtained possession of so many beauties of speech, it were desirable to know. That he gleaned from authors, obscure as well as eminent, what he thought brilliant or useful, and preserved it all in a regular collection, is not unlikely. When, in his last years, Hall&rsquo;s Satires were shown him, he wished that he had seen them sooner.</p>
<p class="p24">New sentiments, and new images, others may produce; but to attempt any further improvement of versification will be dangerous. Art and diligence have now done their best, and what shall be added will be the effort of tedious toil and needless curiosity.</p>
<p class="p24">After all this, it is, surely, superfluous to answer the question that has once been asked, whether Pope was a poet? otherwise than by asking in return, if Pope be not a poet, where is poetry to be found? To circumscribe poetry by a definition, will only show the narrowness of the definer, though a definition, which shall exclude Pope, will not easily be made. Let us look round upon the present time, and back upon the past; let us inquire to whom the voice of mankind has decreed the wreath of poetry; let their productions be examined, and their claims stated, and the pretensions of Pope will be no more disputed. Had he given the world only his version, the name of poet must have been allowed him: if the writer of the Iliad were to class his successors, he would assign a very high place to his translator, without requiring any other evidence of genius.</p>
<p class="p20">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p24">The following Letter, of which the original is in the hands of lord Hardwicke, was communicated to me by the kindness of Mr. Jodrell.</p>
<p class="p24">&ldquo;To Mr. Bridges, at the bishop of London&rsquo;s, at Fulham.</p>
<p class="p24">&ldquo;Sir, &mdash; The favour of your letter, with your remarks, can never be enough acknowledged; and the speed with which you discharged so troublesome a task, doubles the obligation.</p>
<p class="p24">&ldquo;I must own, you have pleased me very much by the commendations so ill bestowed upon me; but, I assure you, much more by the frankness of your censure, which I ought to take the more kindly of the two, as it is more advantageous to a scribbler to be improved in his judgment, than to be soothed in his vanity. The greater part of those deviations from the Greek, which you have observed, I was led into by Chapman and Hobbes; who are, it seems, as much celebrated for their knowledge of the original, as they are decried for the badness of their translations. Chapman pretends to have restored the genuine sense of the author, from the mistakes of all former explainers, in several hundred places; and the Cambridge editors of the large Homer, in Greek and Latin, attributed so much to Hobbes, that they confess they have corrected the old Latin interpretation, very often by his version. For my part, I generally took the author&rsquo;s meaning to be as you have explained it; yet their authority, joined to the knowledge of my own imperfectness in the language, overruled me. However, sir, you may be confident I think you in the right, because you happen to be of my opinion: for men (let them say what they will) never approve any other&rsquo;s sense, but as it squares with their own. But you have made me much more proud of, and positive in, my judgment, since it is strengthened by yours. I think your criticisms, which regard the expression, very just, and shall make my profit of them: to give you some proof that I am in earnest, I will alter three verses on your bare objection, though I have Mr. Dryden&rsquo;s example for each of them. And this, I hope, you will account no small piece of obedience, from one, who values the authority of one true poet above that of twenty criticks or commentators. But, though I speak thus of commentators, I will continue to read carefully all I can procure, to make up, that way, for my own want of critical understanding in the original beauties of Homer. Though the greatest of them are certainly those of the invention and design, which are not at all confined to the language: for the distinguishing excellencies of Homer are (by the consent of the best criticks of all nations) first in the manners, (which include all the speeches, as being no other than the representations of each person&rsquo;s manners by his words;) and then in that rapture and fire, which carries you away with him, with that wonderful force, that no man, who has a true poetical spirit, is master of himself, while he reads him. Homer makes you interested and concerned before you are aware, all at once; whereas, Virgil does it by soft degrees. This, I believe, is what a translator of Homer ought, principally, to imitate; and it is very hard for any translator to come up to it, because the chief reason, why all translations fall short of their originals is, that the very constraint they are obliged to, renders them heavy and dispirited.</p>
<p class="p24">&ldquo;The great beauty of Homer&rsquo;s language, as I take it, consists in that noble simplicity which runs through all his works; (and yet his diction, contrary to what one would imagine consistent with simplicity, is, at the same time, very copious.) I don&rsquo;t know how I have run into this pedantry in a letter, but I find I have said too much, as well as spoken too inconsiderately; what farther thoughts I have upon this subject, I shall be glad to communicate to you, for my own improvement, when we meet; which is a happiness I very earnestly desire, as I do likewise some opportunity of proving how much I think myself obliged to your friendship, and how truly I am, sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&ldquo;Your most faithful, humble servant,</p>
<p class="p24">&ldquo;A. Pope.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24"><a id="a1663"></a>The criticism upon Pope&rsquo;s epitaphs, which was printed in the Universal Visiter, is placed here, being too minute and particular to be inserted in the life.</p>
<p class="p24">Every art is best taught by example. Nothing contributes more to the cultivation of propriety, than remarks on the works of those who have most excelled. I shall, therefore, endeavour, at this <span class="t8">visit</span>, to entertain the young students in poetry with an examination of Pope&rsquo;s epitaphs.</p>
<p class="p24">To define an epitaph is useless; every one knows that it is an inscription on a tomb. An epitaph, therefore, implies no particular character of writing, but may be composed in verse or prose. It is, indeed, commonly panegyrical; because we are seldom distinguished with a stone but by our friends; but it has no rule to restrain or modify it, except this, that it ought not to be longer than common beholders may be expected to have leisure and patience to peruse.</p>
<p class="p24">I.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">On</span> Charles, <span class="t8">earl of</span> Dorset, <span class="t8">in the church of Wythyham, in Sussex</span>.</p>
<p class="p26">Dorset, the grace of courts, the muse&rsquo;s pride,<br/>Patron of arts, and judge of nature, dy&rsquo;d, &mdash; <br/>The scourge of pride, though sanctify&rsquo;d or great,<br/>Of fops in learning, and of knaves in state;<br/>Yet soft in nature, though severe his lay,<br/>His anger moral, and his wisdom gay.<br/>Blest satirist! who touch&rsquo;d the mean so true,<br/>As show&rsquo;d, vice had his hate and pity too.<br/>Blest courtier! who could king and country please,<br/>Yet sacred kept his friendship, and his ease.<br/>Blest peer! his great forefather&rsquo;s every grace<br/>Reflecting, and reflected on his race;<br/>Where other Buckhursts, other Dorsets shine,<br/>And patriots still, or poets, deck the line.</p>
<p class="p24">The first distich of this epitaph contains a kind of information which few would want, that the man for whom the tomb was erected, <span class="t8">died</span>. There are, indeed, some qualities worthy of praise ascribed to the dead, but none that were likely to exempt him from the lot of man, or incline us much to wonder that he should die. What is meant by &ldquo;judge of nature,&rdquo; is not easy to say. Nature is not the object of human judgment; for it is vain to judge where we cannot alter. If by nature is meant what is commonly called <span class="t8">nature</span> by the criticks, a just representation of things really existing, and actions really performed, nature cannot be properly opposed to <span class="t8">art</span>; nature being, in this sense, only the best effect of <span class="t8">art</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">The scourge of pride &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">Of this couplet, the second line is not, what is intended, an illustration of the former. <span class="t8">Pride</span> in the <span class="t8">great</span>, is, indeed, well enough connected with <span class="t8">knaves in state</span>, though <span class="t8">knaves</span> is a word rather too ludicrous and light; but the mention of <span class="t8">sanctified</span> pride will not lead the thoughts to <span class="t8">fops in learning</span>, but rather to some species of tyranny or oppression, something more gloomy and more formidable than foppery.</p>
<p class="p24">Yet soft his nature &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24"><a id="a1664"></a>This is a high compliment, but was not first bestowed on Dorset by Pope. The next verse is extremely beautiful.</p>
<p class="p24">Blest satirist!</p>
<p class="p24">In this distich is another line of which Pope was not the author. I do not mean to blame these imitations with much harshness; in long performances they are scarcely to be avoided; and in shorter they may be indulged, because the train of the composition may naturally involve them, or the scantiness of the subject allow little choice. However, what is borrowed is not to be enjoyed as our own; and it is the business of critical justice to give every bird of the muses his proper feather.</p>
<p class="p24">Blest courtier!</p>
<p class="p24">Whether a courtier can properly be commended for keeping his <span class="t8">ease sacred</span>, may, perhaps, be disputable. To please king and country, without sacrificing friendship to any change of times, was a very uncommon instance of prudence or felicity, and deserved to be kept separate from so poor a commendation as care of his ease. I wish our poets would attend a little more accurately to the use of the word <span class="t8">sacred</span>, which surely should never be applied in a serious composition, but where some reference may be made to a higher being, or where some duty is exacted, or implied. A man may keep his friendship sacred, because promises of friendship are very awful ties; but, methinks, he cannot, but in a burlesque sense, be said to keep his ease <span class="t8">sacred</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">Blest peer!</p>
<p class="p24">The blessing ascribed to the <span class="t8">peer</span> has no connexion with his peerage; they might happen to any other man whose ancestors were remembered, or whose posterity are likely to be regarded.</p>
<p class="p24">I know not whether this epitaph be worthy either of the writer or of the man entombed.</p>
<p class="p24">II</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">On sir</span> William Trumbull, one of the principal secretaries of state to king William the third, who, having resigned his place, died in his retirement at Easthamstead, in Berkshire, 1716.</p>
<p class="p26">A pleasing form; a firm, yet cautious mind;<br/>Sincere, though prudent; constant, yet resign&rsquo;d;<br/>Honour unchang&rsquo;d, a principle profest,<br/>Fix&rsquo;d to one side, but mod&rsquo;rate to the rest:<br/>An honest courtier, yet a patriot too;<br/>Just to his prince, and to his country true;<br/>Fill&rsquo;d with the sense of age, the fire of youth,<br/>A scorn of wrangling, yet a zeal for truth;<br/>A gen&rsquo;rous faith, from superstition free;<br/>A love to peace, and hate of tyranny;<br/>Such this man was; who now, from earth remov&rsquo;d,<br/>At length enjoys that liberty he lov&rsquo;d.</p>
<p class="p24">In this epitaph, as in many others, there appears, at the first view, a fault which, I think, scarcely any beauty can compensate. The name is omitted. The end of an epitaph is to convey some account of the dead; and to what purpose is any thing told of him whose name is concealed? An epitaph, and a history of a nameless hero, are equally absurd, since the virtues and qualities so recounted in either are scattered at the mercy of fortune to be appropriated by guess. The name, it is true, may be read upon the stone; but what obligation has it to the poet, whose verses wander over the earth, and leave their subject behind them, and who is forced, like an unskilful painter, to make his purpose known by adventitious help?</p>
<p class="p24">This epitaph is wholly without elevation, and contains nothing striking or particular; but the poet is not to be blamed for the defects of his subject. He said, perhaps, the best that could be said. There are, however, some defects which were not made necessary by the character in which he was employed. There is no opposition between an <span class="t8">honest courtier</span> and a <span class="t8">patriot</span>; for, an <span class="t8">honest courtier</span> cannot but be a <span class="t8">patriot</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">It was unsuitable to the nicety required in short compositions, to close his verse with the word <span class="t8">too</span>: every rhyme should be a word of emphasis; nor can this rule be safely neglected, except where the length of the poem makes slight inaccuracies excusable, or allows room for beauties sufficient to overpower the effects of petty faults.</p>
<p class="p24">At the beginning of the seventh line the word filled is weak and prosaick, having no particular adaptation to any of the words that follow it.</p>
<p class="p24"><a id="a1665"></a>The thought in the last line is impertinent, having no connexion with the foregoing character, nor with the condition of the man described. Had the epitaph been written on the poor conspirator who died lately in prison, after a confinement of more than forty years, without any crime proved against him, the sentiment had been just and pathetical; but why should Trumbull be congratulated upon his liberty, who had never known restraint?</p>
<p class="p24">III.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">On the honourable</span> Simon Harcourt, <span class="t8">only son of the lord chancellor</span> Harcourt, <span class="t8">at the church of Stanton-Harcourt, in Oxfordshire</span>, 1720.</p>
<p class="p26">To this sad shrine, whoe&rsquo;er thou art, draw near,<br/>Here lies the friend most lov&rsquo;d, the son most dear:</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p26">Who ne&rsquo;er knew joy, but friendship might divide,<br/>Or gave his father grief but when he died.<br/>How vain is reason, eloquence how weak!<br/>If Pope must tell what Harcourt cannot speak.<br/>Oh! let thy once-lov&rsquo;d friend inscribe thy stone,<br/>And with a father&rsquo;s sorrows mix his own!</p>
<p class="p24">This epitaph is principally remarkable for the artful introduction of the name, which is inserted with a peculiar felicity, to which chance must concur with genius, which no man can hope to attain twice, and which cannot be copied but with servile imitation.</p>
<p class="p24">I cannot but wish that, of this inscription, the two last lines had been omitted, as they take away from the energy what they do not add to the sense.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.</p>
<p class="p26">ON JAMES CRAGGS, ESQ.<br/><span class="t8">In Westminster Abbey.</span></p>
<p class="p26">JACOBVS CRAGGS,<br/>REGI MAGNÆ BRITANNIAE A SECRETIS<br/>ET CONSILIIS SANCTIORIBVS<br/>PRINCIPIS PARITER AC POPVLI AMOR ET DELICIÆ<br/>VIXIT TITVLIS ET INVIDIA MAJOR,<br/>ANNOS HEV PAVCOS, XXXV.<br/>OB. FEB. XVI. MDCCXX.</p>
<p class="p26">Statesman, yet friend to truth! of soul sincere,<br/>In action faithful, and in honour clear!<br/>Who broke no promise, serv&rsquo;d no private end,<br/>Who gain&rsquo;d no title, and who lost no friend;<br/>Ennobled by himself, by all approv&rsquo;d,<br/>Prais&rsquo;d, wept, and honour&rsquo;d, by the muse he lov&rsquo;d.</p>
<p class="p24">The lines on Craggs were not originally intended for an epitaph; and, therefore, some faults are to be imputed to the violence with which they are torn from the poem that first contained them. We may, however, observe some defects. There is a redundancy of words in the first couplet: it is superfluous to tell of him, who was <span class="t8">sincere, true</span>, and <span class="t8">faithful</span>, that he was <span class="t8">in honour clear</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">There seems to be an opposition intended in the fourth line, which is not very obvious: where is the relation between the two positions, that he <span class="t8">gained no title</span> and <span class="t8">lost no friend</span>?</p>
<p class="p24">It may be proper here to remark the absurdity of joining, in the same inscription, Latin and English, or verse and prose. If either language be preferable to the other, let that only be used; for no reason can be given why part of the information should be given in one tongue, and part in another, on a tomb, more than in any other place, or any other occasion; and to tell all that can be conveniently told in verse, and then to call in the help of prose, has always the appearance of a very artless expedient, or of an attempt unaccomplished. Such an epitaph resembles the conversation of a foreigner, who tells part of his meaning by words, and conveys part by signs.</p>
<p class="p24">V.</p>
<p class="p24">INTENDED FOR MR. ROWE.</p>
<p class="p24"><a id="a1666"></a><span class="t8">In Westminster Abbey</span>.</p>
<p class="p26">Thy reliques, Rowe, to this fair urn we trust,<br/>And, sacred, place by Dryden&rsquo;s awful dust;<br/>Beneath a rude and nameless stone he lies,<br/>To which thy tomb shall guide inquiring eyes.<br/>Peace to thy gentle shade, and endless rest!<br/>Blest in thy genius, in thy love, too, blest!<br/>One grateful woman to thy fame supplies<br/>What a whole thankless land to his denies.</p>
<p class="p24">Of this inscription the chief fault is, that it belongs less to Rowe, for whom it is written, than to Dryden, who was buried near him; and, indeed, gives very little information concerning either.</p>
<p class="p24">To wish &ldquo;Peace to thy shade,&rdquo; is too mythological to be admitted into a Christian temple: the ancient worship has infected almost all our other compositions, and might, therefore, be contented to spare our epitaphs. Let fiction, at least, cease with life, and let us be serious over the grave.</p>
<p class="p24">VI.</p>
<p class="p24">ON MRS. CORBET,</p>
<p class="p24"><a id="a1667"></a><span class="t8">Who died of a cancer in her breast</span>.</p>
<p class="p26">Here rests a woman, good without pretence,<br/>Blest with plain reason, and with sober sense:<br/>No conquest she, but o&rsquo;er herself, desir&rsquo;d;<br/>No arts essay&rsquo;d, but not to be admir&rsquo;d.<br/>Passion and pride were to her soul unknown,<br/>Convinc&rsquo;d that virtue only is our own.<br/>So unaffected, so compos&rsquo;d a mind,<br/>So firm, yet soft, so strong, yet so refin&rsquo;d,<br/>Heav&rsquo;n, as its purest gold, by tortures try&rsquo;d;<br/>The saint sustain&rsquo;d it, but the woman dy&rsquo;d.</p>
<p class="p24">I have always considered this as the most valuable of all Pope&rsquo;s epitaphs; the subject of it is a character not discriminated by any shining or eminent peculiarities; yet that which really makes though not the splendour, the felicity of life, and that which every wise man will choose for his final and lasting companion in the languor of age, in the quiet of privacy, when he departs weary and disgusted from the ostentatious, the volatile, and the vain. Of such a character, which the dull overlook, and the gay despise, it was fit that the value should be made known, and the dignity established. Domestick virtue, as it is exerted without great occasions, or conspicuous consequences, in an even unnoted tenour, required the genius of Pope to display it in such a manner as might attract regard, and enforce reverence. Who can forbear to lament that this amiable woman has no name in the verses?</p>
<p class="p24">If the particular lines of this inscription be examined, it will appear less faulty than the rest. There is scarcely one line taken from commonplaces, unless it be that in which <span class="t8">only virtue</span> is said to be our own. I once heard a Jady of great beauty and excellence object to the fourth line, that it contained an unnatural and incredible panegyrick. Of this let the ladies judge.</p>
<p class="p24">VII.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">On the monument of the honourable</span> Robert Digby, <span class="t8">and of his sister</span> Mary, <span class="t8">erected by their father the lord</span> Digby, <span class="t8">in the church of Skerborne, in Dorsetshire, 1727.</span></p>
<p class="p26">Go! fair example of untainted youth,<br/>Of modest wisdom, and pacific truth:<br/>Compos&rsquo;d in sufferings, and in joy sedate,<br/>Good without noise, without pretension great.<br/>Just of thy word, in ev&rsquo;ry thought sincere,<br/>Who knew no wish but what the world might hear:<br/>Of softest manners, unaffected mind,<br/>Lover of peace, and friend of human kind:<br/>Go, live! for heav&rsquo;n&rsquo;s eternal year is thine;<br/>Go, and exalt thy mortal to divine.<br/>And thou, blest maid! attendant on his doom,<br/>Pensive hast follow&rsquo;d to the silent tomb,<br/>Steer&rsquo;d the same course to the same quiet shore,<br/>Not parted long, and now to part no more!<br/>Go, then, where only bliss sincere is known!<br/>Go, where to love and to enjoy are one!<br/>Yet take these tears, mortality&rsquo;s relief,<br/>And, till we share your joys, forgive our grief:<br/>These little rites, a stone, a verse receive,<br/>&rsquo;Tis all a father, all a friend can give!</p>
<p class="p24">This epitaph contains of the brother only a general indiscriminate character, and of the sister tells nothing but that she died. The difficulty in writing epitaphs is to give a particular and appropriate praise. This, however, is not always to be performed, whatever be the diligence or ability of the writer; for, the greater part of mankind <span class="t8">have no character at all</span>, have little that distinguishes them from others equally good or bad, and, therefore, nothing can be said of them which may not be applied with equal propriety to a thousand more. It is, indeed, no great panegyrick, that there is inclosed in this tomb one who was born in one year, and died in another; yet many useful and amiable lives have been spent, which yet leave little materials for any other memorial. These are, however, not the proper subjects of poetry; and whenever friendship, or any other motive, obliges a poet to write on such subjects, he must be forgiven if he sometimes wanders in generalities, and utters the same praises over different tombs.</p>
<p class="p24">The scantiness of human praises can scarcely be made more apparent, than by remarking how often Pope has, in the few epitaphs which he composed, found it necessary to borrow from himself. The fourteen epitaphs, which he has written, comprise about a hundred and forty lines, in which there are more repetitions than will easily be found in all the rest of his works. In the eight lines which make the character of Digby, there is scarce any thought, or word, which may not be found in the other epitaphs.</p>
<p class="p24">The ninth line, which is far the strongest and most elegant, is borrowed from Dryden. The conclusion is the same with that on Harcourt, but is here more elegant and better connected.</p>
<p class="p24">VIII.</p>
<p class="p26">ON SIR GODFREY KNELLER.<br/><span class="t8">In Westminster Abbey, 1723.</span></p>
<p class="p26">Kneller, by heav&rsquo;n, and not a master, taught,<br/>Whose art was nature, and whose pictures thought;<br/>Now for two ages, having snatch&rsquo;d from fate<br/>Whate&rsquo;er was beauteous, or whate&rsquo;er was great,<br/>Lies crown&rsquo;d with princes&rsquo; honours, poets&rsquo; lays,<br/>Due to his merit, and brave thirst of praise.<br/>Living, great nature fear&rsquo;d he might outvie<br/>Her works; and dying, fears herself may die.</p>
<p class="p24">Of this epitaph the first couplet is good, the second not bad, the third is deformed with a broken metaphor, the word <span class="t8">crowned</span> not being applicable to the <span class="t8">honours</span> or the <span class="t8">lays</span>; and the fourth is not only borrowed from the epitaph on Raphael, but of very harsh construction.</p>
<p class="p24">IX.</p>
<p class="p24">ON GENERAL HENRY WITHERS. <span class="t8">In Westminster Abbey</span>, 1723.</p>
<p class="p24">Here, Withers, rest! thou bravest, gentlest mind, Thy country&rsquo;s friend, but more of human kind. O! born to arms! O! worth in youth approv&rsquo;d! O! soft humanity in age belov&rsquo;d! For thee the hardy vet&rsquo;ran drops a tear, And the gay courtier feels the sigh sincere.</p>
<p class="p24">Withers, adieu! yet not with thee remove Thy martial spirit, or thy social love! Amidst corruption, luxury and rage, Still leave some ancient virtues to our age: Nor let us say (those English glories gone) The last true Briton lies beneath this stone.</p>
<p class="p24">The epitaph on Withers affords another instance of commonplaces, though somewhat diversified, by mingled qualities, and the peculiarity of a profession.</p>
<p class="p24">The second couplet is abrupt, general, and unpleasing; exclamation seldom succeeds in our language; and, I think, it may be observed, that the particle O! used at the beginning of a sentence, always offends.</p>
<p class="p24"><a id="a1668"></a>The third couplet is more happy; the value expressed for him, by different sorts of men, raises him to esteem; there is yet something of the common cant of superficial satirists, who suppose that the insincerity of a courtier destroys all his sensations, and that he is equally a dissembler to the living and the dead.</p>
<p class="p24">At the third couplet I should wish the epitaph to close, but that I should be unwilling to lose the two next lines, which yet are dearly bought if they cannot be retained without the four that follow them.</p>
<p class="p24">X.</p>
<p class="p27">ON MR. ELIJAH FENTON.</p>
<p class="p27"><span class="t8">At Easthamstead, in Berkshire, 1730.</span></p>
<p class="p26">This modest stone, what few vain marbles can,<br/>May truly say, here lies an honest man:<br/>A poet, blest beyond the poet&rsquo;s fate,<br/>Whom heav&rsquo;n kept sacred from the proud and great:<br/>Foe to loud praise, and friend to learned ease,<br/>Content with science in the vale of peace.<br/>Calmly he look&rsquo;d on either life, and here<br/>Saw nothing to regret, or there to fear;<br/>From nature&rsquo;s temp&rsquo;rate feast rose satisfy&rsquo;d,<br/>Thank&rsquo;d heav&rsquo;n that he liv&rsquo;d, and that he dy&rsquo;d.</p>
<p class="p24">The first couplet of this epitaph is borrowed from Crashaw. The four next lines contain a species of praise, peculiar, original, and just. Here, therefore, the inscription should have ended, the latter part containing nothing but what is common to every man who is wise and good. The character of Fenton was so amiable, that I cannot forbear to wish for some poet or biographer to display it more fully for the advantage of posterity. If he did not stand in the first rank of genius, he may claim a place in the second; and, whatever criticism may object to his writings, censure could find very little to blame in his life.</p>
<p class="p24">XI.</p>
<p class="p27">ON MR. GAY.</p>
<p class="p27"><span class="t8">In Westminster Abbey, 1732.</span></p>
<p class="p26"><a id="a1669"></a>Of manners gentle, of affections mild;<br/>In wit, a man; simpicity, a child;<br/>With native humour temp&rsquo;ring virtuous rage,<br/>Form&rsquo;d to delight at once and lash the age;<br/>Above temptation, in a low estate;<br/>359 And uncorrupted e&rsquo;en among the great:<br/>A safe companion and an easy friend,<br/>Unblam&rsquo;d through life, lamented in thy end;<br/>These are thy honours! not that here thy bust<br/>Is mix&rsquo;d with heroes, or with kings thy dust;<br/>But that the worthy and the good shall say,<br/>Striking their pensive bosoms &mdash; Here lies Gay!</p>
<p class="p24">As Gay was the favourite of our author, this epitaph was probably written with an uncommon degree of attention; yet it is not more successfully executed than the rest, for it will not always happen that the success of a poet is proportionate to his labour. The same observation may be extended to all works of imagination, which are often influenced by causes wholly out of the performer&rsquo;s power, by hints of which he perceives not the origin, by sudden elevations of mind which he cannot produce in himself, and which sometimes rise when he expects them least.</p>
<p class="p24">The two parts of the first line are only echoes of each other; <span class="t8">gentle manners</span> and <span class="t8">mild affections</span>, if they mean any thing, must mean the same.</p>
<p class="p24">That Gay was a <span class="t8">man in wit</span> is a very frigid commendation; to have the wit of a man, is not much for a poet. The <a id="a1670"></a><span class="t8">wit of a man</span>, and the <span class="t8">simplicity of a child</span>, make a poor and vulgar contrast, and raise no ideas of excellence, either intellectual or moral.</p>
<p class="p24">In the next couplet <span class="t8">rage</span> is less properly introduced after the mention of <span class="t8">mildness</span> and <span class="t8">gentleness</span> which are made the constituents of his character; for a man so <span class="t8">mild</span> and <span class="t8">gentle</span> to <span class="t8">temper</span> his <span class="t8">rage</span>, was not difficult.</p>
<p class="p24">The next line is inharmonious in its sound, and mean in its conception; the opposition is obvious, and the word <span class="t8">lash</span> used absolutely, and without any modification, is gross and improper.</p>
<p class="p24">To be <span class="t8">above temptation</span> in poverty, and <span class="t8">free from corruption among the great</span>, is, indeed, such a peculiarity as deserved notice. But to be a <span class="t8">safe companion</span> is praise merely negative, arising not from the possession of virtue, but the absence of vice, and one of the most odious.</p>
<p class="p24">As little can be added to his character, by asserting that he was <span class="t8">lamented in his end</span>. Every man that dies is, at least, by the writer of his epitaph, supposed to be lamented; and, therefore, this general lamentation does no honour to Gay.</p>
<p class="p24">The first eight lines have no grammar; the adjectives are without any substantive, and the epithets without a subject.</p>
<p class="p24">The thought in the last line, that Gay is buried in the bosoms of the <span class="t8">worthy</span> and the <span class="t8">good</span><a id="a1671"></a>, who are distinguished only to lengthen the line, is so dark that few understand it; and so harsh, when it is explained, that still fewer approve.</p>
<p class="p24">XII.</p>
<p class="p24">INTENDED FOR SIR ISAAC NEWTON.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">In Westminster Abbey</span>.</p>
<p class="p26">ISAACUS NEWTONIUS:<br/>Quem immortalem<br/>Testantur, <span class="t8">tempus, natura, cœlum</span>:<br/>Mortalem<br/>Hoc marmor fatetur.<br/>Nature, and nature&rsquo;s law, lay hid in night:<br/>God said, <span class="t8">Let Newton be</span>! And all was light.</p>
<p class="p24">Of this epitaph, short as it is, the faults seem not to be very few. Why part should be Latin, and part English, it is not easy to discover. In the Latin the opposition of <span class="t8">immortalis</span> and <span class="t8">mortalis</span>, is a mere sound, or a mere quibble; he is not <span class="t8">immortal</span> in any sense contrary to that in which he is <span class="t8">mortal</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">In the verses the thought is obvious, and the words <span class="t8">night</span> and <span class="t8">light</span> are too nearly allied.</p>
<p class="p24">XIII.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">On</span> Edmund <span class="t8">duke of</span> Buckingham, <span class="t8">who died in the nineteenth year of his age</span>, 1735.</p>
<p class="p26">If modest youth, with cool reflection crown&rsquo;d,<br/>And ev&rsquo;ry op&rsquo;ning virtue blooming round,<br/>Could save a parent&rsquo;s justest pride from fate,<br/>Or add one patriot to a sinking state;<br/>This weeping marble had not ask&rsquo;d thy tear,<br/>Or sadly told how many hopes lie here!<br/>The living virtue now had shone approv&rsquo;d,<br/>The senate heard him, and his country lov&rsquo;d.<br/>Yet softer honours, and less noisy fame,<br/>Attend the shade of gentle Buckingham:<br/>In whom a race, for courage fam&rsquo;d and art,<br/>Ends in the milder merit of the heart:<br/>And, chiefs or sages long to Britain giv&rsquo;n,<br/>Pays the last tribute of a saint to heav&rsquo;n.</p>
<p class="p24">This epitaph Mr. Warburton prefers to the rest; but I know not for what reason. To <span class="t8">crown</span> with <span class="t8">reflection</span> is surely a mode of speech approaching to nonsense. <span class="t8">Opening virtues blooming round,</span> is something like tautology; the six following lines are poor and prosaick <span class="t8">Art</span> is, in another couplet, used for <span class="t8">arts</span>, that a rhyme may be had to <span class="t8">heart.</span> The six last lines are the best, but not excellent.</p>
<p class="p24">The rest of his sepulchral performances hardly deserve the notice of criticism. The contemptible Dialogue between He and She should have been suppressed for the author&rsquo;s sake.</p>
<p class="p24">In his last epitaph on himself, in which he attempts to be jocular upon one of the few things that make wise men serious, he confounds the living man with the dead:</p>
<p class="p26">Under this stone, or under this sill,<br/>Or under this turf, &amp;c.</p>
<p class="p24">When a man is once buried, the question, under what he is buried, is easily decided. He forgot that though he wrote the epitaph in a state of uncertainty, yet it could not be laid over him till his grave was made. Such is the folly of wit when it is ill employed.</p>
<p class="p24">The world has but little new; even this wretchedness seems to have been borrowed from the following tuneless lines:</p>
<p class="p26">Ludovici Areosti humantur ossa<br/>Sub hoc marmore, vel sub hac humo, seu<br/>Sub quicquid voluit benignus hæres,<br/>Sive hærede benignior comes, seu<br/>Opportunius incidens viator;<br/>Nam scire haud potuit futura, sed nec<br/>Tanti erat vacuum sibi cadaver<br/>Ut urnam cuperet parare vivens;<br/>Vivens ista tamen sibi paravit,<br/>Quæ inscribi voluit suo sepulchro<br/>Olim siquod haberet is sepulchrum.</p>
<p class="p24">Surely Ariosto did not venture to expect that his trifle would have ever had such an illustrious imitator.</p>
