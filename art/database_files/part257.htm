(2017)] is a popular textbook on computer architecture, which in- cludes coverage of hardware aspects of translation look-aside buﬀers, caches, and memory-management units.</p><p style="padding-left: 119pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">The storage structure of speciﬁc database systems, such as IBM DB2, Oracle, Mi- crosoft SQL Server, and PostgreSQL are documented in their respective system man- uals, which are available online.</p><p style="padding-left: 119pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">Algorithms for buﬀer management in database systems, along with a performance evaluation, were presented by [Chou and Dewitt (1985)]. Buﬀer management in op- erating systems is discussed in most operating-system texts, including in [Silberschatz et al. (2018)].</p><p style="padding-left: 119pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">[Abadi et al. (2008)] presents a comparison of column-oriented and row-oriented storage, including issues related to query processing and optimization.</p><p style="padding-left: 119pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">Sybase IQ, developed in the mid 1990s, was the ﬁrst commercially successful column-oriented database, designed for analytics. MonetDB and C-Store were column- oriented databases developed as academic research projects. The Vertica column- oriented database is a commercial database that grew out of C-Store, while VectorWise is a commercial database that grew out of MonetDB. As its name suggests, VectorWise supports vector processing of data, and as a result supports very high processing rates for many analytical queries. [Stonebraker et al. (2005)] describe C-Store, while [Idreos et al. (2012)] give an overview of the MonetDB project and [Zukowski et al. (2012)] describes Vectorwise.</p><p style="padding-left: 119pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">The <span class="s44">ORC </span>and Parquet columnar ﬁle formats were developed to support compressed storage of data for big-data applications that run on the Apache Hadoop platform.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part256.htm">&lt; 上一个</a><span> | </span><a href="../database.html">内容</a><span> | </span><a href="part258.htm">下一个 &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
