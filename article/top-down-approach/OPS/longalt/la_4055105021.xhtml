In the first row, we see a total of nine boxes shaded light blue. The first box is labeled "PDU type (0-3)." The next three boxes are designated "Get/set header," and are labeled (from left to right): "Request ID," "Error Status (0-5)," and "Error Index." The last five boxes are designated "Variables to get/set," and are labeled (left to right): "Name," "Value," "Name," "Value." This is followed by an ellipsis and an unlabeled box, suggesting that the chain is indefinite.</p><p id="P700101195200000000000000000AE2C" data-uri="M05_KURO4140_07_SE_C05.xhtml#P700101195200000000000000000AE2C">The entire bottom row of boxes, nine in total, is designated "SNMP PDU."
