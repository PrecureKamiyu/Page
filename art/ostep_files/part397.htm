Each of these approaches has different characteristics which are worth evaluating, in order to understand their strengths and weaknesses.</p><p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Specifically, we will evaluate each RAID design along three axes. The first axis is <b>capacity</b>; given a set of N disks, how much useful capacity is available to systems that use the RAID? Without redundancy, the answer is obviously N; however, if we have a system that keeps a two copies of each block, we will obtain a useful capacity of N/2. Different schemes (e.g., parity-based ones) tend to fall in between.</p><p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">The second axis of evaluation is <b>reliability</b>. How many disk faults can the given design tolerate? In alignment with our fault model, we assume only that an entire disk can fail; in later chapters (i.e., on data integrity), we’ll think about how to handle more complex failure modes.</p><p style="padding-left: 52pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: justify;">Finally, the third axis is <b>performance</b>. Performance is somewhat chal-</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 68pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">lenging to evaluate, because it depends heavily on the workload pre- sented to the disk array. Thus, before evaluating performance, we will first present a set of typical workloads that one should consider.</p><p style="padding-left: 68pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">We now consider three important RAID designs: RAID Level 0 (strip- ing), RAID Level 1 (mirroring), and RAID Levels 4/5 (parity-based re- dundancy). The naming of each of these designs as a “level” stems from the pioneering work of Patterson, Gibson, and Katz at Berkeley [P+88].</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part396.htm">&lt; 上一个</a><span> | </span><a href="../ostep.html">内容</a><span> | </span><a href="part398.htm">下一个 &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
