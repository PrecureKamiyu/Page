<p class="p21">This famous 1775 pamphlet was a defence of the Coercive Acts and a response to the Declaration of Rights of the First Continental Congress of America, which protested against taxation without representation. Johnson argued that in emigrating to America, colonists had &ldquo;voluntarily resigned the power of voting&rdquo;, but they still had &ldquo;virtual representation&rdquo; in Parliament. In a parody of the Declaration of Rights, Johnson suggested that the Americans had no more right to govern themselves than the Cornish people, and asked, &ldquo;How is it that we hear the loudest yelps for liberty among the drivers of negroes?&rdquo; If the Americans wanted to participate in Parliament, argues Johnson, they should move to England and purchase an estate. Johnson denounced English supporters of American separatists as &ldquo;traitors to this country&rdquo;, and hoped that the matter would be settled without bloodshed, but that it would end with English superiority and American obedience. </p>
<p class="p22">After the signing of the 1783 Peace of Paris treaties, marking the defeat of the British, Johnson was said to be &ldquo;deeply disturbed&rdquo; with the &ldquo;state of this kingdom&rdquo;.</p>
