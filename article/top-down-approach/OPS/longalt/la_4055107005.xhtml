The sender's process is divided by vertical lines into segments-the first three of which are highlighted in blue-with the first segment (moving left to right) labeled "Time slot 1." Time slot 1 is further organized into two rows, with "Data bits" appearing on top and "Code" appearing on bottom. The data bits appear in a gray rectangle that spans from one end of time slot 1 to the other, and which is labeled "d1 = -1." The code appears as a series of slots arranged on a horizontal line, with slots above the line labeled "1" and slots below the line labeled "-1." Here, the slots are: 1, 1, 1, -1, 1, -1, -1, -1. The next segment is labeled "Time slot 0." The data bits are labeled "d0 = 1" and the code is given as 1, 1, 1, -1, 1, -1, -1, -1. In the third segment, blue arrows point from the code and the data bits to a circle, which is labeled "Zi,m= dio cm. The next two segments are jointly designated "Channel output Zi,m." The first of these is labeled "Time slot 1 channel output," and contains the following code: -1, -1, -1, 1, -1, 1, 1, 1. The next is labeled "Time slot 0 channel output," and continues the line code with: 1, 1, 1, -1, 1, -1, -1, -1. And arrow extends from this point downward and to the left and to the beginning of the receiver's process, which is organized in a similar manner as the sender's. Similarly, the first three segments (moving left to right) are highlighted in blue.</p><p id="P700101195200000000000000000B313" data-uri="M07_KURO4140_07_SE_C07.xhtml#P700101195200000000000000000B313">The first segment is labeled "Time slot 1 received input." Rather than data bits, there are two lines of code. The top line appears as: -1, -1, -1, 1, -1, 1, 1, 1. The bottom line of code appears as: 1, 1, 1, -1, 1, -1, -1, -1. The second segment is labeled "Time slot 0 received input" and continues both lines of code. Top: 1, 1, 1, -1, 1, -1, -1, -1. Bottom: 1, 1, 1, -1, 1, -1, -1, -1. In the third segment, blue arrows point from these lines of code to a circle, which is labeled "di = M?(Sigma) Zi,m o cm over M." The next segment includes the data bits "d1 = -1" and the last segment includes the data bits "d0 = 1."</p></div></section></body></html>
