<h2 class="h20"><a id="a1337"></a><a id="a1336"></a><a id="a1338"></a>G</h2>
<p class="p32"><span class="t25">G</span> has two sounds, one from the Greek Γ, and the Latin, which is called that of the hard <span class="t8">G</span>, because it is formed by a pressure somewhat hard of the forepart of the tongue against the upper gum. This sound <span class="t8">G</span> retains before <span class="t8">a, o, u, l, r;</span> as, <span class="t8">gate, go, gull.</span> The other sound, called that of the soft <span class="t8">G</span>, resembles that of <span class="t8">J</span>, and is commonly, though not always, found before <span class="t8">e, i;</span> as, <span class="t8">gem, gibbet</span>. Before <span class="t8">u</span>, at the end of a word, <span class="t8">g</span> is commonly melted away; as in the French, from which these words are commonly derived: thus, for <span class="t8">benign, malign, condign,</span> we pronounce <span class="t8">benine, maline, condine</span>. It is often silent in the middle of words before <span class="t8">h</span>; as, <span class="t8">might</span>. The Saxon G, ʒ, seems to have had generally the sound <span class="t8">y</span> consonant; whence <span class="t8">gate</span> is by rusticks still pronounced <span class="t8">yate</span>.</p>

<p class="p32">Not to know what we speak one to another, so we seem to know, is to know straight our purpose: chough&rsquo;s language, <span class="t8">gabble</span> enough, and good enough. <span class="t8">Shak. All&rsquo;s well that ends well.</span></p>
<p class="p32">2. Loud talk without meaning.</p>
