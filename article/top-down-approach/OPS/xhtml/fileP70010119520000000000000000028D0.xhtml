Unlike the wireless host and wireless link, a base station has no obvious counterpart in a wired network. A base station is responsible for sending and receiving data (e.g., packets) to and from a wireless host that is associated with that base station. A base station will often be responsible for coordinating the transmission of multiple wireless hosts with which it is associated. When we say a wireless host is “associated” with a base station, we mean that (1) the host is within the wireless communication distance of the base station, and (2) the host uses that base station to relay data between it (the host) and the larger network. <span class="keyword" id="P70010119520000000000000000028F2" data-uri="M07_KURO4140_07_SE_C07.xhtml#P70010119520000000000000000028F2"><b>Cell towers</b></span> in cellular networks and <span class="keyword" id="P70010119520000000000000000028F3" data-uri="M07_KURO4140_07_SE_C07.xhtml#P70010119520000000000000000028F3"><b>access points</b></span> in 802.11 wireless LANs are examples of base stations.</p>

Most college campuses offer ubiquitous wireless access, and it’s hard to find a hotel that doesn’t offer wireless Internet access.</p>
<p id="P700101195200000000000000000B2D9" data-uri="M07_KURO4140_07_SE_C07.xhtml#P700101195200000000000000000B2D9">Over the past decade a number of cities have designed, deployed, and operated municipal WiFi networks. The vision of providing ubiquitous WiFi access to the community as a public service (much like streetlights)—helping to bridge the digital divide by providing Internet access to all citizens and to promote economic development—is compelling. Many cities around the world, including Philadelphia, Toronto, Hong Kong, Minneapolis, London, and Auckland, have plans to provide ubiquitous wireless within the city, or have already done so to varying degrees. The goal in Philadelphia was to “turn Philadelphia into the nation’s largest WiFi hotspot and help to improve education, bridge the digital divide, enhance neighborhood development, and reduce the costs of government.” The ambitious program—an agreement between the city, Wireless Philadelphia (a nonprofit entity), and the Internet Service Provider Earthlink—built an operational network of 802.11b hotspots on streetlamp pole arms and traffic control devices that covered 80 percent of the city. But financial and operational concerns caused the network to be sold to a group of private investors in 2008, who later sold the network back to the city in 2010. Other cities, such as Minneapolis, Toronto, Hong Kong, and Auckland, have had success with smaller-scale efforts.</p>

However, 802.11 access points (see <a class="xref" href="fileP700101195200000000000000000296A.xhtml#P700101195200000000000000000296A" data-foobar="7"><span class="label">Section</span> <span class="number">7.3</span></a>) have much shorter ranges than 4G cellular base stations (see <a class="xref" href="fileP7001011952000000000000000002A76.xhtml#P7001011952000000000000000002A76" data-foobar="7"><span class="label">Section</span> <span class="number">7.4</span></a>), requiring a larger number of deployed endpoints to cover the same geographic region. Cellular data networks providing Internet access, on the other hand, operate in the licensed spectrum. Cellular providers pay billions of dollars for spectrum access rights for their networks, making cellular data networks a business rather than municipal undertaking.</p>

Furthermore, all communication is between this base station and a wireless host over a single wireless hop. The 802.11 networks you use in the classroom, café, or library; and the 4G LTE data networks that we will learn about shortly all fall in this category. The vast majority of our daily interactions are with single-hop, infrastructure-based ­wireless networks.</p></li>
