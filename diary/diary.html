<h1>Jun 24</h1>
<p>EVA. Come and watch eva!</p>

<h1>Jun 23</h1>
<p>I just broke up with gf. The relationship last for just two months. Crap. Maybe it is because the summer has come; the spring has passed. But she is in winter right now. What the fuck does that have to do with the season? We are not even in the same season. Fucker.</p>
<p>I should talk to someone about it. I don't know. I am feeling worse. I don't know how she feels. Maybe she just let out a sigh and felt so relieved. The relationship is a burden to her, that is what I have perceived. But what about me? I don't feel good.</p>
<p>Why not try caring about how I feel? I am (at least I think I am) a disabled, mentally, I guess. My life is incomplete. I have no friend. I don't enjoy games. I don't do well in school. I barely talk to my parents. I don't talk to my brother. I don't have a friendship with my roommates. I don't learn what I want to learn. I don't do thing that I like to do. I find no fun in my life. I hardly express my feeling. I don't feel like being a human. I feel so disabled. I am so disabled.</p>
<p>Gosh. At least for one time, I have something that is complete, that completes me (at least my life). Maybe she doesn't know how I feel. I feel terrible. It just because I pretend the thing I dislike does not exists that I can live my day.</p>
<p>What does relationship or koi mean to people? I think that is the question right now. A relationship means the future, means the life of a couple or it means a couple running a marriage for dozens of years.</p>
<p>But to me, it is just a chance to be normal people. To be a human! What the fuck are humans? I don't fucking know.</p>
<p>I just don't know.</p>
<p>Why don't you just fucking save me?</p>
<p>I can't do anything. I don't have confidence. So why can't you just care more about me instead of the fucking future?</p>
<p>When I was thinking "at least, I have another reason (a good reason) not to kill myself", I wasn't thinking about future. I can't think about the future. What am I supposed to do when I think about the future, if I can't do anything?</p>
<p>How did I know if I could do anything? What if the truth is "I think I can't do anything" but not "I can't anything"? Idk man. I am disabled. Why are you expecting such things from a disabled. And you just leave me alone, leave a disabled alone?</p>
<p>Sucks</p>


<h1>May 13</h1>
<p>What should be contained in the diary? I don't know. But I think that one takes diary to
    write thing that happened in that day. It is indeed useless to just write down things so daily.
    Does meaning just emerge from such behavior?</p>

<h2>Ways to Learn</h2>
<p>Things get easy if you want to read great books. As for me, I would like to get a perspective into the
    subject, after which further reading is done. The pattern suits for me because reading books may seem so
    difficult for me if I am not familiar with the subject.</p>

<h2>Books</h2>
<p>I went to a book store. But the most interesting book I found is <em>Introduction to random process with
    application</em> by Sheldon Ross, which also was priced at <b>179</b> rmb. I can't afford it.</p>
<p>And I also found that the typesetting of the book sucks.</p>

<h2>Sex and Power and Pegging</h2>
<p>The relationship of <em>sex</em> and <em>power</em> is so intriguing. Do you know pegging? I think pegging is
    the very thing that reflects the relationship of sex and power. One (a woman) is thirsty for this reversion
    of the power which, in some people's view is the just the rebel against power. However, this exact behavior
    reflects that everyone is so constrained by the power.</p>

<h2>E-books</h2>
<p>Reading e-books can be suffering. Devices are important. But I can't afford a good device.</p>
