<body>
<h2 class="h20"><a id="a2487"></a>CHAPTER IV. JOHNSON AS A LITERARY DICTATOR.</h2>
<p class="p21">We have now reached the point at which Johnson&rsquo;s life becomes distinctly visible through the eyes of a competent observer. The last twenty years are those which are really familiar to us; and little remains but to give some brief selection of Boswell&rsquo;s anecdotes. The task, however, is a difficult one. It is easy enough to make a selection of the gems of Boswell&rsquo;s narrative; but it is also inevitable that, taken from their setting, they should lose the greatest part of their brilliance. We lose all the quaint semiconscious touches of character which make the original so fascinating; and Boswell&rsquo;s absurdities become less amusing when we are able to forget for an instant that the perpetrator is also the narrator. The effort, however, must be made; and it will be best to premise a brief statement of the external conditions of the life.</p>
<p class="p24">From the time of the pension until his death, Johnson was elevated above the fear of poverty. He had a pleasant refuge at the Thrales&rsquo;, where much of his time was spent; and many friends gathered round him and regarded his utterances with even excessive admiration. He had still frequent periods of profound depression. His diaries reveal an inner life tormented by gloomy forebodings, by remorse for past indolence and futile resolutions of amendment; but he could always escape from himself to a society of friends and admirers. His abandonment of wine seems to have improved his health and diminished the intensity of his melancholy fits. His literary activity, however, nearly ceased. He wrote a few political pamphlets in defence of Government, and after a long period of indolence managed to complete his last conspicuous work &mdash; the <span class="t8">Lives of the Poets</span>, which was published in 1779 and 1781. One other book of some interest appeared in 1775. It was an account of the journey made with Boswell to the Hebrides in 1773. This journey was in fact the chief interruption to the even tenour of his life. He made a tour to Wales with the Thrales in 1774; and spent a month with them in Paris in 1775. For the rest of the period he lived chiefly in London or at Streatham, making occasional trips to Lichfield and Oxford, or paying visits to Taylor, Langton, and one or two other friends. It was, however, in the London which he loved so ardently (&ldquo;a man,&rdquo; he said once, &ldquo;who is tired of London is tired of life&rdquo;), that he was chiefly conspicuous. There he talked and drank tea illimitably at his friends&rsquo; houses, or argued and laid down the law to his disciples collected in a tavern instead of Academic groves. Especially he was in all his glory at the Club, which began its meetings in February, 1764, and was afterwards known as the Literary Club. This Club was founded by Sir Joshua Reynolds, &ldquo;our Romulus,&rdquo; as Johnson called him. The original members were Reynolds, Johnson, Burke, Nugent, Beauclerk, Langton, Goldsmith, Chamier, and Hawkins. They met weekly at the Turk&rsquo;s Head, in Gerard Street, Soho, at seven o&rsquo;clock, and the talk generally continued till a late hour. The Club was afterwards increased in numbers, and the weekly supper changed to a fortnightly dinner. It continued to thrive, and election to it came to be as great an honour in certain circles as election to a membership of Parliament. Among the members elected in Johnson&rsquo;s lifetime were Percy of the <span class="t8">Reliques</span>, Garrick, Sir W. Jones, Boswell, Fox, Steevens, Gibbon, Adam Smith, the Wartons, Sheridan, Dunning, Sir Joseph Banks, Windham, Lord Stowell, Malone, and Dr. Burney. What was best in the conversation at the time was doubtless to be found at its meetings.</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson&rsquo;s habitual mode of life is described by Dr. Maxwell, one of Boswell&rsquo;s friends, who made his acquaintance in 1754. Maxwell generally called upon him about twelve, and found him in bed or declaiming over his tea. A levée, chiefly of literary men, surrounded him; and he seemed to be regarded as a kind of oracle to whom every one might resort for advice or instruction. After talking all the morning, he dined at a tavern, staying late and then going to some friend&rsquo;s house for tea, over which he again loitered for a long time. Maxwell is puzzled to know when he could have read or written. The answer seems to be pretty obvious; namely, that after the publication of the <span class="t8">Dictionary</span> he wrote very little, and that, when he did write, it was generally in a brief spasm of feverish energy. One may understand that Johnson should have frequently reproached himself for his indolence; though he seems to have occasionally comforted himself by thinking that he could do good by talking as well as by writing. He said that a man should have a part of his life to himself; and compared himself to a physician retired to a small town from practice in a great city. Boswell, in spite of this, said that he still wondered that Johnson had not more pleasure in writing than in not writing. &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; replied the oracle, &ldquo;you <span class="t8">may</span> wonder.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I will now endeavour, with Boswell&rsquo;s guidance, to describe a few of the characteristic scenes which can be fully enjoyed in his pages alone. The first must be the introduction of Boswell to the sage. Boswell had come to London eager for the acquaintance of literary magnates. He already knew Goldsmith, who had inflamed his desire for an introduction to Johnson. Once when Boswell spoke of Levett, one of Johnson&rsquo;s dependents, Goldsmith had said, &ldquo;he is poor and honest, which is recommendation enough to Johnson.&rdquo; Another time, when Boswell had wondered at Johnson&rsquo;s kindness to a man of bad character, Goldsmith had replied, &ldquo;He is now become miserable, and that insures the protection of Johnson.&rdquo; Boswell had hoped for an introduction through the elder Sheridan; but Sheridan never forgot the contemptuous phrase in which Johnson had referred to his fellow-pensioner. Possibly Sheridan had heard of one other Johnsonian remark. &ldquo;Why, sir,&rdquo; he had said, &ldquo;Sherry is dull, naturally dull; but it must have taken him a great deal of pains to become what we now see him. Such an excess of stupidity, sir, is not in Nature.&rdquo; At another time he said, &ldquo;Sheridan cannot bear me; I bring his declamation to a point.&rdquo; &ldquo;What influence can Mr. Sheridan have upon the language of this great country by his narrow exertions? Sir, it is burning a farthing candle at Dover to show light at Calais.&rdquo; Boswell, however, was acquainted with Davies, an actor turned bookseller, now chiefly remembered by a line in Churchill&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Rosciad</span> which is said to have driven him from the stage &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">He mouths a sentence as curs mouth a bone.</p>
<p class="p24">Boswell was drinking tea with Davies and his wife in their back parlour when Johnson came into the shop. Davies, seeing him through the glass-door, announced his approach to Boswell in the spirit of Horatio addressing Hamlet: &ldquo;Look, my Lord, it comes!&rdquo; Davies introduced the young Scotchman, who remembered Johnson&rsquo;s proverbial prejudices. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell him where I come from!&rdquo; cried Boswell. &ldquo;From Scotland,&rdquo; said Davies roguishly. &ldquo;Mr. Johnson,&rdquo; said Boswell, &ldquo;I do indeed come from Scotland; but I cannot help it!&rdquo; &ldquo;That, sir,&rdquo; was the first of Johnson&rsquo;s many retorts to his worshipper, &ldquo;is what a great many of your countrymen cannot help.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Poor Boswell was stunned; but he recovered when Johnson observed to Davies, &ldquo;What do you think of Garrick? He has refused me an order for the play for Miss Williams because he knows the house will be full, and that an order would be worth three shillings.&rdquo; &ldquo;O, sir,&rdquo; intruded the unlucky Boswell, &ldquo;I cannot think Mr. Garrick would grudge such a trifle to you.&rdquo; &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; replied Johnson sternly, &ldquo;I have known David Garrick longer than you have done, and I know no right you have to talk to me on the subject.&rdquo; The second blow might have crushed a less intrepid curiosity. Boswell, though silenced, gradually recovered sufficiently to listen, and afterwards to note down parts of the conversation. As the interview went on, he even ventured to make a remark or two, which were very civilly received; Davies consoled him at his departure by assuring him that the great man liked him very well. &ldquo;I cannot conceive a more humiliating position,&rdquo; said Beauclerk on another occasion, &ldquo;than to be clapped on the back by Tom Davies.&rdquo; For the present, however, even Tom Davies was a welcome encourager to one who, for the rest, was not easily rebuffed. A few days afterwards Boswell ventured a call, was kindly received and detained for some time by &ldquo;the giant in his den.&rdquo; He was still a little afraid of the said giant, who had shortly before administered a vigorous retort to his countryman Blair. Blair had asked Johnson whether he thought that any man of a modern age could have written <span class="t8">Ossian</span>. &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; replied Johnson, &ldquo;many men, many women, and many children.&rdquo; Boswell, however, got on very well, and before long had the high honour of drinking a bottle of port with Johnson at the Mitre, and receiving, after a little autobiographical sketch, the emphatic approval, &ldquo;Give me your hand, I have taken a liking to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">In a very short time Boswell was on sufficiently easy terms with Johnson, not merely to frequent his levées but to ask him to dinner at the Mitre. He gathered up, though without the skill of his later performances, some fragments of the conversational feast. The great man aimed another blow or two at Scotch prejudices. To an unlucky compatriot of Boswell&rsquo;s, who claimed for his country a great many &ldquo;noble wild prospects,&rdquo; Johnson replied, &ldquo;I believe, sir, you have a great many, Norway, too, has noble wild prospects; and Lapland is remarkable for prodigious noble wild prospects. But, sir, let me tell you the noblest prospect which a Scotchman ever sees, is the high road that leads him to England.&rdquo; Though Boswell makes a slight remonstrance about the &ldquo;rude grandeur of Nature&rdquo; as seen in &ldquo;Caledonia,&rdquo; he sympathized in this with his teacher. Johnson said afterwards, that he never knew any one with &ldquo;such a gust for London.&rdquo; Before long he was trying Boswell&rsquo;s tastes by asking him in Greenwich Park, &ldquo;Is not this very fine?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; replied the promising disciple, &ldquo;but not equal to Fleet Street.&rdquo; &ldquo;You are right, sir,&rdquo; said the sage; and Boswell illustrates his dictum by the authority of a &ldquo;very fashionable baronet,&rdquo; and, moreover, a baronet from Rydal, who declared that the fragrance of a May evening in the country might be very well, but that he preferred the smell of a flambeau at the playhouse. In more serious moods Johnson delighted his new disciple by discussions upon theological, social, and literary topics. He argued with an unfortunate friend of Boswell&rsquo;s, whose mind, it appears, had been poisoned by Hume, and who was, moreover, rash enough to undertake the defence of principles of political equality. Johnson&rsquo;s view of all propagators of new opinions was tolerably simple. &ldquo;Hume, and other sceptical innovators,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;are vain men, and will gratify themselves at any expense. Truth will not afford sufficient food to their vanity; so they have betaken themselves to error. Truth, sir, is a cow which will yield such people no more milk, and so they are gone to milk the bull.&rdquo; On another occasion poor Boswell, not yet acquainted with the master&rsquo;s prejudices, quoted with hearty laughter a &ldquo;very strange&rdquo; story which Hume had told him of Johnson. According to Hume, Johnson had said that he would stand before a battery of cannon to restore Convocation to its full powers. &ldquo;And would I not, sir?&rdquo; thundered out the sage with flashing eyes and threatening gestures. Boswell judiciously bowed to the storm, and diverted Johnson&rsquo;s attention. Another manifestation of orthodox prejudice was less terrible. Boswell told Johnson that he had heard a Quaker woman preach. &ldquo;A woman&rsquo;s preaching,&rdquo; said Johnson, &ldquo;is like a dog&rsquo;s walking on his hind legs. It is not done well; but you are surprised to find it done at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">So friendly had the pair become, that when Boswell left England to continue his studies at Utrecht, Johnson accompanied him in the stage-coach to Harwich, amusing him on the way by his frankness of address to fellow-passengers, and by the voracity of his appetite. He gave him some excellent advice, remarking of a moth which fluttered into a candle, &ldquo;that creature was its own tormentor, and I believe its name was Boswell.&rdquo; He refuted Berkeley by striking his foot with mighty force against a large stone, till he rebounded from it. As the ship put out to sea Boswell watched him from the deck, whilst he remained &ldquo;rolling his majestic frame in his usual manner.&rdquo; And so the friendship was cemented, though Boswell disappeared for a time from the scene, travelled on the Continent, and visited Paoli in Corsica. A friendly letter or two kept up the connexion till Boswell returned in 1766, with his head full of Corsica and a projected book of travels.</p>
<p class="p24">In the next year, 1767, occurred an incident upon which Boswell dwells with extreme complacency. Johnson was in the habit of sometimes reading in the King&rsquo;s Library, and it came into the head of his majesty that he should like to see the uncouth monster upon whom he had bestowed a pension. In spite of his semi-humorous Jacobitism, there was probably not a more loyal subject in his majesty&rsquo;s dominions. Loyalty is a word too often used to designate a sentiment worthy only of valets, advertising tradesmen, and writers of claptrap articles. But it deserves all respect when it reposes, as in Johnson&rsquo;s case, upon a profound conviction of the value of political subordination, and an acceptance of the king as the authorized representative of a great principle. There was no touch of servility in Johnson&rsquo;s respect for his sovereign, a respect fully reconcilable with a sense of his own personal dignity. Johnson spoke of his interview with an unfeigned satisfaction, which it would be difficult in these days to preserve from the taint of snobbishness. He described it frequently to his friends, and Boswell with pious care ascertained the details from Johnson himself, and from various secondary sources. He contrived afterwards to get his minute submitted to the King himself, who graciously authorized its publication. When he was preparing his biography, he published this account with the letter to Chesterfield in a small pamphlet sold at a prohibitory price, in order to secure the copyright.</p>
<p class="p24">&ldquo;I find,&rdquo; said Johnson afterwards, &ldquo;that it does a man good to be talked to by his sovereign. In the first place a man cannot be in a passion.&rdquo; What other advantages he perceived must be unknown, for here the oracle was interrupted. But whatever the advantages, it could hardly be reckoned amongst them, that there would be room for the hearty cut and thrust retorts which enlivened his ordinary talk. To us accordingly the conversation is chiefly interesting as illustrating what Johnson meant by his politeness. He found that the King wanted him to talk, and he talked accordingly. He spoke in a &ldquo;firm manly manner, with a sonorous voice,&rdquo; and not in the subdued tone customary at formal receptions. He dilated upon various literary topics, on the libraries of Oxford and Cambridge, on some contemporary controversies, on the quack Dr. Hill, and upon the reviews of the day. All that is worth repeating is a complimentary passage which shows Johnson&rsquo;s possession of that courtesy which rests upon sense and self-respect. The King asked whether he was writing anything, and Johnson excused himself by saying that he had told the world what he knew for the present, and had &ldquo;done his part as a writer.&rdquo; &ldquo;I should have thought so too,&rdquo; said the King, &ldquo;if you had not written so well.&rdquo; &ldquo;No man,&rdquo; said Johnson, &ldquo;could have paid a higher compliment; and it was fit for a King to pay &mdash; it was decisive.&rdquo; When asked if he had replied, he said, &ldquo;No, sir. When the King had said it, it was to be. It was not for me to bandy civilities with my sovereign.&rdquo; Johnson was not the less delighted. &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; he said to the librarian, &ldquo;they may talk of the King as they will, but he is the finest gentleman I have ever seen.&rdquo; And he afterwards compared his manners to those of Louis XIV., and his favourite, Charles II. Goldsmith, says Boswell, was silent during the narrative, because (so his kind friend supposed) he was jealous of the honour paid to the dictator. But his natural simplicity prevailed. He ran to Johnson, and exclaimed in &lsquo;a kind of flutter,&rsquo; &ldquo;Well, you acquitted yourself in this conversation better than I should have done, for I should have bowed and stammered through the whole of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">The years 1768 and 1769 were a period of great excitement for Boswell. He was carrying on various love affairs, which ended with his marriage in the end of 1769. He was publishing his book upon Corsica and paying homage to Paoli, who arrived in England in the autumn of the same year. The book appeared in the beginning of 1768, and he begs his friend Temple to report all that is said about it, but with the restriction that he is to conceal <span class="t8">all censure</span>. He particularly wanted Gray&rsquo;s opinion, as Gray was a friend of Temple&rsquo;s. Gray&rsquo;s opinion, not conveyed to Boswell, was expressed by his calling it &ldquo;a dialogue between a green goose and a hero.&rdquo; Boswell, who was cultivating the society of various eminent people, exclaims triumphantly in a letter to Temple (April 26, 1768), &ldquo;I am really the great man now.&rdquo; Johnson and Hume had called upon him on the same day, and Garrick, Franklin, and Oglethorpe also partook of his &ldquo;admirable dinners and good claret.&rdquo; &ldquo;This,&rdquo; he says, with the sense that he deserved his honours, &ldquo;is enjoying the fruit of my labours, and appearing like the friend of Paoli.&rdquo; Johnson in vain expressed a wish that he would &ldquo;empty his head of Corsica, which had filled it too long.&rdquo; &ldquo;Empty my head of Corsica! Empty it of honour, empty it of friendship, empty it of piety!&rdquo; exclaims the ardent youth. The next year accordingly saw Boswell&rsquo;s appearance at the Stratford Jubilee, where he paraded to the admiration of all beholders in a costume described by himself (apparently) in a glowing article in the <span class="t8">London Magazine</span>. &ldquo;Is it wrong, sir,&rdquo; he took speedy opportunity of inquiring from the oracle, &ldquo;to affect singularity in order to make people stare?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Johnson, &ldquo;if you do it by propagating error, and indeed it is wrong in any way. There is in human nature a general inclination to make people stare, and every wise man has himself to cure of it, and does cure himself. If you wish to make people stare by doing better than others, why make them stare till they stare their eyes out. But consider how easy it is to make people stare by being absurd&rdquo; &mdash; a proposition which he proceeds to illustrate by examples perhaps less telling than Boswell&rsquo;s recent performance.</p>
<p class="p24">The sage was less communicative on the question of marriage, though Boswell had anticipated some &ldquo;instructive conversation&rdquo; upon that topic. His sole remark was one from which Boswell &ldquo;humbly differed.&rdquo; Johnson maintained that a wife was not the worse for being learned. Boswell, on the other hand, defined the proper degree of intelligence to be desired in a female companion by some verses in which Sir Thomas Overbury says that a wife should have some knowledge, and be &ldquo;by nature wise, not learned much by art.&rdquo; Johnson said afterwards that Mrs. Boswell was in a proper degree inferior to her husband. So far as we can tell, she seems to have been a really sensible, and good woman, who kept her husband&rsquo;s absurdities in check, and was, in her way, a better wife than he deserved. So, happily, are most wives.</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson and Boswell had several meetings in 1769. Boswell had the honour of introducing the two objects of his idolatry, Johnson and Paoli, and on another occasion entertained a party including Goldsmith and Garrick and Reynolds, at his lodgings in Old Bond Street. We can still see the meeting more distinctly than many that have been swallowed by a few days of oblivion. They waited for one of the party, Johnson kindly maintaining that six ought to be kept waiting for one, if the one would suffer more by the others sitting down than the six by waiting. Meanwhile Garrick &ldquo;played round Johnson with a fond vivacity, taking hold of the breasts of his coat, looking up in his face with a lively archness,&rdquo; and complimenting him on his good health. Goldsmith strutted about bragging of his dress, of which Boswell, in the serene consciousness of superiority to such weakness, thought him seriously vain. &ldquo;Let me tell you,&rdquo; said Goldsmith, &ldquo;when my tailor brought home my bloom-coloured coat, he said, &lsquo;Sir, I have a favour to beg of you; when anybody asks you who made your clothes, be pleased to mention John Filby, at the Harrow, Water Lane.&rsquo;&rdquo; &ldquo;Why, sir,&rdquo; said Johnson, &ldquo;that was because he knew that the strange colour would attract crowds to gaze at it, and thus they might hear of him, and see how well he could make a coat even of so absurd a colour.&rdquo; Mr. Filby has gone the way of all tailors and bloom-coloured coats, but some of his bills are preserved. On the day of this dinner he had delivered to Goldsmith a half-dress suit of ratteen lined with satin, costing twelve guineas, a pair of silk stocking-breeches for £2 5<span class="t8">s</span>. and a pair of bloom-coloured ditto for £1 4<span class="t8">s</span>. 6<span class="t8">d</span>. The bill, including other items, was paid, it is satisfactory to add, in February, 1771.</p>
<p class="p24">The conversation was chiefly literary. Johnson repeated the concluding lines of the <span class="t8">Dunciad</span>; upon which some one (probably Boswell) ventured to say that they were &ldquo;too fine for such a poem &mdash; a poem on what?&rdquo; &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said Johnson, &ldquo;on dunces! It was worth while being a dunce then. Ah, sir, hadst <span class="t8">thou</span> lived in those days!&rdquo; Johnson previously uttered a criticism which has led some people to think that he had a touch of the dunce in him. He declared that a description of a temple in Congreve&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Mourning Bride</span> was the finest he knew &mdash; finer than anything in Shakspeare. Garrick vainly protested; but Johnson was inexorable. He compared Congreve to a man who had only ten guineas in the world, but all in one coin; whereas Shakspeare might have ten thousand separate guineas. The principle of the criticism is rather curious. &ldquo;What I mean is,&rdquo; said Johnson, &ldquo;that you can show me no passage where there is simply a description of material objects, without any admixture of moral notions, which produces such an effect.&rdquo; The description of the night before Agincourt was rejected because there were men in it; and the description of Dover Cliff because the boats and the crows &ldquo;impede yon fall.&rdquo; They do &ldquo;not impress your mind at once with the horrible idea of immense height. The impression is divided; you pass on by computation from one stage of the tremendous space to another.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Probably most people will think that the passage in question deserves a very slight fraction of the praise bestowed upon it; but the criticism, like most of Johnson&rsquo;s, has a meaning which might be worth examining abstractedly from the special application which shocks the idolaters of Shakspeare. Presently the party discussed Mrs. Montagu, whose Essay upon Shakspeare had made some noise. Johnson had a respect for her, caused in great measure by a sense of her liberality to his friend Miss Williams, of whom more must be said hereafter. He paid her some tremendous compliments, observing that some China plates which had belonged to Queen Elizabeth and to her, had no reason to be ashamed of a possessor so little inferior to the first. But he had his usual professional contempt for her amateur performances in literature. Her defence of Shakspeare against Voltaire did her honour, he admitted, but it would do nobody else honour. &ldquo;No, sir, there is no real criticism in it: none showing the beauty of thought, as formed on the workings of the human heart.&rdquo; Mrs. Montagu was reported once to have complimented a modern tragedian, probably Jephson, by saying, &ldquo;I tremble for Shakspeare.&rdquo; &ldquo;When Shakspeare,&rdquo; said Johnson, &ldquo;has got Jephson for his rival and Mrs. Montagu for his defender, he is in a poor state indeed.&rdquo; The conversation went on to a recently published book, <span class="t8">Kames&rsquo;s Elements of Criticism</span>, which Johnson praised, whilst Goldsmith said more truly, &ldquo;It is easier to write that book than to read it.&rdquo; Johnson went on to speak of other critics. &ldquo;There is no great merit,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;in telling how many plays have ghosts in them, and how this ghost is better than that. You must show how terror is impressed on the human heart. In the description of night in <span class="t8">Macbeth</span> the beetle and the bat detract from the general idea of darkness &mdash; inspissated gloom.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">After Boswell&rsquo;s marriage he disappeared for some time from London, and his correspondence with Johnson dropped, as he says, without coldness, from pure procrastination. He did not return to London till 1772. In the spring of that and the following year he renewed his old habits of intimacy, and inquired into Johnson&rsquo;s opinion upon various subjects ranging from ghosts to literary criticism. The height to which he had risen in the doctor&rsquo;s good opinion was marked by several symptoms. He was asked to dine at Johnson&rsquo;s house upon Easter day, 1773; and observes that his curiosity was as much gratified as by a previous dinner with Rousseau in the &ldquo;wilds of Neufchatel.&rdquo; He was now able to report, to the amazement of many inquirers, that Johnson&rsquo;s establishment was quite orderly. The meal consisted of very good soup, a boiled leg of lamb with spinach, a veal pie, and a rice pudding. A stronger testimony of good-will was his election, by Johnson&rsquo;s influence, into the Club. It ought apparently to be said that Johnson forced him upon the Club by letting it be understood that, till Boswell was admitted, no other candidate would have a chance. Boswell, however, was, as his proposer said, a thoroughly &ldquo;clubable&rdquo; man, and once a member, his good humour secured his popularity. On the important evening Boswell dined at Beauclerk&rsquo;s with his proposer and some other members. The talk turned upon Goldsmith&rsquo;s merits; and Johnson not only defended his poetry, but preferred him as a historian to Robertson. Such a judgment could be explained in Boswell&rsquo;s opinion by nothing but Johnson&rsquo;s dislike to the Scotch. Once before, when Boswell had mentioned Robertson in order to meet Johnson&rsquo;s condemnation of Scotch literature in general, Johnson had evaded him; &ldquo;Sir, I love Robertson, and I won&rsquo;t talk of his book.&rdquo; On the present occasion he said that he would give to Robertson the advice offered by an old college tutor to a pupil; &ldquo;read over your compositions, and whenever you meet with a passage which you think particularly fine, strike it out.&rdquo; A good anecdote of Goldsmith followed. Johnson had said to him once in the Poet&rsquo;s Corner at Westminster, &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">Forsitan et nostrum nomen miscebitur istis.</p>
<p class="p26">When they got to Temple Bar Goldsmith pointed to the heads of the<br/>Jacobites upon it and slily suggested, &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">Forsitan et nostrum nomen miscebitur <span class="t8">istis</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson next pronounced a critical judgment which should be set against many sins of that kind. He praised the <span class="t8">Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress</span> very warmly, and suggested that Bunyan had probably read Spenser.</p>
<p class="p24">After more talk the gentlemen went to the Club; and poor Boswell remained trembling with an anxiety which even the claims of Lady Di Beauclerk&rsquo;s conversation could not dissipate. The welcome news of his election was brought; and Boswell went to see Burke for the first time, and to receive a humorous charge from Johnson, pointing out the conduct expected from him as a good member. Perhaps some hints were given as to betrayal of confidence. Boswell seems at any rate to have had a certain reserve in repeating Club talk.</p>
<p class="p24">This intimacy with Johnson was about to receive a more public and even more impressive stamp. The antipathy to Scotland and the Scotch already noticed was one of Johnson&rsquo;s most notorious crotchets. The origin of the prejudice was forgotten by Johnson himself, though he was willing to accept a theory started by old Sheridan that it was resentment for the betrayal of Charles I. There is, however, nothing surprising in Johnson&rsquo;s partaking a prejudice common enough from the days of his youth, when each people supposed itself to have been cheated by the Union, and Englishmen resented the advent of swarms of needy adventurers, talking with a strange accent and hanging together with honourable but vexatious persistence. Johnson was irritated by what was, after all, a natural defence against English prejudice. He declared that the Scotch were always ready to lie on each other&rsquo;s behalf. &ldquo;The Irish,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;are not in a conspiracy to cheat the world by false representations of the merits of their countrymen. No, sir, the Irish are a fair people; they never speak well of one another.&rdquo; There was another difference. He always expressed a generous resentment against the tyranny exercised by English rulers over the Irish people. To some one who defended the restriction of Irish trade for the good of English merchants, he said, &ldquo;Sir, you talk the language of a savage. What! sir, would you prevent any people from feeding themselves, if by any honest means they can do it?&rdquo; It was &ldquo;better to hang or drown people at once,&rdquo; than weaken them by unrelenting persecution. He felt some tenderness for Catholics, especially when oppressed, and a hearty antipathy towards prosperous Presbyterians. The Lowland Scotch were typified by John Knox, in regard to whom he expressed a hope, after viewing the ruins of St. Andrew&rsquo;s, that he was buried &ldquo;in the highway.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">This sturdy British and High Church prejudice did not prevent the worthy doctor from having many warm friendships with Scotchmen, and helping many distressed Scotchmen in London. Most of the amanuenses employed for his <span class="t8">Dictionary</span> were Scotch. But he nourished the prejudice the more as giving an excellent pretext for many keen gibes. &ldquo;Scotch learning,&rdquo; he said, for example, &ldquo;is like bread in a besieged town. Every man gets a mouthful, but no man a bellyful.&rdquo; Once Strahan said in answer to some abusive remarks, &ldquo;Well, sir, God made Scotland.&rdquo; &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; replied Johnson, &ldquo;but we must always remember that He made it for Scotchmen; and comparisons are odious, Mr. Strahan, but God made hell.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Boswell, therefore, had reason to feel both triumph and alarm when he induced the great man to accompany him in a Scotch tour. Boswell&rsquo;s journal of the tour appeared soon after Johnson&rsquo;s death. Johnson himself wrote an account of it, which is not without interest, though it is in his dignified style, which does not condescend to Boswellian touches of character. In 1773 the Scotch Highlands were still a little known region, justifying a book descriptive of manners and customs, and touching upon antiquities now the commonplaces of innumerable guide books. Scott was still an infant, and the day of enthusiasm, real or affected, for mountain scenery had not yet dawned. Neither of the travellers, as Boswell remarks, cared much for &ldquo;rural beauties.&rdquo; Johnson says quaintly on the shores of Loch Ness, &ldquo;It will very readily occur that this uniformity of barrenness can afford very little amusement to the traveller; that it is easy to sit at home and conceive rocks and heath and waterfalls; and that these journeys are useless labours, which neither impregnate the imagination nor enlarge the understanding.&rdquo; And though he shortly afterwards sits down on a bank &ldquo;such as a writer of romance might have delighted to feign,&rdquo; and there conceived the thought of his book, he does not seem to have felt much enthusiasm. He checked Boswell for describing a hill as &ldquo;immense,&rdquo; and told him that it was only a &ldquo;considerable protuberance.&rdquo; Indeed it is not surprising if he sometimes grew weary in long rides upon Highland ponies, or if, when weatherbound in a remote village in Skye, he declared that this was a &ldquo;waste of life.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On the whole, however, Johnson bore his fatigues well, preserved his temper, and made sensible remarks upon men and things. The pair started from Edinburgh in the middle of August, 1773; they went north along the eastern coast, through St. Andrew&rsquo;s, Aberdeen, Banff, Fort George, and Inverness. There they took to horses, rode to Glenelg, and took boat for Skye, where they landed on the 2nd of September. They visited Rothsay, Col, Mull, and Iona, and after some dangerous sailing got to the mainland at Oban on October 2nd. Thence they proceeded by Inverary and Loch Lomond to Glasgow; and after paying a visit to Boswell&rsquo;s paternal mansion at Auchinleck in Ayrshire, returned to Edinburgh in November. It were too long to narrate their adventures at length, or to describe in detail how Johnson grieved over traces of the iconoclastic zeal of Knox&rsquo;s disciples, seriously investigated stories of second-sight, cross-examined and brow-beat credulous believers in the authenticity of <span class="t8">Ossian</span>, and felt his piety grow warm among the ruins of Iona. Once or twice, when the temper of the travellers was tried by the various worries incident to their position, poor Boswell came in for some severe blows. But he was happy, feeling, as he remarks, like a dog who has run away with a large piece of meat, and is devouring it peacefully in a corner by himself. Boswell&rsquo;s spirits were irrepressible. On hearing a drum beat for dinner at Fort George, he says, with a Pepys-like touch, &ldquo;I for a little while fancied myself a military man, and it pleased me.&rdquo; He got scandalously drunk on one occasion, and showed reprehensible levity on others. He bored Johnson by inquiring too curiously into his reasons for not wearing a nightcap &mdash; a subject which seems to have interested him profoundly; he permitted himself to say in his journal that he was so much pleased with some pretty ladies&rsquo; maids at the Duke of Argyll&rsquo;s, that he felt he could &ldquo;have been a knight-errant for them,&rdquo; and his &ldquo;venerable fellow-traveller&rdquo; read the passage without censuring his levity. The great man himself could be equally volatile. &ldquo;I <span class="t8">have often thought</span>,&rdquo; he observed one day, to Boswell&rsquo;s amusement, &ldquo;that if I kept a seraglio, the ladies should all wear linen gowns&rdquo; &mdash; as more cleanly. The pair agreed in trying to stimulate the feudal zeal of various Highland chiefs with whom they came in contact, and who were unreasonable enough to show a hankering after the luxuries of civilization.</p>
<p class="p24">Though Johnson seems to have been generally on his best behaviour, he had a rough encounter or two with some of the more civilized natives. Boswell piloted him safely through a visit to Lord Monboddo, a man of real ability, though the proprietor of crochets as eccentric as Johnson&rsquo;s, and consequently divided from him by strong mutual prejudices. At Auchinleck he was less fortunate. The old laird, who was the staunchest of Whigs, had not relished his son&rsquo;s hero-worship. &ldquo;There is nae hope for Jamie, mon; Jamie is gaen clean gyte. What do you think, mon? He&rsquo;s done wi&rsquo; Paoli &mdash; he&rsquo;s off wi&rsquo; the land-louping scoundrel of a Corsican, and who&rsquo;s tail do you think he&rsquo;s pinned himself to now, mon?&rdquo; &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; says Sir Walter Scott, the authority for the story, &ldquo;the old judge summoned up a sneer of most sovereign contempt. &lsquo;A dominie, mon &mdash; an auld dominie &mdash; he keeped a schule and caauld it an acaademy.&rsquo;&rdquo; The two managed to keep the peace till, one day during Johnson&rsquo;s visit, they got upon Oliver Cromwell. Boswell suppresses the scene with obvious reluctance, his openness being checked for once by filial respect. Scott has fortunately preserved the climax of Old Boswell&rsquo;s argument. &ldquo;What had Cromwell done for his country?&rdquo; asked Johnson. &ldquo;God, doctor, he gart Kings ken that they had a <span class="t8">lith</span> in their necks&rdquo; retorted the laird, in a phrase worthy of Mr. Carlyle himself. Scott reports one other scene, at which respectable commentators, like Croker, hold up their hands in horror. Should we regret or rejoice to say that it involves an obvious inaccuracy? The authority, however, is too good to allow us to suppose that it was without some foundation. Adam Smith, it is said, met Johnson at Glasgow and had an altercation with him about the well-known account of Hume&rsquo;s death. As Hume did not die till three years later, there must be some error in this. The dispute, however, whatever its date or subject, ended by Johnson saying to Smith, &ldquo;<span class="t8">You lie</span>.&rdquo; &ldquo;And what did you reply?&rdquo; was asked of Smith. &ldquo;I said, &lsquo;you are a son of a &mdash;&mdash; .&rsquo;&rdquo; &ldquo;On such terms,&rdquo; says Scott, &ldquo;did these two great moralists meet and part, and such was the classical dialogue between these two great teachers of morality.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">In the year 1774 Boswell found it expedient to atone for his long absence in the previous year by staying at home. Johnson managed to complete his account of the <span class="t8">Scotch Tour</span>, which was published at the end of the year. Among other consequences was a violent controversy with the lovers of <span class="t8">Ossian</span>. Johnson was a thorough sceptic as to the authenticity of the book. His scepticism did not repose upon the philological or antiquarian reasonings, which would be applicable in the controversy from internal evidence. It was to some extent the expression of a general incredulity which astonished his friends, especially when contrasted with his tenderness for many puerile superstitions. He could scarcely be induced to admit the truth of any narrative which struck him as odd, and it was long, for example, before he would believe even in the Lisbon earthquake. Yet he seriously discussed the truth of second-sight; he carefully investigated the Cock-lane ghost &mdash; a goblin who anticipated some of the modern phenomena of so-called &ldquo;spiritualism,&rdquo; and with almost equal absurdity; he told stories to Boswell about a &ldquo;shadowy being&rdquo; which had once been seen by Cave, and declared that he had once heard his mother call &ldquo;Sam&rdquo; when he was at Oxford and she at Lichfield. The apparent inconsistency was in truth natural enough. Any man who clings with unreasonable pertinacity to the prejudices of his childhood, must be alternately credulous and sceptical in excess. In both cases, he judges by his fancies in defiance of evidence; and accepts and rejects according to his likes and dislikes, instead of his estimates of logical proof. <span class="t8">Ossian</span> would be naturally offensive to Johnson, as one of the earliest and most remarkable manifestations of that growing taste for what was called &ldquo;Nature,&rdquo; as opposed to civilization, of which Rousseau was the great mouthpiece. Nobody more heartily despised this form of &ldquo;cant&rdquo; than Johnson. A man who utterly despised the scenery of the Hebrides as compared with Greenwich Park or Charing Cross, would hardly take kindly to the Ossianesque version of the mountain passion. The book struck him as sheer rubbish. I have already quoted the retort about &ldquo;many men, many women, and many children.&rdquo; &ldquo;A man,&rdquo; he said, on another occasion, &ldquo;might write such stuff for ever, if he would abandon his mind to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">The precise point, however, upon which he rested his case, was the tangible one of the inability of Macpherson to produce the manuscripts of which he had affirmed the existence. MacPherson wrote a furious letter to Johnson, of which the purport can only be inferred from Johnson&rsquo;s smashing retort, &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&ldquo;Mr. James MacPherson, I have received your foolish and impudent letter. Any violence offered me I shall do my best to repel; and what I cannot do for myself, the law shall do for me. I hope I shall never be deterred from detecting what I think a cheat by the menaces of a ruffian.</p>
<p class="p24">&ldquo;What would you have me retract? I thought your book an imposture: I think it an imposture still. For this opinion I have given my reasons to the public, which I here dare you to refute. Your rage I defy. Your abilities, since your <span class="t8">Homer</span>, are not so formidable; and what I hear of your morals inclines me to pay regard not to what you shall say, but to what you shall prove. You may print this if you will.</p>
<p class="p10">&ldquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p21">And so laying in a tremendous cudgel, the old gentleman (he was now sixty-six) awaited the assault, which, however, was not delivered.</p>
<p class="p24">In 1775 Boswell again came to London, and renewed some of the Scotch discussions. He attended a meeting of the Literary Club, and found the members disposed to laugh at Johnson&rsquo;s tenderness to the stories about second-sight. Boswell heroically avowed his own belief. &ldquo;The evidence,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is enough for me, though not for his great mind. What will not fill a quart bottle, will fill a pint bottle. I am filled with belief.&rdquo; &ldquo;Are you?&rdquo; said Colman; &ldquo;then cork it up.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">It was during this and the next few years that Boswell laboured most successfully in gathering materials for his book. In 1777 he only met Johnson in the country. In 1779, for some unexplained reason, he was lazy in making notes; in 1780 and 1781 he was absent from London; and in the following year, Johnson was visibly declining. The tenour of Johnson&rsquo;s life was interrupted during this period by no remarkable incidents, and his literary activity was not great, although the composition of the <span class="t8">Lives of the Poets</span> falls between 1777 and 1780. His mind, however, as represented by his talk, was in full vigour. I will take in order of time a few of the passages recorded by Boswell, which may serve for various reasons to afford the best illustration of his character. Yet it may be worth while once more to repeat the warning that such fragments moved from their context must lose most of their charm.</p>
<p class="p24">On March 26th (1775), Boswell met Johnson at the house of the publisher, Strahan. Strahan reminded Johnson of a characteristic remark which he had formerly made, that there are &ldquo;few ways in which a man can be more innocently employed than in getting money.&rdquo; On another occasion Johnson observed with equal truth, if less originality, that cultivating kindness was an important part of life, as well as money-making. Johnson then asked to see a country lad whom he had recommended to Strahan as an apprentice. He asked for five guineas on account, that he might give one to the boy. &ldquo;Nay, if a man recommends a boy and does nothing for him, it is sad work.&rdquo; A &ldquo;little, thick short-legged boy&rdquo; was accordingly brought into the courtyard, whither Johnson and Boswell descended, and the lexicographer bending himself down administered some good advice to the awestruck lad with &ldquo;slow and sonorous solemnity,&rdquo; ending by the presentation of the guinea.</p>
<p class="p24">In the evening the pair formed part of a corps of party &ldquo;wits,&rdquo; led by Sir Joshua Reynolds, to the benefit of Mrs. Abingdon, who had been a frequent model of the painter. Johnson praised Garrick&rsquo;s prologues, and Boswell kindly reported the eulogy to Garrick, with whom he supped at Beauclerk&rsquo;s. Garrick treated him to a mimicry of Johnson, repeating, &ldquo;with pauses and half-whistling,&rdquo; the lines, &mdash; </p>
<p class="p26">&nbsp;Os homini sublime dedit &mdash; coelumque tueri<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Jussit &mdash; et erectos ad sidera tollere vultus:</p>
<p class="p24">looking downwards, and at the end touching the ground with a contorted gesticulation. Garrick was generally jealous of Johnson&rsquo;s light opinion of him, and used to take off his old master, saying, &ldquo;Davy has some convivial pleasantry about him, but &rsquo;tis a futile fellow.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Next day, at Thrales&rsquo;, Johnson fell foul of Gray, one of his pet aversions. Boswell denied that Gray was dull in poetry. &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; replied Johnson, &ldquo;he was dull in company, dull in his closet, dull everywhere. He was dull in a new way, and that made people think him great. He was a mechanical poet.&rdquo; He proceeded to say that there were only two good stanzas in the <span class="t8">Elegy</span>. Johnson&rsquo;s criticism was perverse; but if we were to collect a few of the judgments passed by contemporaries upon each other, it would be scarcely exceptional in its want of appreciation. It is rather odd to remark that Gray was generally condemned for obscurity &mdash; a charge which seems strangely out of place when he is measured by more recent standards.</p>
<p class="p24">A day or two afterwards some one rallied Johnson on his appearance at Mrs. Abingdon&rsquo;s benefit. &ldquo;Why did you go?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Did you see?&rdquo; &ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo; &ldquo;Did you hear?&rdquo; &ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo; &ldquo;Why, then, sir, did you go?&rdquo; &ldquo;Because, sir, she is a favourite of the public; and when the public cares the thousandth part for you that it does for her, I will go to your benefit too.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">The day after, Boswell won a bet from Lady Di Beauclerk by venturing to ask Johnson what he did with the orange-peel which he used to pocket. Johnson received the question amicably, but did not clear the mystery. &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Boswell, &ldquo;the world must be left in the dark. It must be said, he scraped them, and he let them dry, but what he did with them next he never could be prevailed upon to tell.&rdquo; &ldquo;Nay, sir,&rdquo; replied Johnson, &ldquo;you should say it more emphatically &mdash; he could not be prevailed upon, even by his dearest friends to tell.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">This year Johnson received the degree of LL.D. from Oxford. He had previously (in 1765) received the same honour from Dublin. It is remarkable, however, that familiar as the title has become, Johnson called himself plain Mr. to the end of his days, and was generally so called by his intimates. On April 2nd, at a dinner at Hoole&rsquo;s, Johnson made another assault upon Gray and Mason. When Boswell said that there were good passages in Mason&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Elfrida</span>, he conceded that there were &ldquo;now and then some good imitations of Milton&rsquo;s bad manner.&rdquo; After some more talk, Boswell spoke of the cheerfulness of Fleet Street. &ldquo;Why, sir,&rdquo; said Johnson, &ldquo;Fleet Street has a very animated appearance, but I think that the full tide of human existence is at Charing Cross.&rdquo; He added a story of an eminent tallow-chandler who had made a fortune in London, and was foolish enough to retire to the country. He grew so tired of his retreat, that he begged to know the melting-days of his successor, that he might be present at the operation.</p>
<p class="p24">On April 7th, they dined at a tavern, where the talk turned upon <span class="t8">Ossian</span>. Some one mentioned as an objection to its authenticity that no mention of wolves occurred in it. Johnson fell into a reverie upon wild beasts, and, whilst Reynolds and Langton were discussing something, he broke out, &ldquo;Pennant tells of bears.&rdquo; What Pennant told is unknown. The company continued to talk, whilst Johnson continued his monologue, the word &ldquo;bear&rdquo; occurring at intervals, like a word in a catch. At last, when a pause came, he was going on: &ldquo;We are told that the black bear is innocent, but I should not like to trust myself with him.&rdquo; Gibbon muttered in a low tone, &ldquo;I should not like to trust myself with <span class="t8">you</span>&rdquo; &mdash; a prudent resolution, says honest Boswell who hated Gibbon, if it referred to a competition of abilities.</p>
<p class="p24">The talk went on to patriotism, and Johnson laid down an apophthegm, at &ldquo;which many will start,&rdquo; many people, in fact, having little sense of humour. Such persons may be reminded for their comfort that at this period patriot had a technical meaning. &ldquo;Patriotism is the last refuge of a scoundrel.&rdquo; On the 10th of April, he laid down another dogma, calculated to offend the weaker brethren. He defended Pope&rsquo;s line &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">Man never <span class="t8">is</span> but always <span class="t8">to be</span> blest.</p>
<p class="p24">And being asked if man did not sometimes enjoy a momentary happiness, replied, &ldquo;Never, but when he is drunk.&rdquo; It would be useless to defend these and other such utterances to any one who cannot enjoy them without defence.</p>
<p class="p24">On April 11th, the pair went in Reynolds&rsquo;s coach to dine with Cambridge, at Twickenham. Johnson was in high spirits. He remarked as they drove down, upon the rarity of good humour in life. One friend mentioned by Boswell was, he said, <span class="t8">acid</span>, and another <span class="t8">muddy</span>. At last, stretching himself and turning with complacency, he observed, &ldquo;I look upon myself as a good-humoured fellow&rdquo; &mdash; a bit of self-esteem against which Boswell protested. Johnson, he admitted, was good-natured; but was too irascible and impatient to be good-humoured. On reaching Cambridge&rsquo;s house, Johnson ran to look at the books. &ldquo;Mr. Johnson,&rdquo; said Cambridge politely, &ldquo;I am going with your pardon to accuse myself, for I have the same custom which I perceive you have. But it seems odd that one should have such a desire to look at the backs of books.&rdquo; &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; replied Johnson, wheeling about at the words, &ldquo;the reason is very plain. Knowledge is of two kinds. We know a subject ourselves, or we know where we can find information upon it. When we inquire into any subject, the first thing we have to do is to know what books have treated of it. This leads us to look at catalogues, and the backs of books in libraries.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">A pleasant talk followed. Johnson denied the value attributed to historical reading, on the ground that we know very little except a few facts and dates. All the colouring, he said, was conjectural. Boswell chuckles over the reflection that Gibbon, who was present, did not take up the cudgels for his favourite study, though the first-fruits of his labours were to appear in the following year. &ldquo;Probably he did not like to trust himself with Johnson.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">The conversation presently turned upon the <span class="t8">Beggar&rsquo;s Opera</span>, and Johnson sensibly refused to believe that any man had been made a rogue by seeing it. Yet the moralist felt bound to utter some condemnation of such a performance, and at last, amidst the smothered amusement of the company, collected himself to give a heavy stroke: &ldquo;there is in it,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;such a <span class="t8">labefactation</span> of all principles as may he dangerous to morality.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">A discussion followed as to whether Sheridan was right for refusing to allow his wife to continue as a public singer. Johnson defended him &ldquo;with all the high spirit of a Roman senator.&rdquo; &ldquo;He resolved wisely and nobly, to be sure. He is a brave man. Would not a gentleman be disgraced by having his wife sing publicly for hire? No, sir, there can be no doubt here. I know not if I should not prepare myself for a public singer as readily as let my wife be one.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">The stout old supporter of social authority went on to denounce the politics of the day. He asserted that politics had come to mean nothing but the art of rising in the world. He contrasted the absence of any principles with the state of the national mind during the stormy days of the seventeenth century. This gives the pith of Johnston&rsquo;s political prejudices. He hated Whigs blindly from his cradle; but he justified his hatred on the ground that they were now all &ldquo;bottomless Whigs,&rdquo; that is to say, that pierce where you would, you came upon no definite creed, but only upon hollow formulae, intended as a cloak for private interest. If Burke and one or two of his friends be excepted, the remark had but too much justice.</p>
<p class="p24">In 1776, Boswell found Johnson rejoicing in the prospect of a journey to Italy with the Thrales. Before starting he was to take a trip to the country, in which Boswell agreed to join. Boswell gathered up various bits of advice before their departure. One seems to have commended itself to him as specially available for practice. &ldquo;A man who had been drinking freely,&rdquo; said the moralist, &ldquo;should never go into a new company. He would probably strike them as ridiculous, though he might be in unison with those who had been drinking with him.&rdquo; Johnson propounded another favourite theory. &ldquo;A ship,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;was worse than a gaol. There is in a gaol better air, better company, better conveniency of every kind; and a ship has the additional disadvantage of being in danger.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On March 19th, they went by coach to the Angel at Oxford; and next morning visited the Master of University College, who chose with Boswell to act in opposition to a very sound bit of advice given by Johnson soon afterwards &mdash; perhaps with some reference to the proceeding. &ldquo;Never speak of a man in his own presence; it is always indelicate and may be offensive.&rdquo; The two, however, discussed Johnson without reserve. The Master said that he would have given Johnson a hundred pounds for a discourse on the British Constitution; and Boswell suggested that Johnson should write two volumes of no great bulk upon Church and State, which should comprise the whole substance of the argument. &ldquo;He should erect a fort on the confines of each.&rdquo; Johnson was not unnaturally displeased with the dialogue, and growled out, &ldquo;Why should I be always writing?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Presently, they went to see Dr. Adams, the doctor&rsquo;s old friend, who had been answering Hume. Boswell, who had done his best to court the acquaintance of Voltaire, Rousseau, Wilkes, and Hume himself, felt it desirable to reprove Adams for having met Hume with civility. He aired his admirable sentiments in a long speech, observing upon the connexion between theory and practice, and remarking, by way of practical application, that, if an infidel were at once vain and ugly, he might be compared to &ldquo;Cicero&rsquo;s beautiful image of Virtue&rdquo; &mdash; which would, as he seems to think, be a crushing retort. Boswell always delighted in fighting with his gigantic backer close behind him. Johnson, as he had doubtless expected, chimed in with the argument. &ldquo;You should do your best,&rdquo; said Johnson, &ldquo;to diminish the authority, as well as dispute the arguments of your adversary, because most people are biased more by personal respect than by reasoning.&rdquo; &ldquo;You would not jostle a chimney-sweeper,&rdquo; said Adams. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Johnson, &ldquo;if it were necessary to jostle him down.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">The pair proceeded by post-chaise past Blenheim, and dined at a good inn at Chapelhouse. Johnston boasted of the superiority, long since vanished if it ever existed, of English to French inns, and quoted with great emotion Shenstone&rsquo;s lines &mdash; </p>
<p class="p26">&nbsp;Whoe&rsquo;er has travell&rsquo;d life&rsquo;s dull round,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where&rsquo;er his stages may have been,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Must sigh to think he still has found<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warmest welcome at an inn.</p>
<p class="p24">As they drove along rapidly in the post-chaise, he exclaimed, &ldquo;Life has not many better things than this.&rdquo; On another occasion he said that he should like to spend his life driving briskly in a post-chaise with a pretty woman, clever enough to add to the conversation. The pleasure was partly owing to the fact that his deafness was less troublesome in a carriage. But he admitted that there were drawbacks even to this pleasure. Boswell asked him whether he would not add a post-chaise journey to the other sole cause of happiness &mdash; namely, drunkenness. &ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; said Johnson, &ldquo;you are driving rapidly <span class="t8">from</span> something or <span class="t8">to</span> something.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">They went to Birmingham, where Boswell pumped Hector about Johnson&rsquo;s early days, and saw the works of Boulton, Watt&rsquo;s partner, who said to him, &ldquo;I sell here, sir, what all the world desires to have &mdash; <span class="t8">power</span>.&rdquo; Thence they went to Lichfield, and met more of the rapidly thinning circle of Johnson&rsquo;s oldest friends. Here Boswell was a little scandalized by Johnson&rsquo;s warm exclamation on opening a letter&mdash; &ldquo;One of the most dreadful things that has happened in my time!&rdquo; This turned out to be the death of Thrale&rsquo;s only son. Boswell thought the phrase too big for the event, and was some time before he could feel a proper concern. He was, however, &ldquo;curious to observe how Dr. Johnson would be affected,&rdquo; and was again a little scandalized by the reply to his consolatory remark that the Thrales still had daughters. &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said Johnson, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you know how you yourself think? Sir, he wishes to propagate his name.&rdquo; The great man was actually putting the family sentiment of a brewer in the same category with the sentiments of the heir of Auchinleck. Johnson, however, calmed down, but resolved to hurry back to London. They stayed a night at Taylor&rsquo;s, who remarked that he had fought a good many battles for a physician, one of their common friends. &ldquo;But you should consider, sir,&rdquo; said Johnson, &ldquo;that by every one of your victories he is a loser; for every man of whom you get the better will be very angry, and resolve not to employ him, whereas if people get the better of you in argument about him, they will think &lsquo;We&rsquo;ll send for Dr. &mdash;&mdash; nevertheless!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">It was after their return to London that Boswell won the greatest triumph of his friendship. He carried through a negotiation, to which, as Burke pleasantly said, there was nothing equal in the whole history of the <span class="t8">corps diplomatique</span>. At some moment of enthusiasm it had occurred to him to bring Johnson into company with Wilkes. The infidel demagogue was probably in the mind of the Tory High Churchman, when he threw out that pleasant little apophthegm about patriotism. To bring together two such opposites without provoking a collision would be the crowning triumph of Boswell&rsquo;s curiosity. He was ready to run all hazards as a chemist might try some new experiment at the risk of a destructive explosion; but being resolved, he took every precaution with admirable foresight.</p>
<p class="p24">Boswell had been invited by the Dillys, well-known booksellers of the day, to meet Wilkes. &ldquo;Let us have Johnson,&rdquo; suggested the gallant Boswell. &ldquo;Not for the world!&rdquo; exclaimed Dilly. But, on Boswell&rsquo;s undertaking the negotiation, he consented to the experiment. Boswell went off to Johnson and politely invited him in Dilly&rsquo;s name. &ldquo;I will wait upon him,&rdquo; said Johnson. &ldquo;Provided, sir, I suppose,&rdquo; said the diplomatic Boswell, &ldquo;that the company which he is to have is agreeable to you.&rdquo; &ldquo;What do you mean, sir?&rdquo; exclaimed Johnson. &ldquo;What do you take me for? Do you think I am so ignorant of the world as to prescribe to a gentleman what company he is to have at his table?&rdquo; Boswell worked the point a little farther, till, by judicious manipulation, he had got Johnson to commit himself to meeting anybody &mdash; even Jack Wilkes, to make a wild hypothesis &mdash; at the Dillys&rsquo; table. Boswell retired, hoping to think that he had fixed the discussion in Johnson&rsquo;s mind.</p>
<p class="p24">The great day arrived, and Boswell, like a consummate general who leaves nothing to chance, went himself to fetch Johnson to the dinner. The great man had forgotten the engagement, and was &ldquo;buffeting his books&rdquo; in a dirty shirt and amidst clouds of dust. When reminded of his promise, he said that he had ordered dinner at home with Mrs. Williams. Entreaties of the warmest kind from Boswell softened the peevish old lady, to whose pleasure Johnson had referred him. Boswell flew back, announced Mrs. Williams&rsquo;s consent, and Johnson roared, &ldquo;Frank, a clean shirt!&rdquo; and was soon in a hackney-coach. Boswell rejoiced like a &ldquo;fortune-hunter who has got an heiress into a post-chaise with him to set out for Gretna Green.&rdquo; Yet the joy was with trembling. Arrived at Dillys&rsquo;, Johnson found himself amongst strangers, and Boswell watched anxiously from a corner. &ldquo;Who is that gentleman?&rdquo; whispered Johnson to Dilly. &ldquo;Mr. Arthur Lee.&rdquo; Johnson whistled &ldquo;too-too-too&rdquo; doubtfully, for Lee was a patriot and an American. &ldquo;And who is the gentleman in lace?&rdquo; &ldquo;Mr. Wilkes, sir.&rdquo; Johnson subsided into a window-seat and fixed his eye on a book. He was fairly in the toils. His reproof of Boswell was recent enough to prevent him from exhibiting his displeasure, and he resolved to restrain himself.</p>
<p class="p24">At dinner Wilkes, placed next to Johnson, took up his part in the performance. He pacified the sturdy moralist by delicate attentions to his needs. He helped him carefully to some fine veal. &ldquo;Pray give me leave, sir; it is better here &mdash; a little of the brown &mdash; some fat, sir &mdash; a little of the stuffing &mdash; some gravy &mdash; let me have the pleasure of giving you some butter. Allow me to recommend a squeeze of this orange; or the lemon, perhaps, may have more zest.&rdquo; &ldquo;Sir, sir,&rdquo; cried Johnson, &ldquo;I am obliged to you, sir,&rdquo; bowing and turning to him, with a look for some time of &ldquo;surly virtue,&rdquo; and soon of complacency.</p>
<p class="p24">Gradually the conversation became cordial. Johnson told of the fascination exercised by Foote, who, like Wilkes, had succeeded in pleasing him against his will. Foote once took to selling beer, and it was so bad that the servants of Fitzherbert, one of his customers, resolved to protest. They chose a little black boy to carry their remonstrance; but the boy waited at table one day when Foote was present, and returning to his companions, said, &ldquo;This is the finest man I have ever seen. I will not deliver your message; I will drink his beer.&rdquo; From Foote the transition was easy to Garrick, whom Johnson, as usual, defended against the attacks of others. He maintained that Garrick&rsquo;s reputation for avarice, though unfounded, had been rather useful than otherwise. &ldquo;You despise a man for avarice, but you do not hate him.&rdquo; The clamour would have been more effectual, had it been directed against his living with splendour too great for a player. Johnson went on to speak of the difficulty of getting biographical information. When he had wished to write a life of Dryden, he applied to two living men who remembered him. One could only tell him that Dryden had a chair by the fire at Will&rsquo;s Coffee-house in winter, which was moved to the balcony in summer. The other (Cibber) could only report that he remembered Dryden as a &ldquo;decent old man, arbiter of critical disputes at Will&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson and Wilkes had one point in common &mdash; a vigorous prejudice against the Scotch, and upon this topic they cracked their jokes in friendly emulation. When they met upon a later occasion (1781), they still pursued this inexhaustible subject. Wilkes told how a privateer had completely plundered seven Scotch islands, and re-embarked with three and sixpence. Johnson now remarked in answer to somebody who said &ldquo;Poor old England is lost!&rdquo; &ldquo;Sir, it is not so much to be lamented that old England is lost, as that the Scotch have found it.&rdquo; &ldquo;You must know, sir,&rdquo; he said to Wilkes, &ldquo;that I lately took my friend Boswell and showed him genuine civilized life in an English provincial town. I turned him loose at Lichfield, that he might see for once real civility, for you know he lives among savages in Scotland and among rakes in London.&rdquo; &ldquo;Except,&rdquo; said Wilkes, &ldquo;when he is with grave, sober, decent people like you and me.&rdquo; &ldquo;And we ashamed of him,&rdquo; added Johnson, smiling.</p>
<p class="p24">Boswell had to bear some jokes against himself and his countrymen from the pair; but he had triumphed, and rejoiced greatly when he went home with Johnson, and heard the great man speak of his pleasant dinner to Mrs. Williams. Johnson seems to have been permanently reconciled to his foe. &ldquo;Did we not hear so much said of Jack Wilkes,&rdquo; he remarked next year, &ldquo;we should think more highly of his conversation. Jack has a great variety of talk, Jack is a scholar, and Jack has the manners of a gentleman. But, after hearing his name sounded from pole to pole as the phoenix of convivial felicity, we are disappointed in his company. He has always been at <span class="t8">me</span>, but I would do Jack a kindness rather than not. The contest is now over.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">In fact, Wilkes had ceased to play any part in public life. When Johnson met him next (in 1781) they joked about such dangerous topics as some of Wilkes&rsquo;s political performances. Johnson sent him a copy of the <span class="t8">Lives</span>, and they were seen conversing <span class="t8">tête-à-tête</span> in confidential whispers about George II. and the King of Prussia. To Boswell&rsquo;s mind it suggested the happy days when the lion should lie down with the kid, or, as Dr. Barnard suggested, the goat.</p>
<p class="p24">In the year 1777 Johnson began the <span class="t8">Lives of the Poets</span>, in compliance with a request from the booksellers, who wished for prefaces to a large collection of English poetry. Johnson asked for this work the extremely modest sum of 200 guineas, when he might easily, according to Malone, have received 1000 or 1500. He did not meet Boswell till September, when they spent ten days together at Dr. Taylor&rsquo;s. The subject which specially interested Boswell at this time was the fate of the unlucky Dr. Dodd, hanged for forgery in the previous June. Dodd seems to have been a worthless charlatan of the popular preacher variety. His crime would not in our days have been thought worthy of so severe a punishment; but his contemporaries were less shocked by the fact of death being inflicted for such a fault, than by the fact of its being inflicted on a clergyman. Johnson exerted himself to procure a remission of the sentence by writing various letters and petitions on Dodd&rsquo;s behalf. He seems to have been deeply moved by the man&rsquo;s appeal, and could &ldquo;not bear the thought&rdquo; that any negligence of his should lead to the death of a fellow-creature; but he said that if he had himself been in authority he would have signed the death-warrant, and for the man himself, he had as little respect as might be. He said, indeed, that Dodd was right in not joining in the &ldquo;cant&rdquo; about leaving a wretched world. &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said the poor rogue, &ldquo;it has been a very agreeable world to me.&rdquo; Dodd had allowed to pass for his own one of the papers composed for him by Johnson, and the Doctor was not quite pleased. When, however, Seward expressed a doubt as to Dodd&rsquo;s power of writing so forcibly, Johnson felt bound not to expose him. &ldquo;Why should you think so? Depend upon it, sir, when any man knows he is to be hanged in a fortnight, it concentrates his mind wonderfully.&rdquo; On another occasion, Johnson expressed a doubt himself as to whether Dodd had really composed a certain prayer on the night before his execution. &ldquo;Sir, do you think that a man the night before he is to be hanged cares for the succession of the royal family? Though he <span class="t8">may</span> have composed this prayer then. A man who has been canting all his life may cant to the last; and yet a man who has been refused a pardon after so much petitioning, would hardly be praying thus fervently for the king.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">The last day at Taylor&rsquo;s was characteristic. Johnson was very cordial to his disciple, and Boswell fancied that he could defend his master at &ldquo;the point of his sword.&rdquo; &ldquo;My regard for you,&rdquo; said Johnson, &ldquo;is greater almost than I have words to express, but I do not choose to be always repeating it. Write it down in the first leaf of your pocket-book, and never doubt of it again.&rdquo; They became sentimental, and talked of the misery of human life. Boswell spoke of the pleasures of society. &ldquo;Alas, sir,&rdquo; replied Johnson, like a true pessimist, &ldquo;these are only struggles for happiness!&rdquo; He felt exhilarated, he said, when he first went to Ranelagh, but he changed to the mood of Xerxes weeping at the sight of his army. &ldquo;It went to my heart to consider that there was not one in all that brilliant circle that was not afraid to go home and think; but that the thoughts of each individual would be distressing when alone.&rdquo; Some years before he had gone with Boswell to the Pantheon and taken a more cheerful view. When Boswell doubted whether there were many happy people present, he said, &ldquo;Yes, sir, there are many happy people here. There are many people here who are watching hundreds, and who think hundreds are watching them.&rdquo; The more permanent feeling was that which he expressed in the &ldquo;serene autumn night&rdquo; in Taylor&rsquo;s garden. He was willing, however, to talk calmly about eternal punishment, and to admit the possibility of a &ldquo;mitigated interpretation.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">After supper he dictated to Boswell an argument in favour of the negro who was then claiming his liberty in Scotland. He hated slavery with a zeal which the excellent Boswell thought to be &ldquo;without knowledge;&rdquo; and on one occasion gave as a toast to some &ldquo;very grave men&rdquo; at Oxford, &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s to the next insurrection of negroes in the West Indies.&rdquo; The hatred was combined with as hearty a dislike for American independence. &ldquo;How is it,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that we always hear the loudest yelps for liberty amongst the drivers of negroes?&rdquo; The harmony of the evening was unluckily spoilt by an explosion of this prejudice. Boswell undertook the defence of the colonists, and the discussion became so fierce that though Johnson had expressed a willingness to sit up all night with him, they were glad to part after an hour or two, and go to bed.</p>
<p class="p24">In 1778, Boswell came to London and found Johnson absorbed, to an extent which apparently excited his jealousy, by his intimacy with the Thrales. They had, however, several agreeable meetings. One was at the club, and Boswell&rsquo;s report of the conversation is the fullest that we have of any of its meetings. A certain reserve is indicated by his using initials for the interlocutors, of whom, however, one can be easily identified as Burke. The talk began by a discussion of an antique statue, said to be the dog of Alcibiades, and valued at 1000<span class="t8">l</span>. Burke said that the representation of no animal could be worth so much. Johnson, whose taste for art was a vanishing quantity, said that the value was proportional to the difficulty. A statue, as he argued on another occasion, would be worth nothing if it were cut out of a carrot. Everything, he now said, was valuable which &ldquo;enlarged the sphere of human powers.&rdquo; The first man who balanced a straw upon his nose, or rode upon three horses at once, deserved the applause of mankind; and so statues of animals should be preserved as a proof of dexterity, though men should not continue such fruitless labours.</p>
<p class="p24">The conversation became more instructive under the guidance of Burke. He maintained what seemed to his hearers a paradox, though it would be interesting to hear his arguments from some profounder economist than Boswell, that a country would be made more populous by emigration. &ldquo;There are bulls enough in Ireland,&rdquo; he remarked incidentally in the course of the argument. &ldquo;So, sir, I should think from your argument,&rdquo; said Johnson, for once condescending to an irresistible pun. It is recorded, too, that he once made a bull himself, observing that a horse was so slow that when it went up hill, it stood still. If he now failed to appreciate Burke&rsquo;s argument, he made one good remark. Another speaker said that unhealthy countries were the most populous. &ldquo;Countries which are the most populous,&rdquo; replied Johnson, &ldquo;have the most destructive diseases. That is the true state of the proposition;&rdquo; and indeed, the remark applies to the case of emigration.</p>
<p class="p24">A discussion then took place as to whether it would be worth while for Burke to take so much trouble with speeches which never decided a vote. Burke replied that a speech, though it did not gain one vote, would have an influence, and maintained that the House of Commons was not wholly corrupt. &ldquo;We are all more or less governed by interest,&rdquo; was Johnson&rsquo;s comment. &ldquo;But interest will not do everything. In a case which admits of doubt, we try to think on the side which is for our interest, and generally bring ourselves to act accordingly. But the subject must admit of diversity of colouring; it must receive a colour on that side. In the House of Commons there are members enough who will not vote what is grossly absurd and unjust. No, sir, there must always be right enough, or appearance of right, to keep wrong in countenance.&rdquo; After some deviations, the conversation returned to this point. Johnson and Burke agreed on a characteristic statement. Burke said that from his experience he had learnt to think better of mankind. &ldquo;From my experience,&rdquo; replied Johnson, &ldquo;I have found them worse on commercial dealings, more disposed to cheat than I had any notion of; but more disposed to do one another good than I had conceived.&rdquo; &ldquo;Less just, and more beneficent,&rdquo; as another speaker suggested. Johnson proceeded to say that considering the pressure of want, it was wonderful that men would do so much for each other. The greatest liar is said to speak more truth than falsehood, and perhaps the worst man might do more good than not. But when Boswell suggested that perhaps experience might increase our estimate of human happiness, Johnson returned to his habitual pessimism. &ldquo;No, sir, the more we inquire, the more we shall find men less happy.&rdquo; The talk soon wandered off into a disquisition upon the folly of deliberately testing the strength of our friend&rsquo;s affection.</p>
<p class="p24">The evening ended by Johnson accepting a commission to write to a friend who had given to the Club a hogshead of claret, and to request another, with &ldquo;a happy ambiguity of expression,&rdquo; in the hopes that it might also be a present.</p>
<p class="p24">Some days afterwards, another conversation took place, which has a certain celebrity in Boswellian literature. The scene was at Dilly&rsquo;s, and the guests included Miss Seward and Mrs. Knowles, a well-known Quaker Lady. Before dinner Johnson seized upon a book which he kept in his lap during dinner, wrapped up in the table-cloth. His attention was not distracted from the various business of the hour, but he hit upon a topic which happily combined the two appropriate veins of thought. He boasted that he would write a cookery-book upon philosophical principles; and declared in opposition to Miss Seward that such a task was beyond the sphere of woman. Perhaps this led to a discussion upon the privileges of men, in which Johnson put down Mrs. Knowles, who had some hankering for women&rsquo;s rights, by the Shakspearian maxim that if two men ride on a horse, one must ride behind. Driven from her position in this world, poor Mrs. Knowles hoped that sexes might be equal in the next. Boswell reproved her by the remark already quoted, that men might as well expect to be equal to angels. He enforces this view by an illustration suggested by the &ldquo;Rev. Mr. Brown of Utrecht,&rdquo; who had observed that a great or small glass might be equally full, though not holding equal quantities. Mr. Brown intended this for a confutation of Hume, who has said that a little Miss, dressed for a ball, may be as happy as an orator who has won some triumphant success.</p>
<p class="p26">[Footnote 1: Boswell remarks as a curious coincidence that the same<br/>illustration had been used by a Dr. King, a dissenting minister.<br/>Doubtless it has been used often enough. For one instance see <span class="t8">Donne&rsquo;s<br/>Sermons</span> (Alford&rsquo;s Edition), vol. i., p. 5.]</p>
<p class="p24">The conversation thus took a theological turn, and Mrs. Knowles was fortunate enough to win Johnson&rsquo;s high approval. He defended a doctrine maintained by Soame Jenyns, that friendship is a Christian virtue. Mrs. Knowles remarked that Jesus had twelve disciples, but there was <span class="t8">one</span> whom he <span class="t8">loved</span>. Johnson, &ldquo;with eyes sparkling benignantly,&rdquo; exclaimed, &ldquo;Very well indeed, madam; you have said very well!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">So far all had gone smoothly; but here, for some inexplicable reason, Johnson burst into a sudden fury against the American rebels, whom he described as &ldquo;rascals, robbers, pirates,&rdquo; and roared out a tremendous volley, which might almost have been audible across the Atlantic. Boswell sat and trembled, but gradually diverted the sage to less exciting topics. The name of Jonathan Edwards suggested a discussion upon free will and necessity, upon which poor Boswell was much given to worry himself. Some time afterwards Johnson wrote to him, in answer to one of his lamentations: &ldquo;I hoped you had got rid of all this hypocrisy of misery. What have you to do with liberty and necessity? Or what more than to hold your tongue about it?&rdquo; Boswell could never take this sensible advice; but he got little comfort from his oracle. &ldquo;We know that we are all free, and there&rsquo;s an end on&rsquo;t,&rdquo; was his statement on one occasion, and now he could only say, &ldquo;All theory is against the freedom of the will, and all experience for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Some familiar topics followed, which play a great part in Boswell&rsquo;s reports. Among the favourite topics of the sentimentalists of the day was the denunciation of &ldquo;luxury,&rdquo; and of civilized life in general. There was a disposition to find in the South Sea savages or American Indians an embodiment of the fancied state of nature. Johnson heartily despised the affectation. He was told of an American woman who had to be bound in order to keep her from savage life. &ldquo;She must have been an animal, a beast,&rdquo; said Boswell. &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said Johnson, &ldquo;she was a speaking cat.&rdquo; Somebody quoted to him with admiration the soliloquy of an officer who had lived in the wilds of America: &ldquo;Here am I, free and unrestrained, amidst the rude magnificence of nature, with the Indian woman by my side, and this gun, with which I can procure food when I want it! What more can be desired for human happiness?&rdquo; &ldquo;Do not allow yourself, sir,&rdquo; replied Johnson, &ldquo;to be imposed upon by such gross absurdity. It is sad stuff; it is brutish. If a bull could speak, he might as well exclaim, &lsquo;Here am I with this cow and this grass; what being can enjoy greater felicity?&rsquo;&rdquo; When Johnson implored Boswell to &ldquo;clear his mind of cant,&rdquo; he was attacking his disciple for affecting a serious depression about public affairs; but the cant which he hated would certainly have included as its first article an admiration for the state of nature.</p>
<p class="p24">On the present occasion Johnson defended luxury, and said that he had learnt much from Mandeville &mdash; a shrewd cynic, in whom Johnson&rsquo;s hatred for humbug is exaggerated into a general disbelief in real as well as sham nobleness of sentiment. As the conversation proceeded, Johnson expressed his habitual horror of death, and caused Miss Seward&rsquo;s ridicule by talking seriously of ghosts and the importance of the question of their reality; and then followed an explosion, which seems to have closed this characteristic evening. A young woman had become a Quaker under the influence of Mrs. Knowles, who now proceeded to deprecate Johnson&rsquo;s wrath at what he regarded as an apostasy. &ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;she is an odious wench,&rdquo; and he proceeded to denounce her audacity in presuming to choose a religion for herself. &ldquo;She knew no more of the points of difference,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;than of the difference between the Copernican and Ptolemaic systems.&rdquo; When Mrs. Knowles said that she had the New Testament before her, he said that it was the &ldquo;most difficult book in the world,&rdquo; and he proceeded to attack the unlucky proselyte with a fury which shocked the two ladies. Mrs. Knowles afterwards published a report of this conversation, and obtained another report, with which, however, she was not satisfied, from Miss Seward. Both of them represent the poor doctor as hopelessly confuted by the mild dignity and calm reason of Mrs. Knowles, though the triumph is painted in far the brightest colours by Mrs. Knowles herself. Unluckily, there is not a trace of Johnson&rsquo;s manner, except in one phrase, in either report, and they are chiefly curious as an indirect testimony to Boswell&rsquo;s superior powers. The passage, in which both the ladies agree, is that Johnson, on the expression of Mrs. Knowles&rsquo;s hope that he would meet the young lady in another world, retorted that he was not fond of meeting fools anywhere.</p>
<p class="p24">Poor Boswell was at this time a water-drinker by Johnson&rsquo;s recommendation, though unluckily for himself he never broke off his drinking habits for long. They had a conversation at Paoli&rsquo;s, in which Boswell argued against his present practice. Johnson remarked &ldquo;that wine gave a man nothing, but only put in motion what had been locked up in frost.&rdquo; It was a key, suggested some one, which opened a box, but the box might be full or empty. &ldquo;Nay, sir,&rdquo; said Johnson, &ldquo;conversation is the key, wine is a picklock, which forces open the box and injures it. A man should cultivate his mind, so as to have that confidence and readiness without wine which wine gives.&rdquo; Boswell characteristically said that the great difficulty was from &ldquo;benevolence.&rdquo; It was hard to refuse &ldquo;a good, worthy man&rdquo; who asked you to try his cellar. This, according to Johnson, was mere conceit, implying an exaggerated estimate of your importance to your entertainer. Reynolds gallantly took up the opposite side, and produced the one recorded instance of a Johnsonian blush. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t argue any more with you, sir,&rdquo; said Johnson, who thought every man to be elevated who drank wine, &ldquo;you are too far gone.&rdquo; &ldquo;I should have thought so indeed, sir, had I made such a speech as you have now done,&rdquo; said Reynolds; and Johnson apologized with the aforesaid blush.</p>
<p class="p24">The explosion was soon over on this occasion. Not long afterwards, Johnson attacked Boswell so fiercely at a dinner at Reynolds&rsquo;s, that the poor disciple kept away for a week. They made it up when they met next, and Johnson solaced Boswell&rsquo;s wounded vanity by highly commending an image made by him to express his feelings. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care how often or how high Johnson tosses me, when only friends are present, for then I fall upon soft ground; but I do not like falling on stones, which is the case when enemies are present.&rdquo; The phrase may recall one of Johnson&rsquo;s happiest illustrations. When some one said in his presence that a <span class="t8">congé d&rsquo;élire</span> might be considered as only a strong recommendation: &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; replied Johnson, &ldquo;it is such a recommendation as if I should throw you out of a two-pair of stairs window, and recommend you to fall soft.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">It is perhaps time to cease these extracts from Boswell&rsquo;s reports. The next two years were less fruitful. In 1779 Boswell was careless, though twice in London, and in 1780, he did not pay his annual visit. Boswell has partly filled up the gap by a collection of sayings made by Langton, some passages from which have been quoted, and his correspondence gives various details. Garrick died in January of 1779, and Beauclerk in March, 1780. Johnson himself seems to have shown few symptoms of increasing age; but a change was approaching, and the last years of his life were destined to be clouded, not merely by physical weakness, but by a change of circumstances which had great influence upon his happiness.</p>
