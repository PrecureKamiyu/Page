<p class="p24">We went to the drawing-room, where was a considerable increase of company. Several of us got round Dr. Johnson, and complained that he would not give us an exact catalogue of his works, that there might be a complete edition. He smiled, and evaded our entreaties. That he intended to do it, I have no doubt, because I have heard him say so; and I have in my possession an imperfect list, fairly written out, which he entitles Historia Studiorum. I once got from one of his friends a list, which there was pretty good reason to suppose was accurate, for it was written down in his presence by this friend, who enumerated each article aloud, and had some of them mentioned to him by Mr. Levett, in concert with whom it was made out; and Johnson, who heard all this, did not contradict it. But when I shewed a copy of this list to him, and mentioned the evidence for its exactness, he laughed, and said, &lsquo;I was willing to let them go on as they pleased, and never interfered.&rsquo; Upon which I read it to him, article by article, and got him positively to own or refuse; and then, having obtained certainty so far, I got some other articles confirmed by him directly; and afterwards, from time to time, made additions under his sanction.</p>
<p class="p24">The conversation having turned on Bon-Mots, be quoted, from one of the Ana, an exquisite instance of flattery in a maid of honour in France, who being asked by the Queen what o&rsquo;clock it was, answered, &lsquo;What your Majesty pleases.&rsquo; He admitted that Mr. Burke&rsquo;s classical pun upon Mr. Wilkes&rsquo;s being carried on the shoulders of the mob, &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo; &mdash;&mdash;&nbsp; &mdash;&mdash;&nbsp; &mdash;&mdash; Numerisque fertur</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lege solutus,&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">was admirable; and though he was strangely unwilling to allow to that extraordinary man the talent of wit, he also laughed with approbation at another of his playful conceits; which was, that &lsquo;Horace has in one line given a description of a good desirable manour: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&ldquo;Est modus in rebus, sunt certi denique fines;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">that is to say, a modus as to the tithes and certain fines.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He observed, &lsquo;A man cannot with propriety speak of himself, except he relates simple facts; as, &ldquo;I was at Richmond:&rdquo; or what depends on mensuration; as, &ldquo;I am six feet high.&rdquo; He is sure he has been at Richmond; he is sure he is six feet high: but he cannot be sure he is wise, or that he has any other excellence. Then, all censure of a man&rsquo;s self is oblique praise. It is in order to shew how much he can spare. It has all the invidiousness of self-praise, and all the reproach of falsehood.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Tuesday, April 28, he was engaged to dine at General Paoli&rsquo;s, where, as I have already observed, I was still entertained in elegant hospitality, and with all the ease and comfort of a home. I called on him, and accompanied him in a hackney-coach. We stopped first at the bottom of Hedgelane, into which he went to leave a letter, &lsquo;with good news for a poor man in distress,&rsquo; as he told me. I did not question him particularly as to this. He himself often resembled Lady Bolingbroke&rsquo;s Lively description of Pope; that &lsquo;he was un politique aux choux et aux raves.&rsquo; He would say, &lsquo;I dine to-day in Grosvenor-square;&rsquo; this might be with a Duke: or, perhaps, &lsquo;I dine to-day at the other end of the town:&rsquo; or, &lsquo;A gentleman of great eminence called on me yesterday.&rsquo; He loved thus to keep things floating in conjecture: Omne ignotum pro magnifico est. I believe I ventured to dissipate the cloud, to unveil the mystery, more freely and frequently than any of his friends. We stopped again at Wirgman&rsquo;s, the well-known toy-shop, in St. James&rsquo;s-street, at the corner of St. James&rsquo;s-place, to which he had been directed, but not clearly, for he searched about some time, and could not find it at first; and said, &lsquo;To direct one only to a corner shop is TOYING with one.&rsquo; I suppose he meant this as a play upon the word toy: it was the first time that I knew him stoop to such sport. After he had been some time in the shop, he sent for me to come out of the coach, and help him to choose a pair of silver buckles, as those he had were too small. Probably this alteration in dress had been suggested by Mrs. Thrale, by associating with whom, his external appearance was much improved. He got better cloaths; and the dark colour, from which he never deviated, was enlivened by metal buttons. His wigs, too, were much better; and during their travels in France, he was furnished with a Paris-made wig, of handsome construction. This choosing of silver buckles was a negociation: &lsquo;Sir, (said he,) I will not have the ridiculous large ones now in fashion; and I will give no more than a guinea for a pair.&rsquo; Such were the PRINCIPLES of the business; and, after some examination, he was fitted. As we drove along, I found him in a talking humour, of which I availed myself. BOSWELL. &lsquo;I was this morning in Ridley&rsquo;s shop, Sir; and was told, that the collection called Johnsoniana has sold very much.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Yet the Journey to the Hebrides has not had a great sale.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;That is strange.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Yes, Sir; for in that book I have told the world a great deal that they did not know before.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">BOSWELL. &lsquo;I drank chocolate, Sir, this morning with Mr. Eld; and, to my no small surprize, found him to be a Staffordshire Whig, a being which I did not believe had existed.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, there are rascals in all countries.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Eld said, a Tory was a creature generated between a non-juring parson and one&rsquo;s grandmother.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;And I have always said, the first Whig was the Devil.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;He certainly was, Sir. The Devil was impatient of subordination; he was the first who resisted power: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&ldquo;Better to reign in Hell, than serve in Heaven.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">At General Paoli&rsquo;s were Sir Joshua Reynolds, Mr. Langton, Marchese Gherardi of Lombardy, and Mr. John Spottiswoode the younger, of Spottiswoode, the solicitor.</p>
<p class="p24">We talked of drinking wine. JOHNSON. &lsquo;I require wine only when I am alone. I have then often wished for it, and often taken it.&rsquo; SPOTTISWOODE. &lsquo;What, by way of a companion, Sir?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;To get rid of myself, to send myself away. Wine gives great pleasure; and every pleasure is of itself a good. It is a good, unless counterbalanced by evil. A man may have a strong reason not to drink wine; and that may be greater than the pleasure. Wine makes a man better pleased with himself. I do not say that it makes him more pleasing to others. Sometimes it does. But the danger is, that while a man grows better pleased with himself, he may be growing less pleasing to others. Wine gives a man nothing. It neither gives him knowledge nor wit; it only animates a man, and enables him to bring out what a dread of the company had repressed. It only puts in motion what has been locked up in frost. But this may be good, or it may be bad.&rsquo; SPOTTISWOODE. &lsquo;So, Sir, wine is a key which opens a box; but this box may be either full or empty.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Nay, Sir, conversation is the key: wine is a pick-lock, which forces open the box and injures it. A man should cultivate his mind so as to have that confidence and readiness without wine, which wine gives.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;The great difficulty of resisting wine is from benevolence. For instance, a good worthy man asks you to taste his wine, which he has had twenty years in his cellar.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, all this notion about benevolence arises from a man&rsquo;s imagining himself to be of more importance to others, than he really is. They don&rsquo;t care a farthing whether he drinks wine or not.&rsquo; SIR JOSHUA REYNOLDS. &lsquo;Yes, they do for the time.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;For the time! &mdash; If they care this minute, they forget it the next. And as for the good worthy man; how do you know he is good and worthy? No good and worthy man will insist upon another man&rsquo;s drinking wine. As to the wine twenty years in the cellar, &mdash; of ten men, three say this, merely because they must say something; &mdash; three are telling a lie, when they say they have had the wine twenty years; &mdash; three would rather save the wine; &mdash; one, perhaps, cares. I allow it is something to please one&rsquo;s company: and people are always pleased with those who partake pleasure with them. But after a man has brought himself to relinquish the great personal pleasure which arises from drinking wine, any other consideration is a trifle. To please others by drinking wine, is something only, if there be nothing against it. I should, however, be sorry to offend worthy men: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Curst be the verse, how well so e&rsquo;er it flow,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That tends to make one worthy man my foe.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">BOSWELL. &lsquo;Curst be the SPRING, the WATER.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;But let us consider what a sad thing it would be, if we were obliged to drink or do any thing else that may happen to be agreeable to the company where we are.&rsquo; LANGTON. &lsquo;By the same rule you must join with a gang of cut-purses.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Yes, Sir: but yet we must do justice to wine; we must allow it the power it possesses. To make a man pleased with himself, let me tell you, is doing a very great thing;</p>
<p class="p24">&ldquo;Si patriae volumus, si Nobis vivere cari.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I was at this time myself a water-drinker, upon trial, by Johnson&rsquo;s recommendation. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Boswell is a bolder combatant than Sir Joshua: he argues for wine without the help of wine; but Sir Joshua with it.&rsquo; SIR JOSHUA REYNOLDS. &lsquo;But to please one&rsquo;s company is a strong motive.&rsquo; JOHNSON. (who, from drinking only water, supposed every body who drank wine to be elevated,) &lsquo;I won&rsquo;t argue any more with you, Sir. You are too far gone.&rsquo; SIR JOSHUA. &lsquo;I should have thought so indeed, Sir, had I made such a speech as you have now done.&rsquo; JOHNSON. (drawing himself in, and, I really thought blushing,) &lsquo;Nay, don&rsquo;t be angry. I did not mean to offend you.&rsquo; SIR JOSHUA. &lsquo;At first the taste of wine was disagreeable to me; but I brought myself to drink it, that I might be like other people. The pleasure of drinking wine is so connected with pleasing your company, that altogether there is something of social goodness in it.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, this is only saying the same thing over again.&rsquo; SIR JOSHUA. &lsquo;No, this is new.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;You put it in new words, but it is an old thought. This is one of the disadvantages of wine. It makes a man mistake words for thoughts.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;I think it is a new thought; at least, it is in a new ATTITUDE.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Nay, Sir, it is only in a new coat; or an old coat with a new facing. (Then laughing heartily,) It is the old dog in a new doublet. &mdash; An extraordinary instance however may occur where a man&rsquo;s patron will do nothing for him, unless he will drink: THERE may be a good reason for drinking.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I mentioned a nobleman, who I believed was really uneasy if his company would not drink hard. JOHNSON. &lsquo;That is from having had people about him whom he has been accustomed to command.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Supposing I should be tete-a-tete with him at table.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, there is no more reason for your drinking with HIM, than his being sober with YOU.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Why, that is true; for it would do him less hurt to be sober, than it would do me to get drunk.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Yes, Sir; and from what I have heard of him, one would not wish to sacrifice himself to such a man. If he must always have somebody to drink with him, he should buy a slave, and then he would be sure to have it. They who submit to drink as another pleases, make themselves his slaves.&rsquo; Boswell. &lsquo;But, Sir, you will surely make allowance for the duty of hospitality. A gentleman who loves drinking, comes to visit me.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, a man knows whom he visits; he comes to the table of a sober man.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;But, Sir, you and I should not have been so well received in the Highlands and Hebrides, if I had not drunk with our worthy friends. Had I drunk water only as you did, they would not have been so cordial.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir William Temple mentions that in his travels through the Netherlands he had two or three gentlemen with him; and when a bumper was necessary, he put it on THEM. Were I to travel again through the islands, I would have Sir Joshua with me to take the bumpers.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;But, Sir, let me put a case. Suppose Sir Joshua should take a jaunt into Scotland; he does me the honour to pay me a visit at my house in the country; I am overjoyed at seeing him; we are quite by ourselves, shall I unsociably and churlishly let him sit drinking by himself? No, no, my dear Sir Joshua, you shall not be treated so, I WILL take a bottle with you.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Wednesday, April 29, I dined with him at Mr. Allan Ramsay&rsquo;s, where were Lord Binning, Dr. Robertson the historian, Sir Joshua Reynolds, and the Honourable Mrs. Boscawen, widow of the Admiral, and mother of the present Viscount Falmouth; of whom, if it be not presumptuous in me to praise her, I would say, that her manners are the most agreeable, and her conversation the best, of any lady with whom I ever had the happiness to be acquainted. Before Johnson came we talked a good deal of him; Ramsay said he had always found him a very polite man, and that he treated him with great respect, which he did very sincerely. I said I worshipped him. ROBERTSON. &lsquo;But some of you spoil him; you should not worship him; you should worship no man.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;I cannot help worshipping him, he is so much superiour to other men.&rsquo; ROBERTSON. In criticism, and in wit in conversation, he is no doubt very excellent; but in other respects he is not above other men; he will believe any thing, and will strenuously defend the most minute circumstance connected with the Church of England.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Believe me, Doctor, you are much mistaken as to this; for when you talk with him calmly in private, he is very liberal in his way of thinking.&rsquo; ROBERTSON. &lsquo;He and I have been always very gracious; the first time I met him was one evening at Strahan&rsquo;s, when he had just had an unlucky altercation with Adam Smith, to whom he had been so rough, that Strahan, after Smith was gone, had remonstrated with him, and told him that I was coming soon, and that he was uneasy to think that he might behave in the same manner to me. &ldquo;No, no, Sir, (said Johnson,) I warrant you Robertson and I shall do very well.&rdquo; Accordingly he was gentle and good-humoured, and courteous with me the whole evening; and he has been so upon every occasion that we have met since. I have often said (laughing,) that I have been in a great measure indebted to Smith for my good reception.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;His power of reasoning is very strong, and he has a peculiar art of drawing characters, which is as rare as good portrait painting.&rsquo; SIR JOSHUA REYNOLDS. &lsquo;He is undoubtedly admirable in this; but, in order to mark the characters which he draws, he overcharges them, and gives people more than they really have, whether of good or bad.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">No sooner did he, of whom we had been thus talking so easily, arrive, than we were all as quiet as a school upon the entrance of the head-master; and were very soon set down to a table covered with such variety of good things, as contributed not a little to dispose him to be pleased.</p>
<p class="p24">RAMSAY. &lsquo;I am old enough to have been a contemporary of Pope. His poetry was highly admired in his life-time, more a great deal than after his death.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, it has not been less admired since his death; no authours ever had so much fame in their own life-time as Pope and Voltaire; and Pope&rsquo;s poetry has been as much admired since his death as during his life; it has only not been as much talked of, but that is owing to its being now more distant, and people having other writings to talk of. Virgil is less talked of than Pope, and Homer is less talked of than Virgil; but they are not less admired. We must read what the world reads at the moment. It has been maintained that this superfoetation, this teeming of the press in modern times, is prejudicial to good literature, because it obliges us to read so much of what is of inferiour value, in order to be in the fashion; so that better works are neglected for want of time, because a man will have more gratification of his vanity in conversation, from having read modern books, than from having read the best works of antiquity. But it must be considered, that we have now more knowledge generally diffused; all our ladies read now, which is a great extension. Modern writers are the moons of literature; they shine with reflected light, with light borrowed from the ancients. Greece appears to me to be the fountain of knowledge; Rome of elegance.&rsquo; RAMSAY. &lsquo;I suppose Homer&rsquo;s Iliad to be a collection of pieces which had been written before his time. I should like to see a translation of it in poetical prose like the book of Ruth or Job.&rsquo; ROBERTSON. &lsquo;Would you, Dr. Johnson, who are master of the English language, but try your hand upon a part of it.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, you could not read it without the pleasure of verse.</p>
<p class="p24">Dr. Robertson expatiated on the character of a certain nobleman; that he was one of the strongest-minded men that ever lived; that he would sit in company quite sluggish, while there was nothing to call forth his intellectual vigour; but the moment that any important subject was started, for instance, how this country is to be defended against a French invasion, he would rouse himself, and shew his extraordinary talents with the most powerful ability and animation. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Yet this man cut his own throat. The true strong and sound mind is the mind that can embrace equally great things and small. Now I am told the King of Prussia will say to a servant, &ldquo;Bring me a bottle of such a wine, which came in such a year; it lies in such a corner of the cellars.&rdquo; I would have a man great in great things, and elegant in little things.&rsquo; He said to me afterwards, when we were by ourselves, &lsquo;Robertson was in a mighty romantick humour, he talked of one whom he did not know; but I DOWNED him with the King of Prussia.&rsquo; &lsquo;Yes, Sir, (said I,) you threw a BOTTLE at his head.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">An ingenious gentleman was mentioned, concerning whom both Robertson and Ramsay agreed that he had a constant firmness of mind; for after a laborious day, and amidst a multiplicity of cares and anxieties, he would sit down with his sisters and he quite cheerful and good-humoured. Such a disposition, it was observed, was a happy gift of nature. JOHNSON. &lsquo;I do not think so; a man has from nature a certain portion of mind; the use he makes of it depends upon his own free will. That a man has always the same firmness of mind I do not say; because every man feels his mind less firm at one time than another; but I think a man&rsquo;s being in a good or bad humour depends upon his will.&rsquo; I, however, could not help thinking that a man&rsquo;s humour is often uncontroulable by his will.</p>
<p class="p24">Next day, Thursday, April 30, I found him at home by himself. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Well, Sir, Ramsay gave us a splendid dinner. I love Ramsay. You will not find a man in whose conversation there is more instruction, more information, and more elegance, than in Ramsay&rsquo;s.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;What I admire in Ramsay, is his continuing to be so young.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, yes, Sir, it is to be admired. I value myself upon this, that there is nothing of the old man in my conversation. I am now sixty-eight, and I have no more of it than at twenty-eight.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;But, Sir, would not you wish to know old age? He who is never an old man, does not know the whole of human life; for old age is one of the divisions of it.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Nay, Sir, what talk is this?&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;I mean, Sir, the Sphinx&rsquo;s description of it; &mdash; morning, noon, and night. I would know night, as well as morning and noon.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;What, Sir, would you know what it is to feel the evils of old age? Would you have the gout? Would you have decrepitude?&rsquo; &mdash; Seeing him heated, I would not argue any farther; but I was confident that I was in the right. I would, in due time, be a Nestor, an elder of the people; and there SHOULD be some difference between the conversation of twenty-eight and sixty-eight. A grave picture should not be gay. There is a serene, solemn, placid old age. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Mrs. Thrale&rsquo;s mother said of me what flattered me much. A clergyman was complaining of want of society in the country where he lived; and said, &ldquo;They talk of RUNTS;&rdquo; (that is, young cows). &ldquo;Sir, (said Mrs. Salusbury,) Mr. Johnson would learn to talk of runts:&rdquo; meaning that I was a man who would make the most of my situation, whatever it was.&rsquo; He added, &lsquo;I think myself a very polite man.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Saturday, May 2, I dined with him at Sir Joshua Reynolds&rsquo;s, where there was a very large company, and a great deal of conversation; but owing to some circumstance which I cannot now recollect, I have no record of any part of it, except that there were several people there by no means of the Johnsonian school; so that less attention was paid to him than usual, which put him out of humour; and upon some imaginary offence from me, he attacked me with such rudeness, that I was vexed and angry, because it gave those persons an opportunity of enlarging upon his supposed ferocity, and ill treatment of his best friends. I was so much hurt, and had my pride so much roused, that I kept away from him for a week; and, perhaps, might have kept away much longer, nay, gone to Scotland without seeing him again, had not we fortunately met and been reconciled. To such unhappy chances are human friendships liable.</p>
<p class="p24">On Friday, May 8, I dined with him at Mr. Langton&rsquo;s. I was reserved and silent, which I suppose he perceived, and might recollect the cause. After dinner when Mr. Langton was called out of the room, and we were by ourselves, he drew his chair near to mine, and said, in a tone of conciliating courtesy, &lsquo;Well, how have you done?&rsquo; Boswell. &lsquo;Sir, you have made me very uneasy by your behaviour to me when we were last at Sir Joshua Reynolds&rsquo;s. You know, my dear Sir, no man has a greater respect and affection for you, or would sooner go to the end of the world to serve you. Now to treat me so &mdash; .&rsquo; He insisted that I had interrupted him, which I assured him was not the case; and proceeded&mdash; &lsquo;But why treat me so before people who neither love you nor me?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Well, I am sorry for it. I&rsquo;ll make it up to you twenty different ways, as you please.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;I said to-day to Sir Joshua, when he observed that you TOSSED me sometimes &mdash; I don&rsquo;t care how often, or how high he tosses me, when only friends are present, for then I fall upon soft ground: but I do not like falling on stones, which is the case when enemies are present. &mdash; I think this a pretty good image, Sir.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, it is one of the happiest I have ever heard.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">The truth is, there was no venom in the wounds which he inflicted at any time, unless they were irritated by some malignant infusion by other hands. We were instantly as cordial again as ever, and joined in hearty laugh at some ludicrous but innocent peculiarities of one of our friends. BOSWELL. &lsquo;Do you think, Sir, it is always culpable to laugh at a man to his face?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, that depends upon the man and the thing. If it is a slight man, and a slight thing, you may; for you take nothing valuable from him.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">When Mr. Langton returned to us, the &lsquo;flow of talk&rsquo; went on. An eminent authour being mentioned; &mdash; JOHNSON. &lsquo;He is not a pleasant man. His conversation is neither instructive nor brilliant. He does not talk as if impelled by any fulness of knowledge or vivacity of imagination. His conversation is like that of any other sensible man. He talks with no wish either to inform or to hear, but only because he thinks it does not become &mdash;&mdash;&nbsp; &mdash;&mdash;&nbsp; &mdash;&mdash; to sit in a company and say nothing.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Mr. Langton having repeated the anecdote of Addison having distinguished between his powers in conversation and in writing, by saying &lsquo;I have only nine-pence in my pocket; but I can draw for a thousand pounds;&rsquo; &mdash; JOHNSON. &lsquo;He had not that retort ready, Sir; he had prepared it before-hand.&rsquo; LANGTON. (turning to me,) &lsquo;A fine surmise. Set a thief to catch a thief.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">JOHNSON. &lsquo;I shall be at home to-morrow.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Then let us dine by ourselves at the Mitre, to keep up the old custom, &ldquo;the custom of the manor,&rdquo; the custom of the mitre.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, so it shall be.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Saturday, May 9, we fulfilled our purpose of dining by ourselves at the Mitre, according to old custom. There was, on these occasions, a little circumstance of kind attention to Mrs. Williams, which must not be omitted. Before coming out, and leaving her to dine alone, he gave her her choice of a chicken, a sweetbread, or any other little nice thing, which was carefully sent to her from the tavern, ready-drest.</p>
<p class="p24">On Tuesday, May 12, I waited on the Earl of Marchmont, to know if his Lordship would favour Dr. Johnson with information concerning Pope, whose Life he was about to write. Johnson had not flattered himself with the hopes of receiving any civility from this nobleman; for he said to me, when I mentioned Lord Marchmont as one who could tell him a great deal about Pope,&mdash; &lsquo;Sir, he will tell ME nothing.&rsquo; I had the honour of being known to his Lordship, and applied to him of myself, without being commissioned by Johnson. His Lordship behaved in the most polite and obliging manner, promised to tell all he recollected about Pope, and was so very courteous as to say, &lsquo;Tell Dr. Johnson I have a great respect for him, and am ready to shew it in any way I can. I am to be in the city to-morrow, and will call at his house as I return.&rsquo; His Lordship however asked, &lsquo;Will he write the Lives of the Poets impartially? He was the first that brought Whig and Tory into a Dictionary. And what do you think of his definition of Excise? Do you know the history of his aversion to the word transpire?&rsquo; Then taking down the folio Dictionary, he shewed it with this censure on its secondary sense: &lsquo;&ldquo;To escape from secrecy to notice; a sense lately innovated from France, without necessity.&rdquo; The truth was Lord Bolingbroke, who left the Jacobites, first used it; therefore, it was to be condemned. He should have shewn what word would do for it, if it was unnecessary.&rsquo; I afterwards put the question to Johnson: &lsquo;Why, Sir, (said he,) GET ABROAD.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;That, Sir, is using two words.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, there is no end of this. You may as well insist to have a word for old age.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Well, Sir, Senectus.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Nay, Sir, to insist always that there should be one word to express a thing in English, because there is one in another language, is to change the language.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I proposed to Lord Marchmont that he should revise Johnson&rsquo;s Life of Pope: &lsquo;So (said his Lordship,) you would put me in a dangerous situation. You know he knocked down Osborne the bookseller.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Elated with the success of my spontaneous exertion to procure material and respectable aid to Johnson for his very favourite work, The Lives of the Poets, I hastened down to Mr. Thrale&rsquo;s at Streatham, where he now was, that I might insure his being at home next day; and after dinner, when I thought he would receive the good news in the best humour, I announced it eagerly: &lsquo;I have been at work for you to-day, Sir. I have been with Lord Marchmont. He bade me tell you he has a great respect for you, and will call on you to-morrow at one o&rsquo;clock, and communicate all he knows about Pope.&rsquo; &mdash; Here I paused, in full expectation that he would be pleased with this intelligence, would praise my active merit, and would be alert to embrace such an offer from a nobleman. But whether I had shewn an over-exultation, which provoked his spleen; or whether he was seized with a suspicion that I had obtruded him on Lord Marchmont, and humbled him too much; or whether there was any thing more than an unlucky fit of ill-humour, I know not; but, to my surprize, the result was, &mdash; JOHNSON. &lsquo;I shall not be in town to-morrow. I don&rsquo;t care to know about Pope.&rsquo; MRS. THRALE. (surprized as I was, and a little angry,) &lsquo;I suppose, Sir, Mr. Boswell thought, that as you are to write Pope&rsquo;s Life, you would wish to know about him.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Wish! why yes. If it rained knowledge I&rsquo;d hold out my hand; but I would not give myself the trouble to go in quest of it.&rsquo; There was no arguing with him at the moment. Some time afterwards he said, &lsquo;Lord Marchmont will call on me, and then I shall call on Lord Marchmont.&rsquo; Mr. Thrale was uneasy at his unaccountable caprice; and told me, that if I did not take care to bring about a meeting between Lord Marchmont and him, it would never take place, which would be a great pity. I sent a card to his Lordship, to be left at Johnson&rsquo;s house, acquainting him, that Dr. Johnson could not be in town next day, but would do himself the honour of waiting on him at another time. I give this account fairly, as a specimen of that unhappy temper with which this great and good man had occasionally to struggle, from something morbid in his constitution. Let the most censorious of my readers suppose himself to have a violent fit of the tooth-ach, or to have received a severe stroke on the shin-bone, and when in such a state to be asked a question; and if he has any candour, he will not be surprized at the answers which Johnson sometimes gave in moments of irritation, which, let me assure them, is exquisitely painful. But it must not be erroneously supposed that he was, in the smallest degree, careless concerning any work which he undertook, or that he was generally thus peevish. It will be seen, that in the following year he had a very agreeable interview with Lord Marchmont, at his Lordship&rsquo;s house; and this very afternoon he soon forgot any fretfulness, and fell into conversation as usual.</p>
<p class="p24">JOHNSON. &lsquo;How foolish was it in Pope to give all his friendship to Lords, who thought they honoured him by being with him; and to choose such Lords as Burlington, and Cobham, and Bolingbroke! Bathurst was negative, a pleasing man; and I have heard no ill of Marchmont; and then always saying, &ldquo;I do not value you for being a Lord;&rdquo; which was a sure proof that he did. I never say, I do not value Boswell more for being born to an estate, because I do not care.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Nor for being a Scotchman?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Nay, Sir, I do value you more for being a Scotchman. You are a Scotchman without the faults of a Scotchman. You would not have been so valuable as you are, had you not been a Scotchman.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Amongst the numerous prints pasted on the walls of the dining-room at Streatham, was Hogarth&rsquo;s &lsquo;Modern Midnight Conversation.&rsquo; I asked him what he knew of Parson Ford, who makes a conspicuous figure in the riotous group. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, he was my acquaintance and relation, my mother&rsquo;s nephew. He had purchased a living in the country, but not simoniacally. I never saw him but in the country. I have been told he was a man of great parts; very profligate, but I never heard he was impious.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Was there not a story of his ghost having appeared?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, it was believed. A waiter at the Hummums, in which house Ford died, had been absent for some time, and returned, not knowing that Ford was dead. Going down to the cellar, according to the story, he met him; going down again he met him a second time. When he came up, he asked some of the people of the house what Ford could be doing there. They told him Ford was dead. The waiter took a fever, in which he lay for some time. When he recovered, he said he had a message to deliver to some women from Ford; but he was not to tell what, or to whom. He walked out; he was followed; but somewhere about St. Paul&rsquo;s they lost him. He came back, and said he had delivered the message, and the women exclaimed, &ldquo;Then we are all undone!&rdquo; Dr. Pellet, who was not a credulous man, inquired into the truth of this story, and he said, the evidence was irresistible. My wife went to the Hummums; (it is a place where people get themselves cupped.) I believe she went with intention to hear about this story of Ford. At first they were unwilling to tell her; but, after they had talked to her, she came away satisfied that it was true. To be sure the man had a fever; and this vision may have been the beginning of it. But if the message to the women, and their behaviour upon it, were true as related, there was something supernatural. That rests upon his word; and there it remains.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I staid all this day* with him at Streatham. He talked a great deal, in very good humour.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Wednesday, May 13. &mdash; ED.</p>
<p class="p24">Looking at Messrs. Dilly&rsquo;s splendid edition of Lord Chesterfield&rsquo;s miscellaneous works, he laughed, and said, &lsquo;Here now are two speeches ascribed to him, both of which were written by me: and the best of it is, they have found out that one is like Demosthenes, and the other like Cicero.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">BOSWELL. &lsquo;Is not modesty natural?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;I cannot say, Sir, as we find no people quite in a state of nature; but I think the more they are taught, the more modest they are. The French are a gross, ill-bred, untaught people; a lady there will spit on the floor and rub it with her foot. What I gained by being in France was, learning to be better satisfied with my own country. Time may be employed to more advantage from nineteen to twenty-four almost in any way than in travelling; when you set travelling against mere negation, against doing nothing, it is better to be sure; but how much more would a young man improve were he to study during those years. Indeed, if a young man is wild, and must run after women and bad company, it is better this should be done abroad, as, on his return, he can break off such connections, and begin at home a new man, with a character to form, and acquaintances to make. How little does travelling supply to the conversation of any man who has travelled; how little to Beauclerk!&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;What say you to Lord &mdash;&mdash;&nbsp; &mdash; ?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;I never but once heard him talk of what he had seen, and that was of a large serpent in one of the Pyramids of Egypt.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Well, I happened to hear him tell the same thing, which made me mention him.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I talked of a country life. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Were I to live in the country, I would not devote myself to the acquisition of popularity; I would live in a much better way, much more happily; I would have my time at my own command.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;But, Sir, is it not a sad thing to be at a distance from all our literary friends?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, you will by and by have enough of this conversation, which now delights you so much.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">As he was a zealous friend of subordination, he was at all times watchful to repress the vulgar cant against the manners of the great; &lsquo;High people, Sir, (said he,) are the best; take a hundred ladies of quality, you&rsquo;ll find them better wives, better mothers, more willing to sacrifice their own pleasure to their children than a hundred other women. Tradeswomen (I mean the wives of tradesmen) in the city, who are worth from ten to fifteen thousand pounds, are the worst creatures upon the earth, grossly ignorant, and thinking viciousness fashionable. Farmers, I think, are often worthless fellows. Few lords will cheat; and, if they do, they&rsquo;ll be ashamed of it: farmers cheat and are not ashamed of it: they have all the sensual vices too of the nobility, with cheating into the bargain. There is as much fornication and adultery among farmers as amongst noblemen.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;The notion of the world, Sir, however is, that the morals of women of quality are worse than those in lower stations.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Yes, Sir, the licentiousness of one woman of quality makes more noise than that of a number of women in lower stations; then, Sir, you are to consider the malignity of women in the city against women of quality, which will make them believe any thing of them, such as that they call their coachmen to bed. No, Sir, so far as I have observed, the higher in rank, the richer ladies are, they are the better instructed and the more virtuous.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Tuesday, May 19, I was to set out for Scotland in the evening. He was engaged to dine with me at Mr. Dilly&rsquo;s, I waited upon him to remind him of his appointment and attend him thither; he gave me some salutary counsel, and recommended vigorous resolution against any deviation from moral duty. BOSWELL. &lsquo;But you would not have me to bind myself by a solemn obligation?&rsquo; JOHNSON. (much agitated,) &lsquo;What! a vow &mdash; O, no, Sir, a vow is a horrible thing, it is a snare for sin. The man who cannot go to Heaven without a vow &mdash; may go&mdash; &lsquo; Here, standing erect, in the middle of his library, and rolling grand, his pause was truly a curious compound of the solemn and the ludicrous; he half-whistled in his usual way, when pleasant, and he paused, as if checked by religious awe. Methought he would have added &mdash; to Hell &mdash; but was restrained. I humoured the dilemma. &lsquo;What! Sir, (said I,) In caelum jusseris ibit?&rsquo; alluding to his imitation of it, &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;And bid him go to Hell, to Hell he goes.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">We had a quiet comfortable meeting at Mr. Dilly&rsquo;s; nobody there but ourselves. My illustrious friend and I parted with assurances of affectionate regard.</p>
<p class="p24">Mr. Langton has been pleased, at my request, to favour me with some particulars of Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s visit to Warley-camp, where this gentleman was at the time stationed as a Captain in the Lincolnshire militia. I shall give them in his own words in a letter to me.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;It was in the summer of the year 1778, that he complied with my invitation to come down to the Camp at Warley, and he staid with me about a week; the scene appeared, notwithstanding a great degree of ill health that he seemed to labour under, to interest and amuse him, as agreeing with the disposition that I believe you know he constantly manifested towards enquiring into subjects of the military kind. He sate, with a patient degree of attention, to observe the proceedings of a regimental court-martial, that happened to be called, in the time of his stay with us; and one night, as late as at eleven o&rsquo;clock, he accompanied the Major of the regiment in going what are styled the Rounds, where he might observe the forms of visiting the guards, for the seeing that they and their sentries are ready in their duty on their several posts. He took occasion to converse at times on military topicks, one in particular, that I see the mention of, in your Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides, which lies open before me, as to gun-powder; which he spoke of to the same effect, in part, that you relate.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;On one occasion, when the regiment were going through their exercise, he went quite close to the men at one of the extremities of it, and watched all their practices attentively; and, when he came away, his remark was, &ldquo;The men indeed do load their muskets and fire with wonderful celerity.&rdquo; He was likewise particular in requiring to know what was the weight of the musquet balls in use, and within what distance they might be expected to take effect when fired off.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;In walking among the tents, and observing the difference between those of the officers and private men, he said that the superiority of accommodation of the better conditions of life, to that of the inferiour ones, was never exhibited to him in so distinct a view. The civilities paid to him in the camp were, from the gentlemen of the Lincolnshire regiment, one of the officers of which accommodated him with a tent in which he slept; and from General Hall, who very courteously invited him to dine with him, where he appeared to be very well pleased with his entertainment, and the civilities he received on the part of the General; the attention likewise, of the General&rsquo;s aide-de-camp, Captain Smith, seemed to be very welcome to him, as appeared by their engaging in a great deal of discourse together.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">We surely cannot but admire the benevolent exertions of this great and good man, especially when we consider how grievously he was afflicted with bad health, and how uncomfortable his home was made by the perpetual jarring of those whom he charitably accommodated under his roof. He has sometimes suffered me to talk jocularly of his group of females, and call them his Seraglio. He thus mentions them, together with honest Levett, in one of his letters to Mrs. Thrale: &lsquo;Williams hates every body; Levett hates Desmoulins, and does not love Williams; Desmoulins hates them both; Poll* loves none of them.&rsquo;**</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Miss Carmichael.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;** A year later he wrote: At Bolt-court there is much</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;malignity, but of late little hostility.&rsquo; &mdash; ED.</p>
<p class="p24">In 1779, Johnson gave the world a luminous proof that the vigour of his mind in all its faculties, whether memory, judgement, or imagination, was not in the least abated; for this year came out the first four volumes of his Prefaces, biographical and critical, to the most eminent of the English Poets, published by the booksellers of London. The remaining volumes came out in the year 1780. The Poets were selected by the several booksellers who had the honorary copy right, which is still preserved among them by mutual compact, notwithstanding the decision of the House of Lords against the perpetuity of Literary Property. We have his own authority, that by his recommendation the poems of Blackmore, Watts, Pomfret, and Yalden, were added to the collection.</p>
<p class="p24">On the 22nd of January, I wrote to him on several topicks, and mentioned that as he had been so good as to permit me to have the proof sheets of his Lives of the Poets, I had written to his servant, Francis, to take care of them for me.</p>
<p class="p24">On the 23rd of February I wrote to him again, complaining of his silence, as I had heard he was ill, and had written to Mr. Thrale, for information concerning him; and I announced my intention of soon being again in London.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;TO JAMES BOSWELL, ESQ.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;DEAR SIR, &mdash; Why should you take such delight to make a bustle, to write to Mr. Thrale that I am negligent, and to Francis to do what is so very unnecessary. Thrale, you may be sure, cared not about it; and I shall spare Francis the trouble, by ordering a set both of the Lives and Poets to dear Mrs. Boswell,* in acknowledgement of her marmalade. Persuade her to accept them, and accept them kindly. If I thought she would receive them scornfully, I would send them to Miss Boswell, who, I hope, has yet none of her mamma&rsquo;s ill-will to me. . . .</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Mrs. Thrale waits in the coach. I am, dear Sir, &amp;c.,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;March 13, 1779.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* He sent a set elegantly bound and gilt, which was received</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as a very handsome present. &mdash; BOSWELL</p>
<p class="p24">This letter crossed me on the road to London, where I arrived on Monday, March 15, and next morning at a late hour, found Dr. Johnson sitting over his tea, attended by Mrs. Desmoulins, Mr. Levett, and a clergyman, who had come to submit some poetical pieces to his revision. It is wonderful what a number and variety of writers, some of them even unknown to him, prevailed on his good-nature to look over their works, and suggest corrections and improvements. My arrival interrupted for a little while the important business of this true representative of Bayes; upon its being resumed, I found that the subject under immediate consideration was a translation, yet in manuscript, of the Carmen Seculare of Horace, which had this year been set to musick, and performed as a publick entertainment in London, for the joint benefit of monsieur Philidor and Signor Baretti. When Johnson had done reading, the authour asked him bluntly, &lsquo;If upon the whole it was a good translation?&rsquo; Johnson, whose regard for truth was uncommonly strict, seemed to be puzzled for a moment, what answer to make; as he certainly could not honestly commend the performance: with exquisite address he evaded the question thus, &lsquo;Sir, I do not say that it may not be made a very good translation.&rsquo; Here nothing whatever in favour of the performance was affirmed, and yet the writer was not shocked. A printed Ode to the Warlike Genius of Britain, came next in review; the bard was a lank bony figure, with short black hair; he was writhing himself in agitation, while Johnson read, and shewing his teeth in a grin of earnestness, exclaimed in broken sentences, and in a keen sharp tone, &lsquo;Is that poetry, Sir? &mdash; Is it Pindar?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, there is here a great deal of what is called poetry.&rsquo; Then, turning to me, the poet cried, &lsquo;My muse has not been long upon the town, and (pointing to the Ode) it trembles under the hand of the great critick.&rsquo; Johnson, in a tone of displeasure, asked him, &lsquo;Why do you praise Anson?&rsquo; I did not trouble him by asking his reason for this question. He proceeded, &lsquo;Here is an errour, Sir; you have made Genius feminine.&rsquo; &lsquo;Palpable, Sir; (cried the enthusiast,) I know it. But (in a lower tone,) it was to pay a compliment to the Duchess of Devonshire, with which her Grace was pleased. She is walking across Coxheath, in the military uniform, and I suppose her to be the Genius of Britain.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, you are giving a reason for it; but that will not make it right. You may have a reason why two and two should make five; but they will still make but four.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Although I was several times with him in the course of the following days, such it seems were my occupations, or such my negligence, that I have preserved no memorial of his conversation till Friday, March 26, when I visited him. He said he expected to be attacked on account of his Lives of the Poets. &lsquo;However (said he,) I would rather be attacked than unnoticed. For the worst thing you can do to an authour is to be silent as to his works. An assault upon a town is a bad thing; but starving it is still worse; an assault may be unsuccessful; you may have more men killed than you kill; but if you starve the town, you are sure of victory.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Talking of a friend of ours associating with persons of very discordant principles and characters; I said he was a very universal man, quite a man of the world. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Yes, Sir; but one may be so much a man of the world as to be nothing in the world. I remember a passage in Goldsmith&rsquo;s Vicar of Wakefield, which he was afterwards fool enough to expunge: &ldquo;I do not love a man who is zealous for nothing.&rdquo;&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;That was a fine passage.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Yes, Sir: there was another fine passage too, which be struck out: &ldquo;When I was a young man, being anxious to distinguish myself, I was perpetually starting new propositions. But I soon gave this over; for, I found that generally what was new was false.&rdquo;&rsquo; I said I did not like to sit with people of whom I had not a good opinion. JOHNSON. &lsquo;But you must not indulge your delicacy too much; or you will be a tete-a-tete man all your life.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">During my stay in London this spring, I find I was unaccountably negligent in preserving Johnson&rsquo;s sayings, more so than at any time when I was happy enough to have an opportunity of hearing his wisdom and wit. There is no help for it now. I must content myself with presenting such scraps as I have. But I am nevertheless ashamed and vexed to think how much has been lost. It is not that there was a bad crop this year; but that I was not sufficiently careful in gathering it in. I, therefore, in some instances can only exhibit a few detached fragments.</p>
<p class="p24">Talking of the wonderful concealment of the authour of the celebrated letters signed Junius; he said, &lsquo;I should have believed Burke to be Junius, because I know no man but Burke who is capable of writing these letters; but Burke spontaneously denied it to me. The case would have been different had I asked him if he was the authour; a man so questioned, as to an anonymous publication, may think he has a right to deny it.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Wednesday, March 31, when I visited him, and confessed an excess of which I had very seldom been guilty; that I had spent a whole night in playing at cards, and that I could not look back on it with satisfaction; instead of a harsh animadversion, he mildly said, &lsquo;Alas, Sir, on how few things can we look back with satisfaction.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Friday, April 2, being Good-Friday, I visited him in the morning as usual; and finding that we insensibly fell into a train of ridicule upon the foibles of one of our friends, a very worthy man, I, by way of a check, quoted some good admonition from The Government of the Tongue, that very pious book. It happened also remarkably enough, that the subject of the sermon preached to us to-day by Dr. Burrows, the rector of St. Clement Danes, was the certainty that at the last day we must give an account of &lsquo;the deeds done in the body;&rsquo; and, amongst various acts of culpability he mentioned evil-speaking. As we were moving slowly along in the crowd from church, Johnson jogged my elbow, and said, &lsquo;Did you attend to the sermon?&rsquo; &lsquo;Yes, Sir, (said I,) it was very applicable to US.&rsquo; He, however, stood upon the defensive. &lsquo;Why, Sir, the sense of ridicule is given us, and may be lawfully used. The authour of The Government of the Tongue would have us treat all men alike.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">In the interval between morning and evening service, he endeavoured to employ himself earnestly in devotional exercises; and as he has mentioned in his Prayers and Meditations, gave me Les Pensees de Paschal, that I might not interrupt him. I preserve the book with reverence. His presenting it to me is marked upon it with his own hand, and I have found in it a truly divine unction. We went to church again in the afternoon.</p>
<p class="p24">On Wednesday, April 7, I dined with him at Sir Joshua Reynolds&rsquo;s. I have not marked what company was there. Johnson harangued upon the qualities of different liquors; and spoke with great contempt of claret, as so weak, that a man would be drowned by it before it made him drunk.&rsquo; He was persuaded to drink one glass of it, that he might judge, not from recollection, which might be dim, but from immediate sensation. He shook his head, and said, &lsquo;Poor stuff! No, Sir, claret is the liquor for boys; port for men; but he who aspires to be a hero (smiling), must drink brandy. In the first place, the flavour of brandy is most grateful to the palate; and then brandy will do soonest for a man what drinking CAN do for him. There are, indeed, few who are able to drink brandy. That is a power rather to be wished for than attained. And yet, (proceeded he,) as in all pleasure hope is a considerable part, I know not but fruition comes too quick by brandy. Florence wine I think the worst; it is wine only to the eye; it is wine neither while you are drinking it, nor after you have drunk it; it neither pleases the taste, nor exhilarates the spirits.&rsquo; I reminded him how heartily he and I used to drink wine together, when we were first acquainted; and how I used to have a head-ache after sitting up with him. He did not like to have this recalled, or, perhaps, thinking that I boasted improperly, resolved to have a witty stroke at me: &lsquo;Nay, Sir, it was not the WINE that made your head ache, but the SENSE that I put into it.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;What, Sir! will sense make the head ache?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Yes, Sir, (with a smile,) when it is not used to it.&rsquo; &mdash; No man who has a true relish of pleasantry could be offended at this; especially if Johnson in a long intimacy had given him repeated proofs of his regard and good estimation. I used to say, that as he had given me a thousand pounds in praise, he had a good right now and then to take a guinea from me.</p>
<p class="p24">On Thursday, April 8, I dined with him at Mr. Allan Ramsay&rsquo;s, with Lord Graham and some other company. We talked of Shakspeare&rsquo;s witches. JOHNSON. &lsquo;They are beings of his own creation; they are a compound of malignity and meanness, without any abilities; and are quite different from the Italian magician. King James says in his Daemonology, &lsquo;Magicians command the devils: witches are their servants. The Italian magicians are elegant beings.&rsquo; RAMSAY. &lsquo;Opera witches, not Drury-lane witches.&rsquo; Johnson observed, that abilities might be employed in a narrow sphere, as in getting money, which he said he believed no man could do, without vigorous parts, though concentrated to a point. RAMSAY. &lsquo;Yes, like a strong horse in a mill; he pulls better.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Lord Graham, while he praised the beauty of Lochlomond, on the banks of which is his family seat, complained of the climate, and said he could not bear it. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Nay, my Lord, don&rsquo;t talk so: you may bear it well enough. Your ancestors have borne it more years than I can tell.&rsquo; This was a handsome compliment to the antiquity of the House of Montrose. His Lordship told me afterwards, that he had only affected to complain of the climate; lest, if he had spoken as favourably of his country as he really thought, Dr. Johnson might have attacked it. Johnson was very courteous to Lady Margaret Macdonald. &lsquo;Madam, (said he,) when I was in the Isle of Sky, I heard of the people running to take the stones off the road, lest Lady Margaret&rsquo;s horse should stumble.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Lord Graham commended Dr. Drummond at Naples, as a man of extraordinary talents; and added, that he had a great love of liberty. JOHNSON. &lsquo;He is YOUNG, my Lord; (looking to his Lordship with an arch smile,) all BOYS love liberty, till experience convinces them they are not so fit to govern themselves as they imagined. We are all agreed as to our own liberty; we would have as much of it as we can get; but we are not agreed as to the liberty of others: for in proportion as we take, others must lose. I believe we hardly wish that the mob should have liberty to govern us. When that was the case some time ago, no man was at liberty not to have candles in his windows.&rsquo; RAMSAY. &lsquo;The result is, that order is better than confusion.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;The result is, that order cannot be had but by subordination.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Friday, April 16, I had been present at the trial of the unfortunate Mr. Hackman, who, in a fit of frantick jealous love, had shot Miss Ray, the favourite of a nobleman. Johnson, in whose company I dined to-day with some other friends, was much interested by my account of what passed, and particularly with his prayer for the mercy of heaven. He said, in a solemn fervid tone, &lsquo;I hope he SHALL find mercy.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">This day a violent altercation arose between Johnson and Beauclerk, which having made much noise at the time, I think it proper, in order to prevent any future misrepresentation, to give a minute account of it.</p>
<p class="p24">In talking of Hackman, Johnson argued, as Judge Blackstone had done, that his being furnished with two pistols was a proof that he meant to shoot two persons. Mr. Beauclerk said, &lsquo;No; for that every wise man who intended to shoot himself, took two pistols, that he might be sure of doing it at once. Lord &mdash;&mdash;&nbsp; &mdash;&mdash;&nbsp; &mdash; &mdash; &lsquo; cook shot himself with one pistol, and lived ten days in great agony. Mr. &mdash;&mdash;&nbsp; &mdash; , who loved buttered muffins, but durst not eat them because they disagreed with his stomach, resolved to shoot himself; and then he eat three buttered muffins for breakfast, before shooting himself, knowing that he should not be troubled with indigestion: HE had two charged pistols; one was found lying charged upon the table by him, after he had shot himself with the other.&rsquo; &lsquo;Well, (said Johnson, with an air of triumph,) you see here one pistol was sufficient.&rsquo; Beauclerk replied smartly, &lsquo;Because it happened to kill him.&rsquo; And either then or a very little afterwards, being piqued at Johnson&rsquo;s triumphant remark, added, &lsquo;This is what you don&rsquo;t know, and I do.&rsquo; There was then a cessation of the dispute; and some minutes intervened, during which, dinner and the glass went on cheerfully; when Johnson suddenly and abruptly exclaimed, &lsquo;Mr. Beauclerk, how came you to talk so petulantly to me, as &ldquo;This is what you don&rsquo;t know, but what I know&rdquo;? One thing I know, which YOU don&rsquo;t seem to know, that you are very uncivil.&rsquo; BEAUCLERK. &lsquo;Because YOU began by being uncivil, (which you always are.)&rsquo; The words in parenthesis were, I believe, not heard by Dr. Johnson. Here again there was a cessation of arms. Johnson told me, that the reason why he waited at first some time without taking any notice of what Mr. Beauclerk said, was because he was thinking whether he should resent it. But when he considered that there were present a young Lord and an eminent traveller, two men of the world with whom he had never dined before, he was apprehensive that they might think they had a right to take such liberties with him as Beauclerk did, and therefore resolved he would not let it pass; adding, that &lsquo;he would not appear a coward.&rsquo; A little while after this, the conversation turned on the violence of Hackman&rsquo;s temper. Johnson then said, &lsquo;It was his business to COMMAND his temper, as my friend, Mr. Beauclerk, should have done some time ago.&rsquo; BEAUCLERK. &lsquo;I should learn of YOU, Sir.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, you have given ME opportunities enough of learning, when I have been in YOUR company. No man loves to be treated with contempt.&rsquo; BEAUCLERK. (with a polite inclination towards Johnson,) &lsquo;Sir, you have known me twenty years, and however I may have treated others, you may be sure I could never treat you with contempt.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, you have said more than was necessary.&rsquo; Thus it ended; and Beauclerk&rsquo;s coach not having come for him till very late, Dr. Johnson and another gentleman sat with him a long time after the rest of the company were gone; and he and I dined at Beauclerk&rsquo;s on the Saturday se&rsquo;nnight following.</p>
<p class="p24">After this tempest had subsided, I recollect the following particulars of his conversation: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am always for getting a boy forward in his learning; for that is a sure good. I would let him at first read ANY English book which happens to engage his attention; because you have done a great deal when you have brought him to have entertainment from a book. He&rsquo;ll get better books afterwards.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To be contradicted, in order to force you to talk, is mighty unpleasing. You SHINE, indeed; but it is by being GROUND.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Saturday, April 24, I dined with him at Mr. Beauclerk&rsquo;s, with Sir Joshua Reynolds, Mr. Jones, (afterwards Sir William,) Mr. Langton, Mr. Steevens, Mr. Paradise, and Dr. Higgins. I mentioned that Mr. Wilkes had attacked Garrick to me, as a man who had no friend. &lsquo;I believe he is right, Sir. [Greek text omitted] &mdash; He had friends, but no friend. Garrick was so diffused, he had no man to whom he wished to unbosom himself. He found people always ready to applaud him, and that always for the same thing: so he saw life with great uniformity.&rsquo; I took upon me, for once, to fight with Goliath&rsquo;s weapons, and play the sophist. &mdash; Garrick did not need a friend, as he got from every body all he wanted. What is a friend? One who supports you and comforts you, while others do not. Friendship, you know, Sir, is the cordial drop, &ldquo;to make the nauseous draught of life go down:&rdquo; but if the draught be not nauseous, if it be all sweet, there is no occasion for that drop.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Many men would not be content to live so. I hope I should not. They would wish to have an intimate friend, with whom they might compare minds, and cherish private virtues. One of the company mentioned Lord Chesterfield, as a man who had no friend. JOHNSON. &lsquo;There were more materials to make friendship in Garrick, had he not been so diffused.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Garrick was pure gold, but beat out to thin leaf. Lord Chesterfield was tinsel.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Garrick was a very good man, the cheerfullest man of his age; a decent liver in a profession which is supposed to give indulgence to licentiousness; and a man who gave away, freely, money acquired by himself. He began the world with a great hunger for money; the son of a half-pay officer, bred in a family, whose study was to make four-pence do as much as others made four-pence halfpenny do. But, when he had got money, he was very liberal.&rsquo; I presumed to animadvert on his eulogy on Garrick, in his Lives of the Poets. &lsquo;You say, Sir, his death eclipsed the gaiety of nations.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;I could not have said more nor less. It is the truth; ECLIPSED, not EXTINGUISHED; and his death DID eclipse; it was like a storm.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;But why nations? Did his gaiety extend farther than his own nation?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, some exaggeration must be allowed. Besides, nations may be said &mdash; if we allow the Scotch to be a nation, and to have gaiety, &mdash; which they have not. YOU are an exception, though. Come, gentlemen, let us candidly admit that there is one Scotchman who is cheerful.&rsquo; BEAUCLERK. &lsquo;But he is a very unnatural Scotchman.&rsquo; I, however, continued to think the compliment to Garrick hyperbolically untrue. His acting had ceased some time before his death; at any rate he had acted in Ireland but a short time, at an early period of his life, and never in Scotland. I objected also to what appears an anticlimax of praise, when contrasted with the preceding panegyrick,&mdash; &lsquo;and diminished the public stock of harmless pleasure!&rsquo;&mdash; &lsquo;Is not HARMLESS PLEASURE very tame?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Nay, Sir, harmless pleasure is the highest praise. Pleasure is a word of dubious import; pleasure is in general dangerous, and pernicious to virtue; to be able therefore to furnish pleasure that is harmless, pleasure pure and unalloyed, is as great a power as man can possess.&rsquo; This was, perhaps, as ingenious a defence as could be made; still, however, I was not satisfied.</p>
<p class="p24">Talking of celebrated and successful irregular practisers in physick; he said, &lsquo;Taylor was the most ignorant man I ever knew; but sprightly. Ward the dullest. Taylor challenged me once to talk Latin with him; (laughing). I quoted some of Horace, which he took to be a part of my own speech. He said a few words well enough.&rsquo; BEAUCLERK. &lsquo;I remember, Sir, you said that Taylor was an instance how far impudence could carry ignorance.&rsquo; Mr. Beauclerk was very entertaining this day, and told us a number of short stories in a lively elegant manner, and with that air of THE WORLD which has I know not what impressive effect, as if there were something more than is expressed, or than perhaps we could perfectly understand. As Johnson and I accompanied Sir Joshua Reynolds in his coach, Johnson said, &lsquo;There is in Beauclerk a predominance over his company, that one does not like. But he is a man who has lived so much in the world, that he has a short story on every occasion; he is always ready to talk, and is never exhausted.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Soon after this time a little incident occurred, which I will not suppress, because I am desirous that my work should be, as much as is consistent with the strictest truth, an antidote to the false and injurious notions of his character, which have been given by others, and therefore I infuse every drop of genuine sweetness into my biographical cup.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;TO DR. JOHNSON.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;MY DEAR SIR, &mdash; I am in great pain with an inflamed foot, and obliged to keep my bed, so am prevented from having the pleasure to dine at Mr. Ramsay&rsquo;s to-day, which is very hard; and my spirits are sadly sunk. Will you be so friendly as to come and sit an hour with me in the evening. I am ever your most faithful, and affectionate humble servant,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;South Audley-street, Monday, April 26.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;JAMES BOSWELL.&rsquo; &lsquo;TO MR. BOSWELL.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Mr. Johnson laments the absence of Mr. Boswell, and will come to him. &mdash; Harley-street.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He came to me in the evening, and brought Sir Joshua Reynolds. I need scarcely say, that their conversation, while they sate by my bedside, was the most pleasing opiate to pain that could have been administered.</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson being now better disposed to obtain information concerning Pope than he was last year, sent by me to my Lord Marchmont a present of those volumes of his Lives of the Poets which were at this time published, with a request to have permission to wait on him; and his Lordship, who had called on him twice, obligingly appointed Saturday, the first of May, for receiving us.</p>
<p class="p24">On that morning Johnson came to me from Streatham, and after drinking chocolate at General Paoli&rsquo;s, in South-Audley-street, we proceeded to Lord Marchmont&rsquo;s in Curzon-street. His Lordship met us at the door of his library, and with great politeness said to Johnson, &lsquo;I am not going to make an encomium upon MYSELF, by telling you the high respect I have for YOU, Sir.&rsquo; Johnson was exceedingly courteous; and the interview, which lasted about two hours, during which the Earl communicated his anecdotes of Pope, was as agreeable as I could have wished. When we came out, I said to Johnson, that considering his Lordship&rsquo;s civility, I should have been vexed if he had again failed to come. &lsquo;Sir, (said he,) I would rather have given twenty pounds than not have come.&rsquo; I accompanied him to Streatham, where we dined, and returned to town in the evening.</p>
<p class="p24">He had, before I left London, resumed the conversation concerning the appearance of a ghost at Newcastle upon Tyne, which Mr. John Wesley believed, but to which Johnson did not give credit. I was, however, desirous to examine the question closely, and at the same time wished to be made acquainted with Mr. John Wesley; for though I differed from him in some points, I admired his various talents, and loved his pious zeal. At my request, therefore, Dr. Johnson gave me a letter of introduction to him.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;TO THE REVEREND MR. JOHN WESLEY.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;SIR, &mdash; Mr. Boswell, a gentleman who has been long known to me, is desirous of being known to you, and has asked this recommendation, which I give him with great willingness, because I think it very much to be wished that worthy and religious men should be acquainted with each other. I am, Sir, your most humble servant,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;May 3, 1779.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Mr. Wesley being in the course of his ministry at Edinburgh, I presented this letter to him, and was very politely received. I begged to have it returned to me, which was accordingly done. His state of the evidence as to the ghost did not satisfy me.</p>
<p class="p24">My readers will not be displeased at being told every slight circumstance of the manner in which Dr. Johnson contrived to amuse his solitary hours. He sometimes employed himself in chymistry, sometimes in watering and pruning a vine, sometimes in small experiments, at which those who may smile, should recollect that there are moments which admit of being soothed only by trifles.*</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* In one of his manuscript Diaries, there is the following</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;entry, which marks his curious minute attention: &lsquo;July 26,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1768.&nbsp; I shaved my nail by accident in whetting the knife,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;about an eighth of an inch from the bottom, and about a</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fourth from the top.&nbsp; This I measure that I may know the</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;growth of nails; the whole is about five eighths of an</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;inch.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another of the same kind appears, &lsquo;Aug. 7, 1779, Partem</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;brachii dextri carpo proximum et cutem pectoris circa</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mamillam dextram rasi, ut notum fieret quanto temporis pili</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;renovarentur.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, &lsquo;Aug. 15, 1773.&nbsp; I cut from the vine 41 leaves, which</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;weighed five oz. and a half, and eight scruples: &mdash; I lay them</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;upon my bookcase, to see what weight they will lose by</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;drying.&rsquo; &mdash; BOSWELL.</p>
<p class="p24">My friend Colonel James Stuart, second son of the Earl of Bute, who had distinguished himself as a good officer of the Bedfordshire militia, had taken a publick-spirited resolution to serve his country in its difficulties, by raising a regular regiment, and taking the command of it himself. This, in the heir of the immense property of Wortley, was highly honourable. Having been in Scotland recruiting, he obligingly asked me to accompany him to Leeds, then the head-quarters of his corps; from thence to London for a short time, and afterwards to other places to which the regiment might be ordered. Such an offer, at a time of the year when I had full leisure, was very pleasing; especially as I was to accompany a man of sterling good sense, information, discernment, and conviviality; and was to have a second crop in one year of London and Johnson. Of this I informed my illustrious friend, in characteristical warm terms, in a letter dated the 30th of September, from Leeds.</p>
<p class="p24">On Monday, October 4, I called at his house before he was up. He sent for me to his bedside, and expressed his satisfaction at this incidental meeting, with as much vivacity as if he had been in the gaiety of youth. He called briskly, &lsquo;Frank, go and get coffee, and let us breakfast IN SPLENDOUR.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Sunday, October 10, we dined together at Mr. Strahan&rsquo;s. The conversation having turned on the prevailing practice of going to the East-Indies in quest of wealth; &mdash; JOHNSON. &lsquo;A man had better have ten thousand pounds at the end of ten years passed in England, than twenty thousand pounds at the end of ten years passed in India, because you must compute what you GIVE for money; and a man who has lived ten years in India, has given up ten years of social comfort and all those advantages which arise from living in England. The ingenious Mr. Brown, distinguished by the name of Capability Brown, told me, that he was once at the seat of Lord Clive, who had returned from India with great wealth; and that he shewed him at the door of his bed-chamber a large chest, which he said he had once had full of gold; upon which Brown observed, &ldquo;I am glad you can bear it so near your bed-chamber.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">We talked of the state of the poor in London. &mdash; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Saunders Welch, the Justice, who was once High-Constable of Holborn, and had the best opportunities of knowing the state of the poor, told me, that I under-rated the number, when I computed that twenty a week, that is, above a thousand a year, died of hunger; not absolutely of immediate hunger; but of the wasting and other diseases which are the consequences of hunger. This happens only in so large a place as London, where people are not known. What we are told about the great sums got by begging is not true: the trade is overstocked. And, you may depend upon it, there are many who cannot get work. A particular kind of manufacture fails: those who have been used to work at it, can, for some time, work at nothing else. You meet a man begging; you charge him with idleness: he says, &ldquo;I am willing to labour. Will you give me work?&rdquo;&mdash; &ldquo;I cannot.&rdquo;&mdash; &ldquo;Why, then you have no right to charge me with idleness.&rdquo;&rsquo; We left Mr. Strahan&rsquo;s at seven, as Johnson had said he intended to go to evening prayers. As we walked along, he complained of a little gout in his toe, and said, &lsquo;I shan&rsquo;t go to prayers to-night; I shall go to-morrow: Whenever I miss church on a Sunday, I resolve to go another day. But I do not always do it.&rsquo; This was a fair exhibition of that vibration between pious resolutions and indolence, which many of us have too often experienced.</p>
<p class="p24">I went home with him, and we had a long quiet conversation.</p>
<p class="p24">BOSWELL. &lsquo;Why, Sir, do people play this trick which I observe now, when I look at your grate, putting the shovel against it to make the fire burn?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;They play the trick, but it does not make the fire burn. THERE is a better; (setting the poker perpendicularly up at right angles with the grate.) In days of superstition they thought, as it made a cross with the bars, it would drive away the witch.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">BOSWELL. &lsquo;By associating with you, Sir, I am always getting an accession of wisdom. But perhaps a man, after knowing his own character &mdash; the limited strength of his own mind, should not be desirous of having too much wisdom, considering, quid valeant humeri, how little he can carry.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, be as wise as you can; let a man be aliis laetus, sapiens sibi:</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Though pleas&rsquo;d to see the dolphins play,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mind my compass and my way.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">You may be wise in your study in the morning, and gay in company at a tavern in the evening. Every man is to take care of his own wisdom and his own virtue, without minding too much what others think.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He said, &lsquo;Dodsley first mentioned to me the scheme of an English Dictionary; but I had long thought of it.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;You did not know what you were undertaking.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Yes, Sir, I knew very well what I was undertaking, &mdash; and very well how to do it, &mdash; and have done it very well.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;An excellent climax! and it HAS availed you. In your Preface you say, &ldquo;What would it avail me in this gloom of solitude?&rdquo; You have been agreeably mistaken.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">In his Life of Milton he observes, &lsquo;I cannot but remark a kind of respect, perhaps unconsciously, paid to this great man by his biographers: every house in which he resided is historically mentioned, as if it were an injury to neglect naming any place that he honoured by his presence.&rsquo; I had, before I read this observation, been desirous of shewing that respect to Johnson, by various inquiries. Finding him this evening in a very good humour, I prevailed on him to give me an exact list of his places of residence, since he entered the metropolis as an authour, which I subjoin in a note.*</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* 1.&nbsp; Exeter-street, off Catherine-street, Strand.&nbsp; 2.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Greenwich. 3.&nbsp; Woodstock-street, near Hanover-square.&nbsp; 4.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Castle-street, Cavendish-square, No. 6.&nbsp; 5.&nbsp; Strand.&nbsp; 6.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boswell-Court.&nbsp; 7. Strand, again.&nbsp; 8.&nbsp; Bow-street.&nbsp; 9.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Holborn.&nbsp; 10.&nbsp; Fetter-lane. 11.&nbsp; Holborn, again.&nbsp; 12.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gough-square.&nbsp; 13.&nbsp; Staple Inn.&nbsp; 14. Gray&rsquo;s Inn.&nbsp; 15.&nbsp; Inner</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Temple-lane, No. 1.&nbsp; 16.&nbsp; Johnson&rsquo;s-court, No. 7.&nbsp; 17.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bolt-court.&nbsp; No. 8. &mdash; BOSWELL.</p>
<p class="p24">On Tuesday, October 12, I dined with him at Mr. Ramsay&rsquo;s, with Lord Newhaven, and some other company, none of whom I recollect, but a beautiful Miss Graham, a relation of his Lordship&rsquo;s, who asked Dr. Johnson to hob or nob with her. He was flattered by such pleasing attention, and politely told her, he never drank wine; but if she would drink a glass of water, he was much at her service. She accepted. &lsquo;Oho, Sir! (said Lord Newhaven,) you are caught.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Nay, I do not see HOW I am CAUGHT; but if I am caught, I don&rsquo;t want to get free again. If I am caught, I hope to be kept.&rsquo; Then when the two glasses of water were brought, smiling placidly to the young lady, he said, &lsquo;Madam, let us RECIPROCATE.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Lord Newhaven and Johnson carried on an argument for some time, concerning the Middlesex election. Johnson said, &lsquo;Parliament may be considered as bound by law as a man is bound where there is nobody to tie the knot. As it is clear that the House of Commons may expel and expel again and again, why not allow of the power to incapacitate for that parliament, rather than have a perpetual contest kept up between parliament and the people.&rsquo; Lord Newhaven took the opposite side; but respectfully said, &lsquo;I speak with great deference to you, Dr. Johnson; I speak to be instructed.&rsquo; This had its full effect on my friend. He bowed his head almost as low as the table, to a complimenting nobleman; and called out, &lsquo;My Lord, my Lord, I do not desire all this ceremony; let us tell our minds to one another quietly.&rsquo; After the debate was over, he said, &lsquo;I have got lights on the subject to-day, which I had not before.&rsquo; This was a great deal from him, especially as he had written a pamphlet upon it.</p>
<p class="p24">Of his fellow-collegian, the celebrated Mr. George Whitefield, he said, &lsquo;Whitefield never drew as much attention as a mountebank does; he did not draw attention by doing better than others, but by doing what was strange. Were Astley to preach a sermon standing upon his head on a horse&rsquo;s back, he would collect a multitude to hear him; but no wise man would say he had made a better sermon for that. I never treated Whitefield&rsquo;s ministry with contempt; I believe he did good. He had devoted himself to the lower classes of mankind, and among them he was of use. But when familiarity and noise claim the praise due to knowledge, art, and elegance, we must beat down such pretensions.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">What I have preserved of his conversation during the remainder of my stay in London at this time, is only what follows: I told him that when I objected to keeping company with a notorious infidel, a celebrated friend of ours said to me, &lsquo;I do not think that men who live laxly in the world, as you and I do, can with propriety assume such an authority. Dr. Johnson may, who is uniformly exemplary in his conduct. But it is not very consistent to shun an infidel to-day, and get drunk to-morrow.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Nay, Sir, this is sad reasoning. Because a man cannot be right in all things, is he to be right in nothing? Because a man sometimes gets drunk, is he therefore to steal? This doctrine would very soon bring a man to the gallows.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He, I know not why, shewed upon all occasions an aversion to go to Ireland, where I proposed to him that we should make a tour. JOHNSON. &lsquo;It is the last place where I should wish to travel.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Should you not like to see Dublin, Sir?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;No, Sir! Dublin is only a worse capital.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Is not the Giant&rsquo;s-Causeway worth seeing?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Worth seeing? yes; but not worth going to see.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Yet he had a kindness for the Irish nation, and thus generously expressed himself to a gentleman from that country, on the subject of an UNION which artful Politicians have often had in view&mdash; &lsquo;Do not make an union with us, Sir. We should unite with you, only to rob you. We should have robbed the Scotch, if they had had any thing of which we could have robbed them.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Of an acquaintance of ours, whose manners and every thing about him, though expensive, were coarse, he said, &lsquo;Sir, you see in him vulgar prosperity.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">A foreign minister of no very high talents, who had been in his company for a considerable time quite overlooked, happened luckily to mention that he had read some of his Rambler in Italian, and admired it much. This pleased him greatly; he observed that the title had been translated, Il Genio errante, though I have been told it was rendered more ludicrously, Il Vagabondo; and finding that this minister gave such a proof of his taste, he was all attention to him, and on the first remark which he made, however simple, exclaimed, &lsquo;The Ambassadour says well &mdash; His Excellency observes&mdash; &lsquo; And then he expanded and enriched the little that had been said, in so strong a manner, that it appeared something of consequence. This was exceedingly entertaining to the company who were present, and many a time afterwards it furnished a pleasant topick of merriment: &lsquo;The Ambassadour says well,&rsquo; became a laughable term of applause, when no mighty matter had been expressed.</p>
<p class="p24">I left London on Monday, October 15, and accompanied Colonel Stuart to Chester, where his regiment was to lye for some time.</p>
<p class="p24">1780: AETAT. 71.] &mdash; In 1780, the world was kept in impatience for the completion of his Lives of the Poets, upon which he was employed so far as his indolence allowed him to labour.</p>
<p class="p24">His friend Dr. Lawrence having now suffered the greatest affliction to which a man is liable, and which Johnson himself had felt in the most severe manner; Johnson wrote to him in an admirable strain of sympathy and pious consolation.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;TO DR. LAWRENCE.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;DEAR SIR, &mdash; At a time when all your friends ought to shew their kindness, and with a character which ought to make all that know you your friends, you may wonder that you have yet heard nothing from me.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I have been hindered by a vexatious and incessant cough, for which within these ten days I have been bled once, fasted four or five times, taken physick five times, and opiates, I think, six. This day it seems to remit.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The loss, dear Sir, which you have lately suffered, I felt many years ago, and know therefore how much has been taken from you, and how little help can be had from consolation. He that outlives a wife whom he has long loved, sees himself disjoined from the only mind that has the same hopes, and fears, and interest; from the only companion with whom he has shared much good or evil; and with whom he could set his mind at liberty, to retrace the past or anticipate the future. The continuity of being is lacerated; the settled course of sentiment and action is stopped; and life stands suspended and motionless, till it is driven by external causes into a new channel. But the time of suspense is dreadful.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Our first recourse in this distressed solitude, is, perhaps for want of habitual piety, to a gloomy acquiescence in necessity. Of two mortal beings, one must lose the other; but surely there is a higher and better comfort to be drawn from the consideration of that Providence which watches over all, and a belief that the living and the dead are equally in the hands of God, who will reunite those whom he has separated; or who sees that it is best not to reunite. I am, dear Sir, your most affectionate, and most humble servant,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;January 20, 1780.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On the 2nd of May I wrote to him, and requested that we might have another meeting somewhere in the North of England, in the autumn of this year.</p>
<p class="p24">From Mr. Langton I received soon after this time a letter, of which I extract a passage, relative both to Mr. Beauclerk and Dr. Johnson.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The melancholy information you have received concerning Mr. Beauclerk&rsquo;s death is true. Had his talents been directed in any sufficient degree as they ought, I have always been strongly of opinion that they were calculated to make an illustrious figure; and that opinion, as it had been in part formed upon Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s judgment, receives more and more confirmation by hearing what, since his death, Dr. Johnson has said concerning them; a few evenings ago, he was at Mr. Vesey&rsquo;s, where Lord Althorpe, who was one of a numerous company there, addressed Dr. Johnson on the subject of Mr. Beauclerk&rsquo;s death, saying, &ldquo;Our CLUB has had a great loss since we met last.&rdquo; He replied, &ldquo;A loss, that perhaps the whole nation could not repair!&rdquo; The Doctor then went on to speak of his endowments, and particularly extolled the wonderful ease with which he uttered what was highly excellent. He said, that &ldquo;no man ever was so free when he was going to say a good thing, from a LOOK that expressed that it was coming; or, when he had said it, from a look that expressed that it had come.&rdquo; At Mr. Thrale&rsquo;s, some days before when we were talking on the same subject, he said, referring to the same idea of his wonderful facility, &ldquo;That Beauclerk&rsquo;s talents were those which he had felt himself more disposed to envy, than those of any whom he had known.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;On the evening I have spoken of above, at Mr. Vesey&rsquo;s, you would have been much gratified, as it exhibited an instance of the high importance in which Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s character is held, I think even beyond any I ever before was witness to. The company consisted chiefly of ladies, among whom were the Duchess Dowager of Portland, the Duchess of Beaufort, whom I suppose from her rank I must name before her mother Mrs. Boscawen, and her elder sister Mrs. Lewson, who was likewise there; Lady Lucan, Lady Clermont, and others of note both for their station and understandings. Among the gentlemen were Lord Althorpe, whom I have before named, Lord Macartney, Sir Joshua Reynolds, Lord Lucan, Mr. Wraxal, whose book you have probably seen, The Tour to the Northern Parts of Europe; a very agreeable ingenious man; Dr. Warren, Mr. Pepys, the Master in Chancery, whom I believe you know, and Dr. Barnard, the Provost of Eton. As soon as Dr. Johnson was come in and had taken a chair, the company began to collect round him, till they became not less than four, if not five, deep; those behind standing, and listening over the heads of those that were sitting near him. The conversation for some time was chiefly between Dr. Johnson and the Provost of Eton, while the others contributed occasionally their remarks.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On his birth-day, Johnson has this note: &lsquo;I am now beginning the seventy-second year of my life, with more strength of body, and greater vigour of mind, than I think is common at that age.&rsquo; But still he complains of sleepless nights and idle days, and forgetfulness, or neglect of resolutions. He thus pathetically expresses himself,&mdash; &lsquo;Surely I shall not spend my whole life with my own total disapprobation.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Mr. Macbean, whom I have mentioned more than once, as one of Johnson&rsquo;s humble friends, a deserving but unfortunate man, being now oppressed by age and poverty, Johnson solicited the Lord Chancellor Thurlow, to have him admitted into the Charterhouse. I take the liberty to insert his Lordship&rsquo;s answer, as I am eager to embrace every occasion of augmenting the respectable notion which should ever be entertained of my illustrious friend: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;TO DR. SAMUEL JOHNSON.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;London, October 24, 1780.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I have this moment received your letter, dated the 19th, and returned from Bath.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;In the beginning of the summer I placed one in the Chartreux, without the sanction of a recommendation so distinct and so authoritative as yours of Macbean; and I am afraid, that according to the establishment of the House, the opportunity of making the charity so good amends will not soon recur. But whenever a vacancy shall happen, if you&rsquo;ll favour me with notice of it, I will try to recommend him to the place, even though it should not be my turn to nominate. I am, Sir, with great regard, your most faithful and obedient servant,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;THURLOW.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Being disappointed in my hopes of meeting Johnson this year, so that I could hear none of his admirable sayings, I shall compensate for this want by inserting a collection of them, for which I am indebted to my worthy friend Mr. Langton, whose kind communications have been separately interwoven in many parts of this work. Very few articles of this collection were committed to writing by himself, he not having that habit; which he regrets, and which those who know the numerous opportunities he had of gathering the rich fruits of Johnsonian wit and wisdom, must ever regret. I however found, in conversations with him, that a good store of Johnsoniana was treasured in his mind; and I compared it to Herculaneum, or some old Roman field, which when dug, fully rewards the labour employed. The authenticity of every article is unquestionable. For the expression, I, who wrote them down in his presence, am partly answerable.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;There is nothing more likely to betray a man into absurdity than CONDESCENSION; when he seems to suppose his understanding too powerful for his company.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Having asked Mr. Langton if his father and mother had sat for their pictures, which he thought it right for each generation of a family to do, and being told they had opposed it, he said, &ldquo;Sir, among the anfractuosities of the human mind, I know not if it may not be one, that there is a superstitious reluctance to sit for a picture.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;John Gilbert Cooper related, that soon after the publication of his Dictionary, Garrick being asked by Johnson what people said of it, told him, that among other animadversions, it was objected that he cited authorities which were beneath the dignity of such a work, and mentioned Richardson. &ldquo;Nay, (said Johnson,) I have done worse than that: I have cited THEE, David.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;When in good humour he would talk of his own writings with a wonderful frankness and candour, and would even criticise them with the closest severity. One day, having read over one of his Ramblers, Mr. Langton asked him, how he liked that paper; he shook his head, and answered, &ldquo;too wordy.&rdquo; At another time, when one was reading his tragedy of Irene to a company at a house in the country, he left the room; and somebody having asked him the reason of this, he replied, &ldquo;Sir, I thought it had been better.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;He related, that he had once in a dream a contest of wit with some other person, and that he was very much mortified by imagining that his opponent had the better of him. &ldquo;Now, (said he,) one may mark here the effect of sleep in weakening the power of reflection; for had not my judgement failed me, I should have seen, that the wit of this supposed antagonist, by whose superiority I felt myself depressed, was as much furnished by me, as that which I thought I had been uttering in my own character.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Of Sir Joshua Reynolds, he said, &ldquo;Sir, I know no man who has passed through life with more observation than Reynolds.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;He repeated to Mr. Langton, with great energy, in the Greek, our SAVIOUR&rsquo;S gracious expression concerning the forgiveness of Mary Magdalen, &lsquo;[Greek text omitted]. &ldquo;Thy faith hath saved thee; go in peace.&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;the manner of this dismission is exceedingly affecting.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Talking of the Farce of High Life below Stairs, he said, &ldquo;Here is a Farce, which is really very diverting when you see it acted; and yet one may read it, and not know that one has been reading any thing at all.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;He used at one time to go occasionally to the green room of Drury-lane Theatre, where he was much regarded by the players, and was very easy and facetious with them. He had a very high opinion of Mrs. Clive&rsquo;s comick powers, and conversed more with her than with any of them. He said, &ldquo;Clive, Sir, is a good thing to sit by; she always understands what you say.&rdquo; And she said of him, &ldquo;I love to sit by Dr. Johnson; he always entertains me.&rdquo; One night, when The Recruiting Officer was acted, he said to Mr. Holland, who had been expressing an apprehension that Dr. Johnson would disdain the works of Farquhar; &ldquo;No, Sir, I think Farquhar a man whose writings have considerable merit.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;His friend Garrick was so busy in conducting the drama, that they could not have so much intercourse as Mr. Garrick used to profess an anxious wish that there should be. There might, indeed, be something in the contemptuous severity as to the merit of acting, which his old preceptor nourished in himself, that would mortify Garrick after the great applause which he received from the audience. For though Johnson said of him, &ldquo;Sir, a man who has a nation to admire him every night, may well be expected to be somewhat elated;&rdquo; yet he would treat theatrical matters with a ludicrous slight. He mentioned one evening, &ldquo;I met David coming off the stage, drest in a woman&rsquo;s riding-hood, when he acted in The Wonder; I came full upon him, and I believe he was not pleased.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Once he asked Tom Davies, whom he saw drest in a fine suit of clothes, &ldquo;And what art thou to-night?&rdquo; Tom answered, &ldquo;The Thane of Ross;&rdquo; (which it will be recollected is a very inconsiderable character.) &ldquo;O brave!&rdquo; said Johnson.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Of Mr. Longley, at Rochester, a gentleman of very considerable learning, whom Dr. Johnson met there, he said, &ldquo;My heart warms towards him. I was surprised to find in him such a nice acquaintance with the metre in the learned languages; though I was somewhat mortified that I had it not so much to myself, as I should have thought.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Talking of the minuteness with which people will record the sayings of eminent persons, a story was told, that when Pope was on a visit to Spence at Oxford, as they looked from the window they saw a Gentleman Commoner, who was just come in from riding, amusing himself with whipping at a post. Pope took occasion to say, &ldquo;That young gentleman seems to have little to do.&rdquo; Mr. Beauclerk observed, &ldquo;Then, to be sure, Spence turned round and wrote that down;&rdquo; and went on to say to Dr. Johnson, &ldquo;Pope, Sir, would have said the same of you, if he had seen you distilling.&rdquo; JOHNSON. &ldquo;Sir, if Pope had told me of my distilling, I would have told him of his grotto.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;He would allow no settled indulgence of idleness upon principle, and always repelled every attempt to urge excuses for it. A friend one day suggested, that it was not wholesome to study soon after dinner. JOHNSON. &ldquo;Ah, Sir, don&rsquo;t give way to such a fancy. At one time of my life I had taken it into my head that it was not wholesome to study between breakfast and dinner.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Dr. Goldsmith, upon occasion of Mrs. Lennox&rsquo;s bringing out a play, said to Dr. Johnson at THE CLUB, that a person had advised him to go and hiss it, because she had attacked Shakspeare in her book called Shakspeare Illustrated. JOHNSON. &ldquo;And did not you tell him he was a rascal?&rdquo; GOLDSMITH. &ldquo;No, Sir, I did not. Perhaps he might not mean what he said.&rdquo; JOHNSON. &ldquo;Nay, Sir, if he lied, it is a different thing.&rdquo; Colman slily said, (but it is believed Dr. Johnson did not hear him,) &ldquo;Then the proper expression should have been, &mdash; Sir, if you don&rsquo;t lie, you&rsquo;re a rascal.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;His affection for Topham Beauclerk was so great, that when Beauclerk was labouring under that severe illness which at last occasioned his death, Johnson said, (with a voice faultering with emotion,) &ldquo;Sir, I would walk to the extent of the diameter of the earth to save Beauclerk.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Johnson was well acquainted with Mr. Dossie, authour of a treatise on Agriculture; and said of him, &ldquo;Sir, of the objects which the Society of Arts have chiefly in view, the chymical effects of bodies operating upon other bodies, he knows more than almost any man.&rdquo; Johnson, in order to give Mr. Dossie his vote to be a member of this Society, paid up an arrear which had run on for two years. On this occasion he mentioned a circumstance as characteristick of the Scotch. &ldquo;One of that nation, (said he,) who had been a candidate, against whom I had voted, came up to me with a civil salutation. Now, Sir, this is their way. An Englishman would have stomached it, and been sulky, and never have taken further notice of you; but a Scotchman, Sir, though you vote nineteen times against him, will accost you with equal complaisance after each time, and the twentieth time, Sir, he will get your vote.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Talking on the subject of toleration, one day when some friends were with him in his study, he made his usual remark, that the State has a right to regulate the religion of the people, who are the children of the State. A clergyman having readily acquiesced in this, Johnson, who loved discussion, observed, &ldquo;But, Sir, you must go round to other States than your own. You do not know what a Bramin has to say for himself. In short, Sir, I have got no further than this: Every man has a right to utter what he thinks truth, and every other man has a right to knock him down for it. Martyrdom is the test.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Goldsmith one day brought to THE CLUB a printed Ode, which he, with others, had been hearing read by its authour in a publick room at the rate of five shillings each for admission. One of the company having read it aloud, Dr. Johnson said, &ldquo;Bolder words and more timorous meaning, I think never were brought together.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Talking of Gray&rsquo;s Odes, he said, &ldquo;They are forced plants raised in a hot-bed; and they are poor plants; they are but cucumbers after all.&rdquo; A gentleman present, who had been running down Ode-writing in general, as a bad species of poetry, unluckily said, &ldquo;Had they been literally cucumbers, they had been better things than Odes.&rdquo;&mdash; &ldquo;Yes, Sir, (said Johnson,) for a HOG.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;It is very remarkable, that he retained in his memory very slight and trivial, as well as important things. As an instance of this, it seems that an inferiour domestick of the Duke of Leeds had attempted to celebrate his Grace&rsquo;s marriage in such homely rhimes as he could make; and this curious composition having been sung to Dr. Johnson he got it by heart, and used to repeat it in a very pleasant manner. Two of the stanzas were these: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;When the Duke of Leeds shall married be</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To a fine young lady of high quality,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How happy will that gentlewoman be</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his Grace of Leeds&rsquo;s good company.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She shall have all that&rsquo;s fine and fair,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the best of silk and satin shall wear;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And ride in a coach to take the air,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And have a house in St. James&rsquo;s-square.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">To hear a man, of the weight and dignity of Johnson, repeating such humble attempts at poetry, had a very amusing effect. He, however, seriously observed of the last stanza repeated by him, that it nearly comprized all the advantages that wealth can give.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;An eminent foreigner, when he was shewn the British Museum, was very troublesome with many absurd inquiries. &ldquo;Now there, Sir, (said he,) is the difference between an Englishman and a Frenchman. A Frenchman must be always talking, whether he knows any thing of the matter or not; an Englishman is content to say nothing, when he has nothing to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;His unjust contempt for foreigners was, indeed, extreme. One evening, at old Slaughter&rsquo;s coffee-house, when a number of them were talking loud about little matters, he said, &ldquo;Does not this confirm old Meynell&rsquo;s observation &mdash; For any thing I see, foreigners are fools.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;He said, that once, when he had a violent tooth-ache, a Frenchman accosted him thus:&mdash; &ldquo;Ah, Monsieur vous etudiez trop.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Colman, in a note on his translation of Terence, talking of Shakspeare&rsquo;s learning, asks, &ldquo;What says Farmer to this? What says Johnson?&rdquo; Upon this he observed, &ldquo;Sir, let Farmer answer for himself: I never engaged in this controversy. I always said, Shakspeare had Latin enough to grammaticise his English.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;A clergyman, whom he characterised as one who loved to say little oddities, was affecting one day, at a Bishop&rsquo;s table, a sort of slyness and freedom not in character, and repeated, as if part of The Old Man&rsquo;s Wish, a song by Dr. Walter Pope, a verse bordering on licentiousness. Johnson rebuked him in the finest manner, by first shewing him that he did not know the passage he was aiming at, and thus humbling him:</p>
<p class="p24">&ldquo;Sir, that is not the song: it is thus.&rdquo; And he gave it right. Then looking stedfastly on him, &ldquo;Sir, there is a part of that song which I should wish to exemplify in my own life: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&ldquo;May I govern my passions with absolute sway!&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;He used frequently to observe, that men might be very eminent in a profession, without our perceiving any particular power of mind in them in conversation. &ldquo;It seems strange (said he,) that a man should see so far to the right, who sees so short a way to the left. Burke is the only man whose common conversation corresponds with the general fame which he has in the world. Take up whatever topick you please, he is ready to meet you.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Mr. Langton, when a very young man, read Dodsley&rsquo;s Cleone, a Tragedy, to him, not aware of his extreme impatience to be read to. As it went on he turned his face to the back of his chair, and put himself into various attitudes, which marked his uneasiness. At the end of an act, however, he said, &ldquo;Come let&rsquo;s have some more, let&rsquo;s go into the slaughter-house again, Lanky. But I am afraid there is more blood than brains.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Snatches of reading (said he,) will not make a Bentley or a Clarke. They are, however, in a certain degree advantageous. I would put a child into a library (where no unfit books are) and let him read at his choice. A child should not be discouraged from reading any thing that he takes a liking to, from a notion that it is above his reach. If that be the ease, the child will soon find it out and desist; if not, he of course gains the instruction; which is so much the more likely to come, from the inclination with which he takes up the study.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;A gentleman who introduced his brother to Dr. Johnson was earnest to recommend him to the Doctor&rsquo;s notice, which he did by saying, &ldquo;When we have sat together some time, you&rsquo;ll find my brother grow very entertaining.&rdquo;&mdash; &ldquo;Sir, (said Johnson,) I can wait.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;In the latter part of his life, in order to satisfy himself whether his mental faculties were impaired, he resolved that he would try to learn a new language, and fixed upon the Low Dutch, for that purpose, and this he continued till he had read about one half of Thomas a Kempis; and finding that there appeared no abatement of his power of acquisition, he then desisted, as thinking the experiment had been duly tried.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Mr. Langton and he having gone to see a Freemason&rsquo;s funeral procession, when they were at Rochester, and some solemn musick being played on French horns, he said, &ldquo;This is the first time that I have ever been affected by musical sounds;&rdquo; adding, &ldquo;that the impression made upon him was of a melancholy kind.&rdquo; Mr. Langton saying, that this effect was a fine one, &mdash; JOHNSON. &ldquo;Yes, if it softens the mind, so as to prepare it for the reception of salutary feelings, it may be good: but inasmuch as it is melancholy per se, it is bad.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Goldsmith had long a visionary project, that some time or other when his circumstances should be easier, he would go to Aleppo, in order to acquire a knowledge as far as might be of any arts peculiar to the East, and introduce them into Britain. When this was talked of in Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s company, he said, &ldquo;Of all men Goldsmith is the most unfit to go out upon such an inquiry; for he is utterly ignorant of such arts as we already possess, and consequently could not know what would be accessions to our present stock of mechanical knowledge. Sir, he would bring home a grinding barrow, which you see in every street in London, and think that he had furnished a wonderful improvement.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Greek, Sir, (said he,) is like lace; every man gets as much of it as he can.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Johnson one day gave high praise to Dr. Bentley&rsquo;s verses in Dodsley&rsquo;s Collection, which he recited with his usual energy. Dr. Adam Smith, who was present, observed in his decisive professorial manner, &ldquo;Very well &mdash; Very well.&rdquo; Johnson however added, &ldquo;Yes, they ARE very well, Sir; but you may observe in what manner they are well. They are the forcible verses of a man of a strong mind, but not accustomed to write verse; for there is some uncouthness in the expression.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Drinking tea one day at Garrick&rsquo;s with Mr. Langton, he was questioned if he was not somewhat of a heretick as to Shakspeare; said Garrick, &ldquo;I doubt he is a little of an infidel.&rdquo;&mdash; &ldquo;Sir, (said Johnson,) I will stand by the lines I have written on Shakspeare in my Prologue at the opening of your Theatre.&rdquo; Mr. Langton suggested, that in the line</p>
<p class="p24">&ldquo;And panting Time toil&rsquo;d after him in vain,&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson might have had in his eye the passage in The Tempest, where Prospero says of Miranda,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo; &mdash;&mdash; She will outstrip all praise,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And make it halt behind her.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson said nothing. Garrick then ventured to observe, &ldquo;I do not think that the happiest line in the praise of Shakspeare.&rdquo; Johnson exclaimed (smiling,) &ldquo;Prosaical rogues! next time I write, I&rsquo;ll make both time and space pant.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;It is well known that there was formerly a rude custom for those who were sailing upon the Thames, to accost each other as they passed, in the most abusive language they could invent, generally, however, with as much satirical humour as they were capable of producing. Addison gives a specimen of this ribaldry, in Number 383 of The Spectator, when Sir Roger de Coverly and he are going to Spring-garden. Johnson was once eminently successful in this species of contest; a fellow having attacked him with some coarse raillery, Johnson answered him thus, &ldquo;Sir, your wife, under pretence of keeping a bawdy-house, is a receiver of stolen goods.&rdquo; One evening when he and Mr. Burke and Mr. Langton were in company together, and the admirable scolding of Timon of Athens was mentioned, this instance of Johnson&rsquo;s was quoted, and thought to have at least equal excellence.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;As Johnson always allowed the extraordinary talents of Mr. Burke, so Mr. Burke was fully sensible of the wonderful powers of Johnson. Mr. Langton recollects having passed an evening with both of them, when Mr. Burke repeatedly entered upon topicks which it was evident he would have illustrated with extensive knowledge and richness of expression; but Johnson always seized upon the conversation, in which, however, he acquitted himself in a most masterly manner. As Mr. Burke and Mr. Langton were walking home, Mr. Burke observed that Johnson had been very great that night; Mr. Langton joined in this, but added, he could have wished to hear more from another person; (plainly intimating that he meant Mr. Burke.) &ldquo;O, no (said Mr. Burke,) it is enough for me to have rung the bell to him.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Beauclerk having observed to him of one of their friends, that he was aukward at counting money, &ldquo;Why, Sir, (said Johnson,) I am likewise aukward at counting money. But then, Sir, the reason is plain; I have had very little money to count.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Goldsmith, upon being visited by Johnson one day in the Temple, said to him with a little jealousy of the appearance of his accommodation, &ldquo;I shall soon be in better chambers than these.&rdquo; Johnson at the same time checked him and paid him a handsome compliment, implying that a man of his talents should be above attention to such distinctions,&mdash; &ldquo;Nay, Sir, never mind that. Nil te quaesiveris extra.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;When Mr. Vesey was proposed as a member of The LITERARY CLUB, Mr. Burke began by saying that he was a man of gentle manners. &ldquo;Sir, (said Johnson,) you need say no more. When you have said a man of gentle manners; you have said enough.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The late Mr. Fitzherbert told Mr. Langton that Johnson said to him, &ldquo;Sir, a man has no more right to SAY an uncivil thing, than to ACT one; no more right to say a rude thing to another than to knock him down&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Richardson had little conversation, except about his own works, of which Sir Joshua Reynolds said he was always willing to talk, and glad to have them introduced. Johnson when he carried Mr. Langton to see him, professed that he could bring him out into conversation, and used this allusive expression, &ldquo;Sir, I can make him REAR.&rdquo; But he failed; for in that interview Richardson said little else than that there lay in the room a translation of his Clarissa into German.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Once when somebody produced a newspaper in which there was a letter of stupid abuse of Sir Joshua Reynolds, of which Johnson himself came in for a share,&mdash; &ldquo;Pray,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;let us have it read aloud from beginning to end;&rdquo; which being done, he with a ludicrous earnestness, and not directing his look to any particular person, called out, &ldquo;Are we alive after all this satire!&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Of Dr. Goldsmith he said, &ldquo;No man was more foolish when he had not a pen in his hand, or more wise when he had.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;An observation of Bathurst&rsquo;s may be mentioned, which Johnson repeated, appearing to acknowledge it to be well founded, namely, it was somewhat remarkable how seldom, on occasion of coming into the company of any new person, one felt any wish or inclination to see him again.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">1781: AETAT. 72.] &mdash; In 1781 Johnson at last completed his Lives of the Poets, of which he gives this account: &lsquo;Some time in March I finished the Lives of the Poets, which I wrote in my usual way, dilatorily and hastily, unwilling to work, and working with vigour and haste.&rsquo; In a memorandum previous to this, he says of them: &lsquo;Written, I hope, in such a manner as may tend to the promotion of piety.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">The booksellers, justly sensible of the great additional value of the copy-right, presented him with another hundred pounds, over and above two hundred, for which his agreement was to furnish such prefaces as he thought fit.</p>
<p class="p24">As he was so good as to make me a present of the greatest part of the original and indeed only manuscript of this admirable work, I have an opportunity of observing with wonder, the correctness with which he rapidly struck off such glowing composition.</p>
<p class="p24">The Life of COWLEY he himself considered as the best of the whole, on account of the dissertation which it contains on the Metaphysical Poets.</p>
<p class="p24">While the world in general was filled with admiration of Johnson&rsquo;s Lives of the Poets, there were narrow circles in which prejudice and resentment were fostered, and from which attacks of different sorts issued against him. By some violent Whigs he was arraigned of injustice to Milton; by some Cambridge men of depreciating Gray; and his expressing with a dignified freedom what he really thought of George, Lord Lyttelton, gave offence to some of the friends of that nobleman, and particularly produced a declaration of war against him from Mrs. Montagu, the ingenious Essayist on Shakspeare, between whom and his Lordship a commerce of reciprocal compliments had long been carried on. In this war the smaller powers in alliance with him were of course led to engage, at least on the defensive, and thus I for one was excluded from the enjoyment of &lsquo;A Feast of Reason,&rsquo; such as Mr. Cumberland has described, with a keen, yet just and delicate pen, in his Observer. These minute inconveniences gave not the least disturbance to Johnson. He nobly said, when I talked to him of the feeble, though shrill outcry which had been raised, &lsquo;Sir, I considered myself as entrusted with a certain portion of truth. I have given my opinion sincerely; let them shew where they think me wrong.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I wrote to him in February, complaining of having been troubled by a recurrence of the perplexing question of Liberty and Necessity; &mdash; and mentioning that I hoped soon to meet him again in London.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;TO JAMES BOSWELL, ESQ.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;DEAR SIR, &mdash; I hoped you had got rid of all this hypocrisy of misery. What have you to do with Liberty and Necessity? Or what more than to hold your tongue about it? Do not doubt but I shall be most heartily glad to see you here again, for I love every part about you but your affectation of distress.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I have at last finished my Lives, and have laid up for you a load of copy, all out of order, so that it will amuse you a long time to set it right. Come to me, my dear Bozzy, and let us be as happy as we can. We will go again to the Mitre, and talk old times over. I am, dear Sir, yours affectionately,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;March 14, 1781.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Monday, March 19, I arrived in London, and on Tuesday, the 20th, met him in Fleet-street, walking, or rather indeed moving along; for his peculiar march is thus described in a very just and picturesque manner, in a short Life of him published very soon after his death:&mdash; &lsquo;When he walked the streets, what with the constant roll of his head, and the concomitant motion of his body, he appeared to make his way by that motion, independent of his feet.&rsquo; That he was often much stared at while he advanced in this manner, may easily be believed; but it was not safe to make sport of one so robust as he was. Mr. Langton saw him one day, in a fit of absence, by a sudden start, drive the load off a porter&rsquo;s back, and walk forward briskly, without being conscious of what he had done. The porter was very angry, but stood still, and eyed the huge figure with much earnestness, till he was satisfied that his wisest course was to be quiet, and take up his burthen again.</p>
<p class="p24">Our accidental meeting in the street after a long separation was a pleasing surprize to us both. He stepped aside with me into Falcon-court, and made kind inquiries about my family, and as we were in a hurry going different ways, I promised to call on him next day; he said he was engaged to go out in the morning. &lsquo;Early, Sir?&rsquo; said I. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, a London morning does not go with the sun.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I waited on him next evening, and he gave me a great portion of his original manuscript of his Lives of the Poets, which he had preserved for me.</p>
<p class="p24">I found on visiting his friend, Mr. Thrale, that he was now very ill, and had removed, I suppose by the solicitation of Mrs. Thrale, to a house in Grosvenor-square. I was sorry to see him sadly changed in his appearance.</p>
<p class="p24">He told me I might now have the pleasure to see Dr. Johnson drink wine again, for he had lately returned to it. When I mentioned this to Johnson, he said, &lsquo;I drink it now sometimes, but not socially.&rsquo; The first evening that I was with him at Thrale&rsquo;s, I observed he poured a large quantity of it into a glass, and swallowed it greedily. Every thing about his character and manners was forcible and violent; there never was any moderation; many a day did he fast, many a year did he refrain from wine; but when he did eat, it was voraciously; when he did drink wine, it was copiously. He could practise abstinence, but not temperance.</p>
<p class="p24">Mrs. Thrale and I had a dispute, whether Shakspeare or Milton had drawn the most admirable picture of a man.* I was for Shakspeare; Mrs. Thrale for Milton; and after a fair hearing, Johnson decided for my opinion.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* The passages considered, according to Boswell&rsquo;s note, were</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the portrait of Hamlet&rsquo;s father (Ham. 3. 4. 55-62), and the</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;portrait of Adam (P. L. 4. 300-303). &mdash; ED.</p>
<p class="p24">I told him of one of Mr. Burke&rsquo;s playful sallies upon Dean Marlay: &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t like the Deanery of Ferns, it sounds so like a BARREN title.&rsquo;&mdash; &lsquo;Dr. HEATH should have it;&rsquo; said I. Johnson laughed, and condescending to trifle in the same mode of conceit, suggested Dr. MOSS.</p>
<p class="p24">He said, &lsquo;Mrs. Montagu has dropt me. Now, Sir, there are people whom one should like very well to drop, but would not wish to be dropped by.&rsquo; He certainly was vain of the society of ladies, and could make himself very agreeable to them, when he chose it; Sir Joshua Reynolds agreed with me that he could. Mr. Gibbon, with his usual sneer, controverted it, perhaps in resentment of Johnson&rsquo;s having talked with some disgust of his ugliness, which one would think a PHILOSOPHER would not mind. Dean Marlay wittily observed, &lsquo;A lady may be vain, when she can turn a wolf-dog into a lap-dog.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">His notion of the duty of a member of Parliament, sitting upon an election-committee, was very high; and when he was told of a gentleman upon one of those committees, who read the newspapers part of the time, and slept the rest, while the merits of a vote were examined by the counsel; and as an excuse, when challenged by the chairman for such behaviour, bluntly answered, &lsquo;I had made up my mind upon that case.&rsquo; &mdash; Johnson, with an indignant contempt, said, &lsquo;If he was such a rogue as to make up his mind upon a case without hearing it, he should not have been such a fool as to tell it.&rsquo; &lsquo;I think (said Mr. Dudley Long, now North,) the Doctor has pretty plainly made him out to be both rogue and fool.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson&rsquo;s profound reverence for the Hierarchy made him expect from bishops the highest degree of decorum; he was offended even at their going to taverns; &lsquo;A bishop (said he,) has nothing to do at a tippling-house. It is not indeed immoral in him to go to a tavern; neither would it be immoral in him to whip a top in Grosvenor-square. But, if he did, I hope the boys would fall upon him, and apply the whip to HIM. There are gradations in conduct; there is morality, &mdash; decency, &mdash; propriety. None of these should be violated by a bishop. A bishop should not go to a house where he may meet a young fellow leading out a wench.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;But, Sir, every tavern does not admit women.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Depend upon it, Sir, any tavern will admit a well-drest man and a well-drest woman; they will not perhaps admit a woman whom they see every night walking by their door, in the street. But a well-drest man may lead in a well-drest woman to any tavern in London. Taverns sell meat and drink, and will sell them to any body who can eat and can drink. You may as well say that a mercer will not sell silks to a woman of the town.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He also disapproved of bishops going to routs, at least of their staying at them longer than their presence commanded respect. He mentioned a particular bishop. &lsquo;Poh! (said Mrs. Thrale,) the Bishop of &mdash;&mdash;&nbsp; &mdash; is never minded at a rout.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;When a bishop places himself in a situation where he has no distinct character, and is of no consequence, he degrades the dignity of his order.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Mr. Boswell, Madam has said it as correctly as it could be.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson and his friend, Beauclerk, were once together in company with several clergymen, who thought that they should appear to advantage, by assuming the lax jollity of men of the world; which, as it may be observed in similar cases, they carried to noisy excess. Johnson, who they expected would be ENTERTAINED, sat grave and silent for some time; at last, turning to Beauclerk, he said, by no means in a whisper, &lsquo;This merriment of parsons is mighty offensive.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Friday, March 30, I dined with him at Sir Joshua Reynolds&rsquo;s, with the Earl of Charlemont, Sir Annesley Stewart, Mr. Eliot of Port-Eliot, Mr. Burke, Dean Marlay, Mr. Langton; a most agreeable day, of which I regret that every circumstance is not preserved; but it is unreasonable to require such a multiplication of felicity.</p>
<p class="p24">Mr. Eliot mentioned a curious liquor peculiar to his country, which the Cornish fishermen drink. They call it Mahogany; and it is made of two parts gin, and one part treacle, well beaten together. I begged to have some of it made, which was done with proper skill by Mr. Eliot. I thought it very good liquor; and said it was a counterpart of what is called Athol Porridge in the Highlands of Scotland, which is a mixture of whisky and honey. Johnson said, &lsquo;that must be a better liquor than the Cornish, for both its component parts are better.&rsquo; He also observed, &lsquo;Mahogany must be a modern name; for it is not long since the wood called mahogany was known in this country.&rsquo; I mentioned his scale of liquors; &mdash; claret for boys, &mdash; port for men, &mdash; brandy for heroes. &lsquo;Then (said Mr. Burke,) let me have claret: I love to be a boy; to have the careless gaiety of boyish days.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;I should drink claret too, if it would give me that; but it does not: it neither makes boys men, nor men boys. You&rsquo;ll be drowned by it, before it has any effect upon you.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I ventured to mention a ludicrous paragraph in the newspapers, that Dr. Johnson was learning to dance of Vestris. Lord Charlemont, wishing to excite him to talk, proposed in a whisper, that he should be asked, whether it was true. &lsquo;Shall I ask him?&rsquo; said his Lordship. We were, by a great majority, clear for the experiment. Upon which his Lordship very gravely, and with a courteous air said, &lsquo;Pray, Sir, is it true that you are taking lessons of Vestris?&rsquo; This was risking a good deal, and required the boldness of a General of Irish Volunteers to make the attempt. Johnson was at first startled, and in some heat answered, &lsquo;How can your Lordship ask so simple a question?&rsquo; But immediately recovering himself, whether from unwillingness to be deceived, or to appear deceived, or whether from real good humour, he kept up the joke: &lsquo;Nay, but if any body were to answer the paragraph, and contradict it, I&rsquo;d have a reply, and would say, that he who contradicted it was no friend either to Vestris or me. For why should not Dr. Johnson add to his other powers a little corporeal agility? Socrates learnt to dance at an advanced age, and Cato learnt Greek at an advanced age. Then it might proceed to say, that this Johnson, not content with dancing on the ground, might dance on the rope; and they might introduce the elephant dancing on the rope.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Sunday, April 1, I dined with him at Mr. Thrale&rsquo;s, with Sir Philip Jennings Clerk and Mr. Perkins, who had the superintendence of Mr. Thrale&rsquo;s brewery, with a salary of five hundred pounds a year. Sir Philip had the appearance of a gentleman of ancient family, well advanced in life. He wore his own white hair in a bag of goodly size, a black velvet coat, with an embroidered waistcoat, and very rich laced ruffles; which Mrs. Thrale said were old fashioned, but which, for that reason, I thought the more respectable, more like a Tory; yet Sir Philip was then in Opposition in Parliament. &lsquo;Ah, Sir, (said Johnson,) ancient ruffles and modern principles do not agree.&rsquo; Sir Philip defended the Opposition to the American war ably and with temper, and I joined him. He said, the majority of the nation was against the ministry. JOHNSON. &lsquo;I, Sir, am against the ministry; but it is for having too little of that, of which Opposition thinks they have too much. Were I minister, if any man wagged his finger against me, he should be turned out; for that which it is in the power of Government to give at pleasure to one or to another, should be given to the supporters of Government. If you will not oppose at the expence of losing your place, your opposition will not be honest, you will feel no serious grievance; and the present opposition is only a contest to get what others have. Sir Robert Walpole acted as I would do. As to the American war, the SENSE of the nation is WITH the ministry. The majority of those who can UNDERSTAND is with it; the majority of those who can only HEAR, is against it; and as those who can only hear are more numerous than those who can understand, and Opposition is always loudest, a majority of the rabble will be for Opposition.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">This boisterous vivacity entertained us; but the truth in my opinion was, that those who could understand the best were against the American war, as almost every man now is, when the question has been coolly considered.</p>
<p class="p24">Mrs. Thrale gave high praise to Mr. Dudley Long, (now North). JOHNSON. &lsquo;Nay, my dear lady, don&rsquo;t talk so. Mr. Long&rsquo;s character is very SHORT. It is nothing. He fills a chair. He is a man of genteel appearance, and that is all. I know nobody who blasts by praise as you do: for whenever there is exaggerated praise, every body is set against a character. They are provoked to attack it. Now there is Pepys; you praised that man with such disproportion, that I was incited to lessen him, perhaps more than he deserves. His blood is upon your head. By the same principle, your malice defeats itself; for your censure is too violent. And yet, (looking to her with a leering smile,) she is the first woman in the world, could she but restrain that wicked tongue of hers; &mdash; she would be the only woman, could she but command that little whirligig.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Upon the subject of exaggerated praise I took the liberty to say, that I thought there might be very high praise given to a known character which deserved it, and therefore it would not be exaggerated. Thus, one might say of Mr. Edmund Burke, He is a very wonderful man. JOHNSON. &lsquo;No, Sir, you would not be safe if another man had a mind perversely to contradict. He might answer, &ldquo;Where is all the wonder? Burke is, to be sure, a man of uncommon abilities, with a great quantity of matter in his mind, and a great fluency of language in his mouth. But we are not to be stunned and astonished by him.&rdquo; So you see, Sir, even Burke would suffer, not from any fault of his own, but from your folly.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Mrs. Thrale mentioned a gentleman who had acquired a fortune of four thousand a year in trade, but was absolutely miserable, because he could not talk in company; so miserable, that he was impelled to lament his situation in the street to ******, whom he hates, and who he knows despises him. &lsquo;I am a most unhappy man, (said he). I am invited to conversations. I go to conversations; but, alas! I have no conversation.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Man commonly cannot be successful in different ways. This gentleman has spent, in getting four thousand pounds a year, the time in which he might have learnt to talk; and now he cannot talk.&rsquo; Mr. Perkins made a shrewd and droll remark: &lsquo;If he had got his four thousand a year as a mountebank, he might have learnt to talk at the same time that he was getting his fortune.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Some other gentlemen came in. The conversation concerning the person whose character Dr. Johnson had treated so slightingly, as he did not know his merit, was resumed. Mrs. Thrale said, &lsquo;You think so of him, Sir, because he is quiet, and does not exert himself with force. You&rsquo;ll be saying the same thing of Mr. ***** there, who sits as quiet &mdash; .&rsquo; This was not well-bred; and Johnson did not let it pass without correction. &lsquo;Nay, Madam, what right have you to talk thus? Both Mr. ***** and I have reason to take it ill. You may talk so of Mr. *****; but why do you make me do it? Have I said anything against Mr. *****? You have set him, that I might shoot him: but I have not shot him.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">One of the gentlemen said, he had seen three folio volumes of Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s sayings collected by me. &lsquo;I must put you right, Sir, (said I,) for I am very exact in authenticity. You could not see folio volumes, for I have none: you might have seen some in quarto and octavo. This is inattention which one should guard against.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, it is a want of concern about veracity. He does not know that he saw any volumes. If he had seen them he could have remembered their size.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Mr. Thrale appeared very lethargick to-day. I saw him again on Monday evening, at which time he was not thought to be in immediate danger; but early in the morning of Wednesday, the 4th, he expired. Johnson was in the house, and thus mentions the event: &lsquo;I felt almost the last flutter of his pulse, and looked for the last time upon the face that for fifteen years had never been turned upon me but with respect and benignity.&rsquo; Upon that day there was a Call of The LITERARY CLUB; but Johnson apologised for his absence by the following note: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;MR. JOHNSON knows that Sir Joshua Reynolds and the other gentlemen will excuse his incompliance with the call, when they are told that Mr. Thrale died this morning. &mdash; Wednesday.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Mr. Thrale&rsquo;s death was a very essential loss to Johnson, who, although he did not foresee all that afterwards happened, was sufficiently convinced that the comforts which Mr. Thrale&rsquo;s family afforded him, would now in a great measure cease. He, however, continued to shew a kind attention to his widow and children as long as it was acceptable; and he took upon him, with a very earnest concern, the office of one of his executors, the importance of which seemed greater than usual to him, from his circumstances having been always such, that he had scarcely any share in the real business of life. His friends of THE CLUB were in hopes that Mr. Thrale might have made a liberal provision for him for his life, which, as Mr. Thrale left no son, and a very large fortune, it would have been highly to his honour to have done; and, considering Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s age, could not have been of long duration; but he bequeathed him only two hundred pounds, which was the legacy given to each of his executors. I could not but be somewhat diverted by hearing Johnson talk in a pompous manner of his new office, and particularly of the concerns of the brewery, which it was at last resolved should be sold. Lord Lucan tells a very good story, which, if not precisely exact, is certainly characteristical: that when the sale of Thrale&rsquo;s brewery was going forward, Johnson appeared bustling about, with an ink-horn and pen in his button-hole, like an excise-man; and on being asked what he really considered to be the value of the property which was to be disposed of, answered, &lsquo;We are not here to sell a parcel of boilers and vats, but the potentiality of growing rich, beyond the dreams of avarice.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Friday, April 6, he carried me to dine at a club, which, at his desire, had been lately formed at the Queen&rsquo;s Arms, in St. Paul&rsquo;s Church-yard. He told Mr. Hoole, that he wished to have a City Club, and asked him to collect one; but, said he, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t let them be PATRIOTS.&rsquo; The company were to-day very sensible, well-behaved men.</p>
<p class="p24">On Friday, April 13, being Good-Friday, I went to St. Clement&rsquo;s church with him as usual. There I saw again his old fellow-collegian, Edwards, to whom I said, &lsquo;I think, Sir, Dr. Johnson and you meet only at Church.&rsquo;&mdash; &lsquo;Sir, (said he,) it is the best place we can meet in, except Heaven, and I hope we shall meet there too.&rsquo; Dr. Johnson told me, that there was very little communication between Edwards and him, after their unexpected renewal of acquaintance. &lsquo;But, (said he, smiling), he met me once, and said, &ldquo;I am told you have written a very pretty book called The Rambler.&rdquo; I was unwilling that he should leave the world in total darkness, and sent him a set.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Mr. Berrenger visited him to-day, and was very pleasing. We talked of an evening society for conversation at a house in town, of which we were all members, but of which Johnson said, &lsquo;It will never do, Sir. There is nothing served about there, neither tea, nor coffee, nor lemonade, nor any thing whatever; and depend upon it, Sir, a man does not love to go to a place from whence he comes out exactly as he went in.&rsquo; I endeavoured, for argument&rsquo;s sake, to maintain that men of learning and talents might have very good intellectual society, without the aid of any little gratifications of the senses. Berrenger joined with Johnson, and said, that without these any meeting would be dull and insipid. He would therefore have all the slight refreshments; nay, it would not be amiss to have some cold meat, and a bottle of wine upon a side-board. &lsquo;Sir, (said Johnson to me, with an air of triumph,) Mr. Berrenger knows the world. Every body loves to have good things furnished to them without any trouble. I told Mrs. Thrale once, that as she did not choose to have card tables, she should have a profusion of the best sweetmeats, and she would be sure to have company enough come to her.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Sunday, April 15, being Easter-day, after solemn worship in St. Paul&rsquo;s church, I found him alone; Dr. Scott of the Commons came in.</p>
<p class="p24">We talked of the difference between the mode of education at Oxford, and that in those Colleges where instruction is chiefly conveyed by lectures. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Lectures were once useful; but now, when all can read, and books are so numerous, lectures are unnecessary. If your attention fails, and you miss a part of a lecture, it is lost; you cannot go back as you do upon a book.&rsquo; Dr. Scott agreed with him. &lsquo;But yet (said I), Dr. Scott, you yourself gave lectures at Oxford.&rsquo; He smiled. &lsquo;You laughed (then said I,) at those who came to you.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Dr. Scott left us, and soon afterwards we went to dinner. Our company consisted of Mrs. Williams, Mrs. Desmoulins, Mr. Levett, Mr. Allen, the printer, and Mrs. Hall, sister of the Reverend Mr. John Wesley, and resembling him, as I thought, both in figure and manner. Johnson produced now, for the first time, some handsome silver salvers, which he told me he had bought fourteen years ago; so it was a great day. I was not a little amused by observing Allen perpetually struggling to talk in the manner of Johnson, like the little frog in the fable blowing himself up to resemble the stately ox.</p>
<p class="p24">He mentioned a thing as not unfrequent, of which I had never heard before, &mdash; being CALLED, that is, hearing one&rsquo;s name pronounced by the voice of a known person at a great distance, far beyond the possibility of being reached by any sound uttered by human organs. &lsquo;An acquaintance, on whose veracity I can depend, told me, that walking home one evening to Kilmarnock, he heard himself called from a wood, by the voice of a brother who had gone to America; and the next packet brought accounts of that brother&rsquo;s death.&rsquo; Macbean asserted that this inexplicable CALLING was a thing very well known. Dr. Johnson said, that one day at Oxford, as he was turning the key of his chamber, he heard his mother distinctly call SAM. She was then at Lichfleld; but nothing ensued. This phaenomenon is, I think, as wonderful as any other mysterious fact, which many people are very slow to believe, or rather, indeed, reject with an obstinate contempt.</p>
<p class="p24">Some time after this, upon his making a remark which escaped my attention, Mrs. Williams and Mrs. Hall were both together striving to answer him. He grew angry, and called out loudly, &lsquo;Nay, when you both speak at once, it is intolerable.&rsquo; But checking himself, and softening, he said, &lsquo;This one may say, though you ARE ladies.&rsquo; Then he brightened into gay humour, and addressed them in the words of one of the songs in The Beggar&rsquo;s Opera: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;But two at a time there&rsquo;s no mortal can bear.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;What, Sir, (said I,) are you going to turn Captain Macheath?&rsquo; There was something as pleasantly ludicrous in this scene as can be imagined. The contrast between Macheath, Polly, and Lucy &mdash; and Dr. Samuel Johnson, blind, peevish Mrs. Williams, and lean, lank, preaching Mrs. Hall, was exquisite.</p>
<p class="p24">On Friday, April 20, I spent with him one of the happiest days that I remember to have enjoyed in the whole course of my life. Mrs. Garrick, whose grief for the loss of her husband was, I believe, as sincere as wounded affection and admiration could produce, had this day, for the first time since his death, a select party of his friends to dine with her. The company was Miss Hannah More, who lived with her, and whom she called her Chaplain; Mrs. Boscawen, Mrs. Elizabeth Carter, Sir Joshua Reynolds, Dr. Burney, Dr. Johnson, and myself. We found ourselves very elegantly entertained at her house in the Adelphi, where I have passed many a pleasing hour with him &lsquo;who gladdened life.&rsquo; She looked well, talked of her husband with complacency, and while she cast her eyes on his portrait, which hung over the chimney-piece, said, that &lsquo;death was now the most agreeable object to her.&rsquo; The very semblance of David Garrick was cheering.</p>
<p class="p24">We were all in fine spirits; and I whispered to Mrs. Boscawen, &lsquo;I believe this is as much as can be made of life.&rsquo; In addition to a splendid entertainment, we were regaled with Lichfield ale, which had a peculiar appropriated value. Sir Joshua, and Dr. Burney, and I, drank cordially of it to Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s health; and though he would not join us, he as cordially answered, &lsquo;Gentlemen, I wish you all as well as you do me.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">The general effect of this day dwells upon my mind in fond remembrance; but I do not find much conversation recorded. What I have preserved shall be faithfully given.</p>
<p class="p24">One of the company mentioned Mr. Thomas Hollis, the strenuous Whig, who used to send over Europe presents of democratical books, with their boards stamped with daggers and caps of liberty. Mrs. Carter said, &lsquo;He was a bad man. He used to talk uncharitably.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Poh! poh! Madam; who is the worse for being talked of uncharitably? Besides, he was a dull poor creature as ever lived: and I believe he would not have done harm to a man whom he knew to be of very opposite principles to his own. I remember once at the Society of Arts, when an advertisement was to be drawn up, he pointed me out as the man who could do it best. This, you will observe, was kindness to me. I however slipt away, and escaped it.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Mrs. Carter having said of the same person, &lsquo;I doubt he was an Atheist.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know that. He might perhaps have become one, if he had had time to ripen, (smiling.) He might have EXUBERATED into an Atheist.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Sir Joshua Reynolds praised Mudge&rsquo;s Sermons. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Mudge&rsquo;s Sermons are good, but not practical. He grasps more sense than he can hold; he takes more corn than he can make into meal; he opens a wide prospect, but it is so distant, it is indistinct. I love Blair&rsquo;s Sermons. Though the dog is a Scotchman, and a Presbyterian, and every thing he should not be, I was the first to praise them. Such was my candour,&rsquo; (smiling.) MRS. BOSCAWEN. &lsquo;Such his great merit to get the better of all your prejudices.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Madam, let us compound the matter; let us ascribe it to my candour, and his merit.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">In the evening we had a large company in the drawing-room, several ladies, the Bishop of Killaloe, Dr. Percy, Mr. Chamberlayne, of the Treasury, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
<p class="p24">Talking of a very respectable authour, he told us a curious circumstance in his life, which was, that he had married a printer&rsquo;s devil. REYNOLDS. &lsquo;A printer&rsquo;s devil, Sir! Why, I thought a printer&rsquo;s devil was a creature with a black face and in rags.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Yes, Sir. But I suppose, he had her face washed, and put clean clothes on her. (Then looking very serious, and very earnest.) And she did not disgrace him; the woman had a bottom of good sense.&rsquo; The word bottom thus introduced, was so ludicrous when contrasted with his gravity, that most of us could not forbear tittering and laughing; though I recollect that the Bishop of Killaloe kept his countenance with perfect steadiness, while Miss Hannah More slyly hid her face behind a lady&rsquo;s back who sat on the same settee with her. His pride could not bear that any expression of his should excite ridicule, when he did not intend it; he therefore resolved to assume and exercise despotick power, glanced sternly around, and called out in a strong tone, &lsquo;Where&rsquo;s the merriment?&rsquo; Then collecting himself, and looking aweful, to make us feel how he could impose restraint, and as it were searching his mind for a still more ludicrous word, he slowly pronounced, &lsquo;I say the WOMAN was FUNDAMENTALLY sensible;&rsquo; as if he had said, hear this now, and laugh if you dare. We all sat composed as at a funeral.</p>
<p class="p24">He and I walked away together; we stopped a little while by the rails of the Adelphi, looking on the Thames, and I said to him with some emotion that I was now thinking of two friends we had lost, who once lived in the buildings behind us, Beauclerk and Garrick. &lsquo;Ay, Sir, (said he, tenderly,) and two such friends as cannot be supplied.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">For some time after this day I did not see him very often, and of the conversation which I did enjoy, I am sorry to find I have preserved but little. I was at this time engaged in a variety of other matters, which required exertion and assiduity, and necessarily occupied almost all my time.</p>
<p class="p24">On Tuesday, May 8, I had the pleasure of again dining with him and Mr. Wilkes, at Mr. Dilly&rsquo;s. No NEGOCIATION was now required to bring them together; for Johnson was so well satisfied with the former interview, that he was very glad to meet Wilkes again, who was this day seated between Dr. Beattie and Dr. Johnson; (between Truth and Reason, as General Paoli said, when I told him of it.) WILKES. &lsquo;I have been thinking, Dr. Johnson, that there should be a bill brought into parliament that the controverted elections for Scotland should be tried in that country, at their own Abbey of Holy-Rood House, and not here; for the consequence of trying them here is, that we have an inundation of Scotchmen, who come up and never go back again. Now here is Boswell, who is come up upon the election for his own county, which will not last a fortnight.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Nay, Sir, I see no reason why they should be tried at all; for, you know, one Scotchman is as good as another.&rsquo; WILKES. &lsquo;Pray, Boswell, how much may be got in a year by an Advocate at the Scotch bar?&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;I believe two thousand pounds.&rsquo; WILKES. &lsquo;How can it be possible to spend that money in Scotland?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, the money may be spent in England: but there is a harder question. If one man in Scotland gets possession of two thousand pounds, what remains for all the rest of the nation?&rsquo; WILKES. &lsquo;You know, in the last war, the immense booty which Thurot carried off by the complete plunder of seven Scotch isles; he re-embarked with THREE AND SIX-PENCE.&rsquo; Here again Johnson and Wilkes joined in extravagant sportive raillery upon the supposed poverty of Scotland, which Dr. Beattie and I did not think it worth our while to dispute.</p>
<p class="p24">The subject of quotation being introduced, Mr. Wilkes censured it as pedantry. JOHNSON. &lsquo;No, Sir, it is a good thing; there is a community of mind in it. Classical quotation is the parole of literary men all over the world.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He gave us an entertaining account of Bet Flint, a woman of the town, who, with some eccentrick talents and much effrontery, forced herself upon his acquaintance. &lsquo;Bet (said he,) wrote her own Life in verse, which she brought to me, wishing that I would furnish her with a Preface to it, (laughing.) I used to say of her that she was generally slut and drunkard; occasionally, whore and thief. She had, however, genteel lodgings, a spinnet on which she played, and a boy that walked before her chair. Poor Bet was taken up on a charge of stealing a counterpane, and tried at the Old Bailey. Chief Justice &mdash;&mdash;&nbsp; &mdash; , who loved a wench, summed up favourably, and she was acquitted. After which Bet said, with a gay and satisfied air, &ldquo;Now that the counterpane is MY OWN, I shall make a petticoat of it.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Talking of oratory, Mr. Wilkes described it as accompanied with all the charms of poetical expression. JOHNSON. &lsquo;No, Sir; oratory is the power of beating down your adversary&rsquo;s arguments, and putting better in their place.&rsquo; WILKES. &lsquo;But this does not move the passions.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;He must be a weak man, who is to be so moved.&rsquo; WILKES. (naming a celebrated orator,) &lsquo;Amidst all the brilliancy of &mdash;&mdash; &mdash; &lsquo;s imagination, and the exuberance of his wit, there is a strange want of TASTE. It was observed of Apelles&rsquo;s Venus, that her flesh seemed as if she had been nourished by roses: his oratory would sometimes make one suspect that he eats potatoes and drinks whisky.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Mr. Wilkes said to me, loud enough for Dr. Johnson to hear, &lsquo;Dr. Johnson should make me a present of his Lives of the Poets, as I am a poor patriot, who cannot afford to buy them.&rsquo; Johnson seemed to take no notice of this hint; but in a little while, he called to Mr. Dilly, &lsquo;Pray, Sir, be so good as to send a set of my Lives to Mr. Wilkes, with my compliments.&rsquo; This was accordingly done; and Mr. Wilkes paid Dr. Johnson a visit, was courteously received, and sat with him a long time.</p>
<p class="p24">The company gradually dropped away. Mr. Dilly himself was called down stairs upon business; I left the room for some time; when I returned, I was struck with observing Dr. Samuel Johnson and John Wilkes, Esq., literally tete-a-tete; for they were reclined upon their chairs, with their heads leaning almost close to each other, and talking earnestly, in a kind of confidential whisper, of the personal quarrel between George the Second and the King of Prussia. Such a scene of perfectly easy sociality between two such opponents in the war of political controversy, as that which I now beheld, would have been an excellent subject for a picture. It presented to my mind the happy days which are foretold in Scripture, when the lion shall lie down with the kid.</p>
<p class="p24">After this day there was another pretty long interval, during which Dr. Johnson and I did not meet. When I mentioned it to him with regret, he was pleased to say, &lsquo;Then, Sir, let us live double.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">About this time it was much the fashion for several ladies to have evening assemblies, where the fair sex might participate in conversation with literary and ingenious men, animated by a desire to please. These societies were denominated Blue-stocking Clubs, the origin of which title being little known, it may be worth while to relate it. One of the most eminent members of those societies, when they first commenced, was Mr. Stillingfleet, whose dress was remarkably grave, and in particular it was observed, that he wore blue stockings. Such was the excellence of his conversation, that his absence was felt as so great a loss, that it used to be said, &lsquo;We can do nothing without the blue stockings;&rsquo; and thus by degrees the title was established. Miss Hannah More has admirably described a Blue-stocking Club, in her Bas Bleu, a poem in which many of the persons who were most conspicuous there are mentioned.</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson was prevailed with to come sometimes into these circles, and did not think himself too grave even for the lively Miss Monckton (now Countess of Corke), who used to have the finest BIT OF BLUE at the house of her mother, Lady Galway. Her vivacity enchanted the Sage, and they used to talk together with all imaginable ease. A singular instance happened one evening, when she insisted that some of Sterne&rsquo;s writings were very pathetick. Johnson bluntly denied it. &lsquo;I am sure (said she,) they have affected ME.&rsquo; &lsquo;Why, (said Johnson, smiling, and rolling himself about,) that is, because, dearest, you&rsquo;re a dunce.&rsquo; When she some time afterwards mentioned this to him, he said with equal truth and politeness; &lsquo;Madam, if I had thought so, I certainly should not have said it.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Another evening Johnson&rsquo;s kind indulgence towards me had a pretty difficult trial. I had dined at the Duke of Montrose&rsquo;s with a very agreeable party, and his Grace, according to his usual custom, had circulated the bottle very freely. Lord Graham and I went together to Miss Monckton&rsquo;s, where I certainly was in extraordinary spirits, and above all fear or awe. In the midst of a great number of persons of the first rank, amongst whom I recollect with confusion, a noble lady of the most stately decorum, I placed myself next to Johnson, and thinking myself now fully his match, talked to him in a loud and boisterous manner, desirous to let the company know how I could contend with Ajax. I particularly remember pressing him upon the value of the pleasures of the imagination, and as an illustration of my argument, asking him, &lsquo;What, Sir, supposing I were to fancy that the &mdash;&mdash; (naming the most charming Duchess in his Majesty&rsquo;s dominions) were in love with me, should I not be very happy?&rsquo; My friend with much address evaded my interrogatories, and kept me as quiet as possible; but it may easily be conceived how he must have felt. However, when a few days afterwards I waited upon him and made an apology, he behaved with the most friendly gentleness.</p>
<p class="p24">While I remained in London this year, Johnson and I dined together at several places. I recollect a placid day at Dr. Butter&rsquo;s, who had now removed from Derby to Lower Grosvenor-street, London; but of his conversation on that and other occasions during this period, I neglected to keep any regular record, and shall therefore insert here some miscellaneous articles which I find in my Johnsonian notes.</p>
<p class="p24">His disorderly habits, when &lsquo;making provision for the day that was passing over him,&rsquo; appear from the following anecdote, communicated to me by Mr. John Nichols:&mdash; &lsquo;In the year 1763, a young bookseller, who was an apprentice to Mr. Whiston, waited on him with a subscription to his Shakspeare: and observing that the Doctor made no entry in any book of the subscriber&rsquo;s name, ventured diffidently to ask, whether he would please to have the gentleman&rsquo;s address, that it might be properly inserted in the printed list of subscribers. &ldquo;I shall print no list of subscribers;&rdquo; said Johnson, with great abruptness: but almost immediately recollecting himself, added, very complacently, &ldquo;Sir, I have two very cogent reasons for not printing any list of subscribers; &mdash; one, that I have lost all the names, &mdash; the other, that I have spent all the money.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson could not brook appearing to be worsted in argument, even when he had taken the wrong side, to shew the force and dexterity of his talents. When, therefore, he perceived that his opponent gained ground, he had recourse to some sudden mode of robust sophistry. Once when I was pressing upon him with visible advantage, he stopped me thus:&mdash; &lsquo;My dear Boswell, let&rsquo;s have no more of this; you&rsquo;ll make nothing of it. I&rsquo;d rather have you whistle a Scotch tune.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Care, however, must be taken to distinguish between Johnson when he &lsquo;talked for victory,&rsquo; and Johnson when he had no desire but to inform and illustrate. &lsquo;One of Johnson s principal talents (says an eminent friend of his) was shewn in maintaining the wrong side of an argument, and in a splendid perversion of the truth. If you could contrive to have his fair opinion on a subject, and without any bias from personal prejudice, or from a wish to be victorious in argument, it was wisdom itself, not only convincing, but overpowering.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He had, however, all his life habituated himself to consider conversation as a trial of intellectual vigour and skill; and to this, I think, we may venture to ascribe that unexampled richness and brilliancy which appeared in his own. As a proof at once of his eagerness for colloquial distinction, and his high notion of this eminent friend, he once addressed him thus:&mdash; &lsquo; &mdash;&mdash; , we now have been several hours together; and you have said but one thing for which I envied you.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Goldsmith could sometimes take adventurous liberties with him, and escape unpunished. Beauclerk told me that when Goldsmith talked of a project for having a third Theatre in London, solely for the exhibition of new plays, in order to deliver authours from the supposed tyranny of managers, Johnson treated it slightingly; upon which Goldsmith said, &lsquo;Ay, ay, this may be nothing to you, who can now shelter yourself behind the corner of a pension;&rsquo; and that Johnson bore this with good-humour.</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson had called twice on the Bishop of Killaloe before his Lordship set out for Ireland, having missed him the first time. He said, &lsquo;It would have hung heavy on my heart if I had not seen him. No man ever paid more attention to another than he has done to me; and I have neglected him, not wilfully, but from being otherwise occupied. Always, Sir, set a high value on spontaneous kindness. He whose inclination prompts him to cultivate your friendship of his own accord, will love you more than one whom you have been at pains to attach to you.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I asked him if he was not dissatisfied with having so small a share of wealth, and none of those distinctions in the state which are the objects of ambition. He had only a pension of three hundred a year. Why was he not in such circumstances as to keep his coach? Why had he not some considerable office? JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, I have never complained of the world; nor do I think that I have reason to complain. It is rather to be wondered at that I have so much. My pension is more out of the usual course of things than any instance that I have known. Here, Sir, was a man avowedly no friend to Government at the time, who got a pension without asking for it. I never courted the great; they sent for me; but I think they now give me up. They are satisfied; they have seen enough of me.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Strange, however, it is, to consider how few of the great sought his society; so that if one were disposed to take occasion for satire on that account, very conspicuous objects present themselves. His noble friend, Lord Elibank, well observed, that if a great man procured an interview with Johnson, and did not wish to see him more, it shewed a mere idle curiosity, and a wretched want of relish for extraordinary powers of mind. Mrs. Thrale justly and wittily accounted for such conduct by saying, that Johnson&rsquo;s conversation was by much too strong for a person accustomed to obsequiousness and flattery; it was mustard in a young child&rsquo;s mouth!</p>
<p class="p24">On Saturday, June 2, I set out for Scotland, and had promised to pay a visit in my way, as I sometimes did, at Southill, in Bedfordshire, at the hospitable mansion of &lsquo;Squire Dilly, the elder brother of my worthy friends, the booksellers, in the Poultry. Dr. Johnson agreed to be of the party this year, with Mr. Charles Dilly and me, and to go and see Lord Bute&rsquo;s seat at Luton Hoe. He talked little to us in the carriage, being chiefly occupied in reading Dr. Watson&rsquo;s second volume of Chemical Essays, which he liked very well, and his own Prince of Abyssinia, on which he seemed to be intensely fixed; having told us, that he had not looked at it since it was first published. I happened to take it out of my pocket this day, and he seized upon it with avidity.</p>
<p class="p24">We stopped at Welwyn, where I wished much to see, in company with Dr. Johnson, the residence of the authour of Night Thoughts, which was then possessed by his son, Mr. Young. Here some address was requisite, for I was not acquainted with Mr. Young, and had I proposed to Dr. Johnson that we should send to him, he would have checked my wish, and perhaps been offended. I therefore concerted with Mr. Dilly, that I should steal away from Dr. Johnson and him, and try what reception I could procure from Mr. Young; if unfavourable, nothing was to be said; but if agreeable, I should return and notify it to them. I hastened to Mr. Young&rsquo;s, found he was at home, sent in word that a gentleman desired to wait upon him, and was shewn into a parlour, where he and a young lady, his daughter, were sitting. He appeared to be a plain, civil, country gentleman; and when I begged pardon for presuming to trouble him, but that I wished much to see his place, if he would give me leave; he behaved very courteously, and answered, &lsquo;By all means, Sir; we are just going to drink tea; will you sit down?&rsquo; I thanked him, but said, that Dr. Johnson had come with me from London, and I must return to the inn and drink tea with him; that my name was Boswell, I had travelled with him in the Hebrides. &lsquo;Sir, (said he,) I should think it a great honour to see Dr. Johnson here. Will you allow me to send for him?&rsquo; Availing myself of this opening, I said that &lsquo;I would go myself and bring him, when he had drunk tea; he knew nothing of my calling here.&rsquo; Having been thus successful, I hastened back to the inn, and informed Dr. Johnson that &lsquo;Mr. Young, son of Dr. Young, the authour of Night Thoughts, whom I had just left, desired to have the honour of seeing him at the house where his father lived.&rsquo; Dr. Johnson luckily made no inquiry how this invitation had arisen, but agreed to go, and when we entered Mr. Young&rsquo;s parlour, he addressed him with a very polite bow, &lsquo;Sir, I had a curiosity to come and see this place. I had the honour to know that great man, your father.&rsquo; We went into the garden, where we found a gravel walk, on each side of which was a row of trees, planted by Dr. Young, which formed a handsome Gothick arch; Dr. Johnson called it a fine grove. I beheld it with reverence.</p>
<p class="p24">We sat some time in the summer-house, on the outside wall of which was inscribed, &lsquo;Ambulantes in horto audiebant vocem Dei;&rsquo; and in reference to a brook by which it is situated, &lsquo;Vivendi recte qui prorogat horam,&rsquo; &amp;c. I said to Mr. Young, that I had been told his father was cheerful. &lsquo;Sir, (said he,) he was too well-bred a man not to be cheerful in company; but he was gloomy when alone. He never was cheerful after my mother&rsquo;s death, and he had met with many disappointments.&rsquo; Dr. Johnson observed to me afterwards, &lsquo;That this was no favourable account of Dr. Young; for it is not becoming in a man to have so little acquiescence in the ways of Providence, as to be gloomy because he has not obtained as much preferment as he expected; nor to continue gloomy for the loss of his wife. Grief has its time.&rsquo; The last part of this censure was theoretically made. Practically, we know that grief for the loss of a wife may be continued very long, in proportion as affection has been sincere. No man knew this better than Dr. Johnson.</p>
<p class="p24">Upon the road we talked of the uncertainty of profit with which authours and booksellers engage in the publication of literary works. JOHNSON. &lsquo;My judgement I have found is no certain rule as to the sale of a book.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Pray, Sir, have you been much plagued with authours sending you their works to revise?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;No, Sir; I have been thought a sour, surly fellow.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Very lucky for you, Sir, &mdash; in that respect.&rsquo; I must however observe, that notwithstanding what he now said, which he no doubt imagined at the time to be the fact, there was, perhaps, no man who more frequently yielded to the solicitations even of very obscure authours, to read their manuscripts, or more liberally assisted them with advice and correction.</p>
<p class="p24">He found himself very happy at &lsquo;Squire Dilly&rsquo;s, where there is always abundance of excellent fare, and hearty welcome.</p>
<p class="p24">On Sunday, June 3, we all went to Southill church, which is very near to Mr. Dilly&rsquo;s house. It being the first Sunday of the month, the holy sacrament was administered, and I staid to partake of it. When I came afterwards into Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s room, he said, &lsquo;You did right to stay and receive the communion; I had not thought of it.&rsquo; This seemed to imply that he did not choose to approach the altar without a previous preparation, as to which good men entertain different opinions, some holding that it is irreverent to partake of that ordinance without considerable premeditation.</p>
<p class="p24">Although upon most occasions I never heard a more strenuous advocate for the advantages of wealth, than Dr. Johnson: he this day, I know not from what caprice, took the other side. &lsquo;I have not observed (said he,) that men of very large fortunes enjoy any thing extraordinary that makes happiness. What has the Duke of Bedford? What has the Duke of Devonshire? The only great instance that I have ever known of the enjoyment of wealth was, that of Jamaica Dawkins, who, going to visit Palmyra, and hearing that the way was infested by robbers, hired a troop of Turkish horse to guard him.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Dr. Gibbons, the Dissenting minister, being mentioned, he said, &lsquo;I took to Dr. Gibbons.&rsquo; And addressing himself to Mr. Charles Dilly, added, &lsquo;I shall be glad to see him. Tell him, if he&rsquo;ll call on me, and dawdle over a dish of tea in an afternoon, I shall take it kind.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">The Reverend Mr. Smith, Vicar of Southill, a very respectable man, with a very agreeable family, sent an invitation to us to drink tea. I remarked Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s very respectful politeness. Though always fond of changing the scene, he said, &lsquo;We must have Mr. Dilly&rsquo;s leave. We cannot go from your house, Sir, without your permission.&rsquo; We all went, and were well satisfied with our visit.</p>
<p class="p24">When I observed that a housebreaker was in general very timorous; JOHNSON. &lsquo;No wonder, Sir; he is afraid of being shot getting INTO a house, or hanged when he has got OUT of it.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He told us, that he had in one day written six sheets of a translation from the French, adding, &lsquo;I should be glad to see it now. I wish that I had copies of all the pamphlets written against me, as it is said Pope had. Had I known that I should make so much noise in the world, I should have been at pains to collect them. I believe there is hardly a day in which there is not something about me in the newspapers.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Monday, June 4, we all went to Luton-Hoe, to see Lord Bute&rsquo;s magnificent seat, for which I had obtained a ticket. As we entered the park, I talked in a high style of my old friendship with Lord Mountstuart, and said, &lsquo;I shall probably be much at this place.&rsquo; The Sage, aware of human vicissitudes, gently checked me: &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you be too sure of that.&rsquo; He made two or three peculiar observations; as when shewn the botanical garden, &lsquo;Is not EVERY garden a botanical garden?&rsquo; When told that there was a shrubbery to the extent of several miles: &lsquo;That is making a very foolish use of the ground; a little of it is very well.&rsquo; When it was proposed that we should walk on the pleasure-ground; &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t let us fatigue ourselves. Why should we walk there? Here&rsquo;s a fine tree, let&rsquo;s get to the top of it.&rsquo; But upon the whole, he was very much pleased. He said, &lsquo;This is one of the places I do not regret having come to see. It is a very stately place, indeed; in the house magnificence is not sacrificed to convenience, nor convenience to magnificence. The library is very splendid: the dignity of the rooms is very great; and the quantity of pictures is beyond expectation, beyond hope.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">It happened without any previous concert, that we visited the seat of Lord Bute upon the King&rsquo;s birthday; we dined and drank his Majesty&rsquo;s health at an inn, in the village of Luton.</p>
<p class="p24">In the evening I put him in mind of his promise to favour me with a copy of his celebrated Letter to the Earl of Chesterfield, and he was at last pleased to comply with this earnest request, by dictating it to me from his memory; for he believed that he himself had no copy. There was an animated glow in his countenance while he thus recalled his high-minded indignation.</p>
<p class="p24">On Tuesday, June 5, Johnson was to return to London. He was very pleasant at breakfast; I mentioned a friend of mine having resolved never to marry a pretty woman. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir it is a very foolish resolution to resolve not to marry a pretty woman. Beauty is of itself very estimable. No, Sir, I would prefer a pretty woman, unless there are objections to her. A pretty woman may be foolish; a pretty woman may be wicked; a pretty woman may not like me. But there is no such danger in marrying a pretty woman as is apprehended: she will not be persecuted if she does not invite persecution. A pretty woman, if she has a mind to be wicked, can find a readier way than another; and that is all.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">At Shefford I had another affectionate parting from my revered friend, who was taken up by the Bedford coach and carried to the metropolis. I went with Messieurs Dilly, to see some friends at Bedford; dined with the officers of the militia of the county, and next day proceeded on my journey.</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson&rsquo;s charity to the poor was uniform and extensive, both from inclination and principle. He not only bestowed liberally out of his own purse, but what is more difficult as well as rare, would beg from others, when he had proper objects in view. This he did judiciously as well as humanely. Mr. Philip Metcalfe tells me, that when he has asked him for some money for persons in distress, and Mr. Metcalfe has offered what Johnson thought too much, he insisted on taking less, saying, &lsquo;No, no, Sir; we must not PAMPER them.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I am indebted to Mr. Malone, one of Sir Joshua Reynolds&rsquo;s executors, for the following note, which was found among his papers after his death, and which, we may presume, his unaffected modesty prevented him from communicating to me with the other letters from Dr. Johnson with which he was pleased to furnish me. However slight in itself, as it does honour to that illustrious painter, and most amiable man, I am happy to introduce it.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;TO SIR JOSHUA REYNOLDS.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;DEAR SIR, &mdash; It was not before yesterday that I received your splendid benefaction. To a hand so liberal in distributing, I hope nobody will envy the power of acquiring. I am, dear Sir, your obliged and most humble servant,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;June 23, 1781.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">The following curious anecdote I insert in Dr. Burney&rsquo;s own words: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Dr. Burney related to Dr. Johnson the partiality which his writings had excited in a friend of Dr. Burney&rsquo;s, the late Mr. Bewley, well known in Norfolk by the name of the Philosopher of Massingham: who, from the Ramblers and Plan of his Dictionary, and long before the authour&rsquo;s fame was established by the Dictionary itself, or any other work, had conceived such a reverence for him, that he urgently begged Dr. Burney to give him the cover of the first letter he had received from him, as a relick of so estimable a writer. This was in 1755. In 1760, when Dr. Burney visited Dr. Johnson at the Temple in London, where he had then chambers, he happened to arrive there before he was up; and being shewn into the room where he was to breakfast, finding himself alone, he examined the contents of the apartment, to try whether he could undiscovered steal anything to send to his friend Bewley, as another relick of the admirable Dr. Johnson. But finding nothing better to his purpose, he cut some bristles off his hearth-broom, and enclosed them in a letter to his country enthusiast, who received them with due reverence. The Doctor was so sensible of the honour done him by a man of genius and science, to whom he was an utter stranger, that he said to Dr. Burney, &ldquo;Sir, there is no man possessed of the smallest portion of modesty, but must be flattered with the admiration of such a man. I&rsquo;ll give him a set of my Lives, if he will do me the honour to accept of them.&rdquo; In this he kept his word; and Dr. Burney had not only the pleasure of gratifying his friend with a present more worthy of his acceptance than the segment from the hearth-broom, but soon after of introducing him to Dr. Johnson himself in Bolt-court, with whom he had the satisfaction of conversing a considerable time, not a fortnight before his death; which happened in St. Martin&rsquo;s-street, during his visit to Dr. Burney, in the house where the great Sir Isaac Newton had lived and died before.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">In one of his little memorandum-books is the following minute: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;August 9, 3 P.M., aetat. 72, in the summer-house at Streatham.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;After innumerable resolutions formed and neglected, I have retired hither, to plan a life of greater diligence, in hope that I may yet be useful, and be daily better prepared to appear before my Creator and my Judge, from whose infinite mercy I humbly call for assistance and support.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;My purpose is,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To pass eight hours every day in some serious employment.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Having prayed, I purpose to employ the next six weeks upon the Italian language, for my settled study.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">In autumn he went to Oxford, Birmingham, Lichfield, and Ashbourne, for which very good reasons might be given in the conjectural yet positive manner of writers, who are proud to account for every event which they relate. He himself, however, says, &lsquo;The motives of my journey I hardly know; I omitted it last year, and am not willing to miss it again.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">But some good considerations arise, amongst which is the kindly recollection of Mr. Hector, surgeon at Birmingham: &lsquo;Hector is likewise an old friend, the only companion of my childhood that passed through the school with me. We have always loved one another; perhaps we may be made better by some serious conversation, of which however I have no distinct hope.&rsquo; He says too, &lsquo;At Lichfield, my native place, I hope to shew a good example by frequent attendance on publick worship.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">1782: AETAT. 73.] &mdash; In 1782, his complaints increased, and the history of his life this year, is little more than a mournful recital of the variations of his illness, in the midst of which, however, it will appear from his letters, that the powers of his mind were in no degree impaired.</p>
<p class="p24">At a time when he was less able than he had once been to sustain a shock, he was suddenly deprived of Mr. Levett, which event he thus communicated to Dr. Lawrence: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;SIR, &mdash; Our old friend, Mr. Levett, who was last night eminently cheerful, died this morning. The man who lay in the same room, hearing an uncommon noise, got up and tried to make him speak, but without effect, he then called Mr. Holder, the apothecary, who, though when he came he thought him dead, opened a vein, but could draw no blood. So has ended the long life of a very useful and very blameless man. I am, Sir, your most humble servant,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Jan. 17, 1782.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">In one of his memorandum-books in my possession, is the following entry:&mdash; &lsquo;January 20, Sunday. Robert Levett was buried in the church-yard of Bridewell, between one and two in the afternoon. He died on Thursday 17, about seven in the morning, by an instantaneous death. He was an old and faithful friend; I have known him from about 46. Commendavi. May GOD have mercy on him. May he have mercy on me.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On the 30th of August, I informed him that my honoured father had died that morning; a complaint under which he had long laboured having suddenly come to a crisis, while I was upon a visit at the seat of Sir Charles Preston, from whence I had hastened the day before, upon receiving a letter by express.</p>
<p class="p24">In answer to my next letter, I received one from him, dissuading me from hastening to him as I had proposed; what is proper for publication is the following paragraph, equally just and tender:&mdash; &lsquo;One expence, however, I would not have you to spare: let nothing be omitted that can preserve Mrs. Boswell, though it should be necessary to transplant her for a time into a softer climate. She is the prop and stay of your life. How much must your children suffer by losing her.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">My wife was now so much convinced of his sincere friendship for me, and regard for her, that, without any suggestion on my part, she wrote him a very polite and grateful letter: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;DR. JOHNSON TO MRS. BOSWELL.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;DEAR LADY, &mdash; I have not often received so much pleasure as from your invitation to Auchinleck. The journey thither and back is, indeed, too great for the latter part of the year; but if my health were fully recovered, I would suffer no little heat and cold, nor a wet or a rough road to keep me from you. I am, indeed, not without hope of seeing Auchinleek again; but to make it a pleasant place I must see its lady well, and brisk, and airy. For my sake, therefore, among many greater reasons, take care, dear Madam, of your health, spare no expence, and want no attendance that can procure ease, or preserve it. Be very careful to keep your mind quiet; and do not think it too much to give an account of your recovery to, Madam, yours, &amp;c.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;London, Sept. 7, 1782.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">The death of Mr. Thrale had made a very material alteration with respect to Johnson&rsquo;s reception in that family. The manly authority of the husband no longer curbed the lively exuberance of the lady; and as her vanity had been fully gratified, by having the Colossus of Literature attached to her for many years, she gradually became less assiduous to please him. Whether her attachment to him was already divided by another object, I am unable to ascertain; but it is plain that Johnson&rsquo;s penetration was alive to her neglect or forced attention; for on the 6th of October this year, we find him making a &lsquo;parting use of the library&rsquo; at Streatham, and pronouncing a prayer, which he composed on leaving Mr. Thrale&rsquo;s family: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Almighty God, Father of all mercy, help me by thy grace, that I may, with humble and sincere thankfulness, remember the comforts and conveniences which I have enjoyed at this place; and that I may resign them with holy submission, equally trusting in thy protection when thou givest, and when thou takest away. Have mercy upon me, O Lord, have mercy upon me.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To thy fatherly protection, O Lord, I commend this family. Bless, guide, and defend them, that they may so pass through this world, as finally to enjoy in thy presence everlasting happiness, for Jesus Christ&rsquo;s sake. Amen.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">One cannot read this prayer, without some emotions not very favourable to the lady whose conduct occasioned it.</p>
<p class="p24">In one of his memorandum-books I find, &lsquo;Sunday, went to church at Streatham. Templo valedixi cam osculo.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He met Mr. Philip Metcalfe often at Sir Joshua Reynolds&rsquo;s, and other places, and was a good deal with him at Brighthelmston this autumn, being pleased at once with his excellent table and animated conversation. Mr. Metcalfe shewed him great respect, and sent him a note that he might have the use of his carriage whenever he pleased. Johnson (3rd October, 1782) returned this polite answer:&mdash; &lsquo;Mr. Johnson is very much obliged by the kind offer of the carriage, but he has no desire of using Mr. Metcalfe&rsquo;s carriage, except when he can have the pleasure of Mr. Metcalfe&rsquo;s company.&rsquo; Mr. Metcalfe could not but be highly pleased that his company was thus valued by Johnson, and he frequently attended him in airings. They also went together to Chichester, and they visited Petworth, and Cowdry, the venerable seat of the Lords Montacute. &lsquo;Sir, (said Johnson,) I should like to stay here four-and-twenty hours. We see here how our ancestors lived.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;TO SIR JOSHUA REYNOLDS.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;DEAR SIR, &mdash; I heard yesterday of your late disorder, and should think ill of myself if I had heard of it without alarm. I heard likewise of your recovery, which I sincerely wish to be complete and permanent. Your country has been in danger of losing one of its brightest ornaments, and I of losing one of my oldest and kindest friends: but I hope you will still live long, for the honour of the nation: and that more enjoyment of your elegance, your intelligence, and your benevolence, is still reserved for, dear Sir, your most affectionate, &amp;c.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Brighthelmston, Nov. 14, 1782.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">1783: AETAT. 74.] &mdash; In 1783, he was more severely afflicted than ever, as will appear in the course of his correspondence; but still the same ardour for literature, the same constant piety, the same kindness for his friends, and the same vivacity both in conversation and writing, distinguished him.</p>
<p class="p24">On Friday, March 21, having arrived in London the night before, I was glad to find him at Mrs. Thrale&rsquo;s house, in Argyll-street, appearances of friendship between them being still kept up. I was shewn into his room, and after the first salutation he said, &lsquo;I am glad you are come. I am very ill.&rsquo; He looked pale, and was distressed with a difficulty of breathing; but after the common inquiries he assumed his usual strong animated style of conversation. Seeing me now for the first time as a Laird, or proprietor of land, he began thus: &lsquo;Sir, the superiority of a country-gentleman over the people upon his estate is very agreeable; and he who says he does not feel it to be agreeable, lies; for it must be agreeable to have a casual superiority over those who are by nature equal with us.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Yet, Sir, we see great proprietors of land who prefer living in London.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, the pleasure of living in London, the intellectual superiority that is enjoyed there, may counterbalance the other. Besides, Sir, a man may prefer the state of the country-gentleman upon the whole, and yet there may never be a moment when he is willing to make the change to quit London for it.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He talked with regret and indignation of the factious opposition to Government at this time, and imputed it in a great measure to the Revolution. &lsquo;Sir, (said he, in a low voice, having come nearer to me, while his old prejudices seemed to be fermenting in his mind,) this Hanoverian family is isolee here. They have no friends. Now the Stuarts had friends who stuck by them so late as 1745. When the right of the King is not reverenced, there will not be reverence for those appointed by the King.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He repeated to me his verses on Mr. Levett, with an emotion which gave them full effect; and then he was pleased to say, &lsquo;You must be as much with me as you can. You have done me good. You cannot think how much better I am since you came in.</p>
<p class="p24">He sent a message to acquaint Mrs. Thrale that I was arrived. I had not seen her since her husband&rsquo;s death. She soon appeared, and favoured me with an invitation to stay to dinner, which I accepted. There was no other company but herself and three of her daughters, Dr. Johnson, and I. She too said, she was very glad I was come, for she was going to Bath, and should have been sorry to leave Dr. Johnson before I came. This seemed to be attentive and kind; and I who had not been informed of any change, imagined all to be as well as formerly. He was little inclined to talk at dinner, and went to sleep after it; but when he joined us in the drawing-room, he seemed revived, and was again himself.</p>
<p class="p24">Talking of conversation, he said, &lsquo;There must, in the first place, be knowledge, there must be materials; in the second place, there must be a command of words; in the third place, there must be imagination, to place things in such views as they are not commonly seen in; and in the fourth place, there must be presence of mind, and a resolution that is not to be overcome by failures: this last is an essential requisite; for want of it many people do not excel in conversation. Now I want it: I throw up the game upon losing a trick.&rsquo; I wondered to hear him talk thus of himself, and said, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know, Sir, how this may be; but I am sure you beat other people&rsquo;s cards out of their hands.&rsquo; I doubt whether he heard this remark. While he went on talking triumphantly, I was fixed in admiration, and said to Mrs. Thrale, &lsquo;O, for short-hand to take this down!&rsquo; &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll carry it all in your head, (said she;) a long head is as good as short-hand.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">It has been observed and wondered at, that Mr. Charles Fox never talked with any freedom in the presence of Dr. Johnson, though it is well known, and I myself can witness, that his conversation is various, fluent, and exceedingly agreeable. Johnson&rsquo;s own experience, however, of that gentleman&rsquo;s reserve was a sufficient reason for his going on thus: &lsquo;Fox never talks in private company; not from any determination not to talk, but because he has not the first motion. A man who is used to the applause of the House of Commons, has no wish for that of a private company. A man accustomed to throw for a thousand pounds, if set down to throw for sixpence, would not be at the pains to count his dice. Burke&rsquo;s talk is the ebullition of his mind; he does not talk from a desire of distinction, but because his mind is full.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">After musing for some time, he said, &lsquo;I wonder how I should have any enemies; for I do harm to nobody.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;In the first place, Sir, you will be pleased to recollect, that you set out with attacking the Scotch; so you got a whole nation for your enemies.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, I own, that by my definition of OATS I meant to vex them.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Pray, Sir, can you trace the cause of your antipathy to the Scotch?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;I cannot, Sir.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Old Mr. Sheridan says, it was because they sold Charles the First.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Then, Sir, old Mr. Sheridan has found out a very good reason.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I had paid a visit to General Oglethorpe in the morning,* and was told by him that Dr. Johnson saw company on Saturday evenings, and he would meet me at Johnson&rsquo;s that night. When I mentioned this to Johnson, not doubting that it would please him, as he had a great value for Oglethorpe, the fretfulness of his disease unexpectedly shewed itself; his anger suddenly kindled, and he said, with vehemence, &lsquo;Did not you tell him not to come? Am I to be HUNTED in this manner?&rsquo; I satisfied him that I could not divine that the visit would not be convenient, and that I certainly could not take it upon me of my own accord to forbid the General.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* March 22. &mdash; Ed.</p>
<p class="p24">I found Dr. Johnson in the evening in Mrs. Williams&rsquo;s room, at tea and coffee with her and Mrs. Desmoulins, who were also both ill; it was a sad scene, and he was not in very good humour. He said of a performance that had lately come out, &lsquo;Sir, if you should search all the madhouses in England, you would not find ten men who would write so, and think it sense.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I was glad when General Oglethorpe&rsquo;s arrival was announced, and we left the ladies. Dr. Johnson attended him in the parlour, and was as courteous as ever.</p>
<p class="p24">On Sunday, March 23, I breakfasted with Dr. Johnson, who seemed much relieved, having taken opium the night before. He however protested against it, as a remedy that should be given with the utmost reluctance, and only in extreme necessity. I mentioned how commonly it was used in Turkey, and that therefore it could not be so pernicious as he apprehended. He grew warm and said, &lsquo;Turks take opium, and Christians take opium; but Russel, in his Account of Aleppo, tells us, that it is as disgraceful in Turkey to take too much opium, as it is with us to get drunk. Sir, it is amazing how things are exaggerated. A gentleman was lately telling in a company where I was present, that in France as soon as a man of fashion marries, he takes an opera girl into keeping; and this he mentioned as a general custom. &ldquo;Pray, Sir, (said I,) how many opera girls may there be?&rdquo; He answered, &ldquo;About fourscore.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well then, Sir, (said I,) you see there can be no more than fourscore men of fashion who can do this.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Mrs. Desmoulins made tea; and she and I talked before him upon a topick which he had once borne patiently from me when we were by ourselves, &mdash; his not complaining of the world, because he was not called to some great office, nor had attained to great wealth. He flew into a violent passion, I confess with some justice, and commanded us to have done. &lsquo;Nobody, (said he,) has a right to talk in this manner, to bring before a man his own character, and the events of his life, when he does not choose it should be done. I never have sought the world; the world was not to seek me. It is rather wonderful that so much has been done for me. All the complaints which are made of the world are unjust. I never knew a man of merit neglected: it was generally by his own fault that he failed of success. A man may hide his head in a hole: he may go into the country, and publish a book now and then, which nobody reads, and then complain he is neglected. There is no reason why any person should exert himself for a man who has written a good book: he has not written it for any individual. I may as well make a present to the postman who brings me a letter. When patronage was limited, an authour expected to find a Maecenas, and complained if he did not find one. Why should he complain? This Maecenas has others as good as he, or others who have got the start of him.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On the subject of the right employment of wealth, Johnson observed, &lsquo;A man cannot make a bad use of his money, so far as regards Society, if he does not hoard it; for if he either spends it or lends it out, Society has the benefit. It is in general better to spend money than to give it away; for industry is more promoted by spending money than by giving it away. A man who spends his money is sure he is doing good with it: he is not so sure when he gives it away. A man who spends ten thousand a year will do more good than a man who spends two thousand and gives away eight.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">In the evening I came to him again. He was somewhat fretful from his illness. A gentleman asked him, whether he had been abroad to-day. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t talk so childishly, (said he.) You may as well ask if I hanged myself to-day.&rsquo; I mentioned politicks. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, I&rsquo;d as soon have a man to break my bones as talk to me of publick affairs, internal or external. I have lived to see things all as bad as they can be.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He said, &lsquo;Goldsmith&rsquo;s blundering speech to Lord Shelburne, which has been so often mentioned, and which he really did make to him, was only a blunder in emphasis: &ldquo;I wonder they should call your Lordship Malagrida, for Malagrida was a very good man;&rdquo; meant, I wonder they should use Malagrida as a term of reproach.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Soon after this time I had an opportunity of seeing, by means of one of his friends, a proof that his talents, as well as his obliging service to authours, were ready as ever. He had revised The Village, an admirable poem, by the Reverend Mr. Crabbe. Its sentiments as to the false notions of rustick happiness and rustick virtue were quite congenial with his own; and he had taken the trouble not only to suggest slight corrections and variations, but to furnish some lines, when he thought he could give the writer&rsquo;s meaning better than in the words of the manuscript.</p>
<p class="p24">On Sunday, March 30, I found him at home in the evening, and had the pleasure to meet with Dr. Brocklesby, whose reading, and knowledge of life, and good spirits, supply him with a never-failing source of conversation.</p>
<p class="p24">I shall here insert a few of Johnson&rsquo;s sayings, without the formality of dates, as they have no reference to any particular time or place.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The more a man extends and varies his acquaintance the better.&rsquo; This, however, was meant with a just restriction; for, he on another occasion said to me, &lsquo;Sir, a man may be so much of every thing, that he is nothing of any thing.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;It is a very good custom to keep a journal for a man&rsquo;s own use; he may write upon a card a day all that is necessary to be written, after he has had experience of life. At first there is a great deal to be written, because there is a great deal of novelty; but when once a man has settled his opinions, there is seldom much to be set down.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Talking of an acquaintance of ours, whose narratives, which abounded in curious and interesting topicks, were unhappily found to be very fabulous; I mentioned Lord Mansfield&rsquo;s having said to me, &lsquo;Suppose we believe one HALF of what he tells.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Ay; but we don&rsquo;t know WHICH half to believe. By his lying we lose not only our reverence for him, but all comfort in his conversation.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;May we not take it as amusing fiction?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, the misfortune is, that you will insensibly believe as much of it as you incline to believe.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">It is remarkable, that notwithstanding their congeniality in politicks, he never was acquainted with a late eminent noble judge, whom I have heard speak of him as a writer, with great respect. Johnson, I know not upon what degree of investigation, entertained no exalted opinion of his Lordship&rsquo;s intellectual character. Talking of him to me one day, he said, &lsquo;It is wonderful, Sir, with how little real superiority of mind men can make an eminent figure in publick life.&rsquo; He expressed himself to the same purpose concerning another law-Lord, who, it seems, once took a fancy to associate with the wits of London; but with so little success, that Foote said, &lsquo;What can he mean by coming among us? He is not only dull himself, but the cause of dullness in others.&rsquo; Trying him by the test of his colloquial powers, Johnson had found him very defective. He once said to Sir Joshua Reynolds, &lsquo;This man now has been ten years about town, and has made nothing of it;&rsquo; meaning as a companion. He said to me, &lsquo;I never heard any thing from him in company that was at all striking; and depend upon it, Sir, it is when you come close to a man in conversation, that you discover what his real abilities are; to make a speech in a publick assembly is a knack. Now I honour Thurlow, Sir; Thurlow is a fine fellow; he fairly puts his mind to yours.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">After repeating to him some of his pointed, lively sayings, I said, &lsquo;It is a pity, Sir, you don&rsquo;t always remember your own good things, that you may have a laugh when you will.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Nay, Sir, it is better that I forget them, that I may be reminded of them, and have a laugh on their being brought to my recollection.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">When I recalled to him his having said as we sailed up Loch-lomond, &lsquo;That if he wore any thing fine, it should be VERY fine;&rsquo; I observed that all his thoughts were upon a great scale. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Depend upon it, Sir, every man will have as fine a thing as he can get; as a large diamond for his ring.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Pardon me, Sir: a man of a narrow mind will not think of it, a slight trinket will satisfy him:</p>
<p class="p24">&ldquo;Nec sufferre queat majoris pondera gemmae.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I told him I should send him some Essays which I had written, which I hoped he would be so good as to read, and pick out the good ones. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Nay, Sir, send me only the good ones; don&rsquo;t make ME pick them.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">As a small proof of his kindliness and delicacy of feeling, the following circumstance may be mentioned: One evening when we were in the street together, and I told him I was going to sup at Mr. Beauclerk&rsquo;s, he said, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll go with you.&rsquo; After having walked part of the way, seeming to recollect something, he suddenly stopped and said, &lsquo;I cannot go, &mdash; but I do not love Beauclerk the less.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On the frame of his portrait, Mr. Beauclerk had inscribed, &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo; &mdash;&mdash;&nbsp; &mdash;&mdash; Ingenium ingens</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inculto latet hoc sub corpore.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">After Mr. Beauclerk&rsquo;s death, when it became Mr. Langton&rsquo;s property, he made the inscription be defaced. Johnson said complacently, &lsquo;It was kind in you to take it off;&rsquo; and then after a short pause, added, &lsquo;and not unkind in him to put it on.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He said, &lsquo;How few of his friends&rsquo; houses would a man choose to be at when he is sick.&rsquo; He mentioned one or two. I recollect only Thrale&rsquo;s.</p>
<p class="p24">He observed, &lsquo;There is a wicked inclination in most people to suppose an old man decayed in his intellects. If a young or middle-aged man, when leaving a company, does not recollect where he laid his hat, it is nothing; but if the same inattention is discovered in an old man, people will shrug up their shoulders, and say, &ldquo;His memory is going.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Sir Joshua Reynolds communicated to me the following particulars: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">Johnson thought the poems published as translations from Ossian had so little merit, that he said, &lsquo;Sir, a man might write such stuff for ever, if he would ABANDON his mind to it.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He said, &lsquo;A man should pass a part of his time with THE LAUGHERS, by which means any thing ridiculous or particular about him might be presented to his view, and corrected.&rsquo; I observed, he must have been a bold laugher who would have ventured to tell Dr. Johnson of any of his particularities.*</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* I am happy, however, to mention a pleasing instance of his</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;enduring with great gentleness to hear one of his most</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;striking particularities pointed out: &mdash; Miss Hunter, a niece</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of his friend Christopher Smart, when a very young girl,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;struck by his extraordinary motions, said to him, Pray, Dr.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Johnson, why do you make such strange gestures?&rsquo;&nbsp; From bad</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;habit, he replied.&nbsp; &lsquo;Do you, my dear, take care to guard</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;against bad habits.&rsquo;&nbsp; This I was told by the young lady&rsquo;s</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;brother at Margate. &mdash; Boswell.</p>
<p class="p24">Dr. Goldsmith said once to Dr. Johnson, that he wished for some additional members to THE LITERARY CLUB, to give it an agreeable variety; for (said he,) there can now be nothing new among us: we have travelled over one another&rsquo;s minds. Johnson seemed a little angry, and said, &lsquo;Sir, you have not travelled over MY mind, I promise you.&rsquo; Sir Joshua, however, thought Goldsmith right; observing, that &lsquo;when people have lived a great deal together, they know what each of them will say on every subject. A new understanding, therefore, is desirable; because though it may only furnish the same sense upon a question which would have been furnished by those with whom we are accustomed to live, yet this sense will have a different colouring; and colouring is of much effect in every thing else as well as in painting.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson used to say that he made it a constant rule to talk as well as he could both as to sentiment and expression, by which means, what had been originally effort became familiar and easy. The consequence of this, Sir Joshua observed, was, that his common conversation in all companies was such as to secure him universal attention, as something above the usual colloquial style was expected.</p>
<p class="p24">Yet, though Johnson had this habit in company, when another mode was necessary, in order to investigate truth, he could descend to a language intelligible to the meanest capacity. An instance of this was witnessed by Sir Joshua Reynolds, when they were present at an examination of a little blackguard boy, by Mr. Saunders Welch, the late Westminster Justice. Welch, who imagined that he was exalting himself in Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s eyes by using big words, spoke in a manner that was utterly unintelligible to the boy; Dr. Johnson perceiving it, addressed himself to the boy, and changed the pompous phraseology into colloquial language. Sir Joshua Reynolds, who was much amused by this procedure, which seemed a kind of reversing of what might have been expected from the two men, took notice of it to Dr. Johnson, as they walked away by themselves. Johnson said, that it was continually the case; and that he was always obliged to TRANSLATE the Justice&rsquo;s swelling diction, (smiling,) so as that his meaning might be understood by the vulgar, from whom information was to be obtained.</p>
<p class="p24">Sir Joshua once observed to him, that he had talked above the capacity of some people with whom they had been in company together. &lsquo;No matter, Sir, (said Johnson;) they consider it as a compliment to be talked to, as if they were wiser than they are. So true is this, Sir, that Baxter made it a rule in every sermon that he preached, to say something that was above the capacity of his audience.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson&rsquo;s dexterity in retort, when he seemed to be driven to an extremity by his adversary, was very remarkable. Of his power in this respect, our common friend, Mr. Windham of Norfolk, has been pleased to furnish me with an eminent instance. However unfavourable to Scotland, he uniformly gave liberal praise to George Buchanan, as a writer. In a conversation concerning the literary merits of the two countries, in which Buchanan was introduced, a Scotchman, imagining that on this ground he should have an undoubted triumph over him, exclaimed, &lsquo;Ah, Dr. Johnson, what would you have said of Buchanan, had he been an Englishman?&rsquo; &lsquo;Why, Sir, (said Johnson, after a little pause,) I should NOT have said of Buchanan, had he been an ENGLISHMAN, what I will now say of him as a SCOTCHMAN, &mdash; that he was the only man of genius his country ever produced.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Though his usual phrase for conversation was TALK, yet he made a distinction; for when he once told me that he dined the day before at a friend&rsquo;s house, with &lsquo;a very pretty company;&rsquo; and I asked him if there was good conversation, he answered, &lsquo;No, Sir; we had TALK enough, but no CONVERSATION; there was nothing DISCUSSED.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Such was his sensibility, and so much was he affected by pathetick poetry, that, when he was reading Dr. Beattie&rsquo;s Hermit in my presence, it brought tears into his eyes.</p>
<p class="p24">Mr. Hoole told him, he was born in Moorfields, and had received part of his early instruction in Grub-street. &lsquo;Sir, (said Johnson, smiling,) you have been REGULARLY educated.&rsquo; Having asked who was his instructor, and Mr. Hoole having answered, &lsquo;My uncle, Sir, who was a taylor;&rsquo; Johnson, recollecting himself, said, &lsquo;Sir, I knew him; we called him the metaphysical taylor. He was of a club in Old-street, with me and George Psalmanazar, and some others: but pray, Sir, was he a good taylor?&rsquo; Mr. Hoole having answered that he believed he was too mathematical, and used to draw squares and triangles on his shop-board, so that he did not excel in the cut of a coat;&mdash; &lsquo;I am sorry for it (said Johnson,) for I would have every man to be master of his own business.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">In pleasant reference to himself and Mr. Hoole, as brother authours, he often said, &lsquo;Let you and I, Sir, go together, and eat a beef-steak in Grub-street.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He said to Sir William Scott, &lsquo;The age is running mad after innovation; all the business of the world is to be done in a new way; men are to be hanged in a new way; Tyburn itself is not safe from the fury of innovation.&rsquo; It having been argued that this was an improvement,&mdash; &lsquo;No, Sir, (said he, eagerly,) it is NOT an improvement: they object that the old method drew together a number of spectators. Sir, executions are intended to draw spectators. If they do not draw spectators they don&rsquo;t answer their purpose. The old method was most satisfactory to all parties; the publick was gratified by a procession; the criminal was supported by it. Why is all this to be swept away?&rsquo; I perfectly agree with Dr. Johnson upon this head, and am persuaded that executions now, the solemn procession being discontinued, have not nearly the effect which they formerly had. Magistrates both in London, and elsewhere, have, I am afraid, in this had too much regard to their own case.</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson&rsquo;s attention to precision and clearness in expression was very remarkable. He disapproved of parentheses; and I believe in all his voluminous writings, not half a dozen of them will be found. He never used the phrases the former and the latter, having observed, that they often occasioned obscurity; he therefore contrived to construct his sentences so as not to have occasion for them, and would even rather repeat the same words, in order to avoid them. Nothing is more common than to mistake surnames when we hear them carelessly uttered for the first time. To prevent this, he used not only to pronounce them slowly and distinctly, but to take the trouble of spelling them; a practice which I have often followed; and which I wish were general.</p>
<p class="p24">Such was the heat and irritability of his blood, that not only did he pare his nails to the quick; but scraped the joints of his fingers with a pen-knife, till they seemed quite red and raw.</p>
<p class="p24">The heterogeneous composition of human nature was remarkably exemplified in Johnson. His liberality in giving his money to persons in distress was extraordinary. Yet there lurked about him a propensity to paultry saving. One day I owned to him that &lsquo;I was occasionally troubled with a fit of NARROWNESS.&rsquo; &lsquo;Why, Sir, (said he,) so am I. BUT I DO NOT TELL IT.&rsquo; He has now and then borrowed a shilling of me; and when I asked for it again, seemed to be rather out of humour. A droll little circumstance once occurred: as if he meant to reprimand my minute exactness as a creditor, he thus addressed me;&mdash; &lsquo;Boswell, LEND me sixpence &mdash; NOT TO BE REPAID.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">This great man&rsquo;s attention to small things was very remarkable. As an instance of it, he one day said to me, &lsquo;Sir, when you get silver in change for a guinea, look carefully at it; you may find some curious piece of coin.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Though a stern TRUE-BORN ENGLISHMAN, and fully prejudiced against all other nations, he had discernment enough to see, and candour enough to censure, the cold reserve too common among Englishmen towards strangers: &lsquo;Sir, (said he,) two men of any other nation who are shewn into a room together, at a house where they are both visitors, will immediately find some conversation. But two Englishmen will probably go each to a different window, and remain in obstinate silence. Sir, we as yet do not enough understand the common rights of humanity.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson, for sport perhaps, or from the spirit of contradiction, eagerly maintained that Derrick had merit as a writer. Mr. Morgann* argued with him directly, in vain. At length he had recourse to this device. &lsquo;Pray, Sir, (said he,) whether do you reckon Derrick or Smart the best poet?&rsquo; Johnson at once felt himself roused; and answered, &lsquo;Sir, there is no settling the point of precedency between a louse and a flea.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Author of the Essay on the Character of Falstaff. &mdash; ED.</p>
<p class="p24">He was pleased to say to me one morning when we were left alone in his study, &lsquo;Boswell, I think I am easier with you than with almost any body.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He would not allow Mr. David Hume any credit for his political principles, though similar to his own; saying of him, &lsquo;Sir, he was a Tory by chance.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">His acute observation of human life made him remark, &lsquo;Sir, there is nothing by which a man exasperates most people more, than by displaying a superiour ability or brilliancy in conversation. They seem pleased at the time; but their envy makes them curse him in their hearts.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson&rsquo;s love of little children, which he discovered upon all occasions, calling them &lsquo;pretty dears,&rsquo; and giving them sweetmeats, was an undoubted proof of the real humanity and gentleness of his disposition.</p>
<p class="p24">His uncommon kindness to his servants, and serious concern, not only for their comfort in this world, but their happiness in the next, was another unquestionable evidence of what all, who were intimately acquainted with him, knew to be true.</p>
<p class="p24">Nor would it be just, under this head, to omit the fondness which he shewed for animals which he had taken under his protection. I never shall forget the indulgence with which he treated Hodge, his cat: for whom he himself used to go out and buy oysters, lest the servants having that trouble should take a dislike to the poor creature. I am, unluckily, one of those who have an antipathy to a cat, so that I am uneasy when in the room with one; and I own, I frequently suffered a good deal from the presence of this same Hodge. I recollect him one day scrambling up Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s breast, apparently with much satisfaction, while my friend smiling and half-whistling, rubbed down his back, and pulled him by the tail; and when I observed he was a fine cat, saying, &lsquo;Why yes, Sir, but I have had cats whom I liked better than this;&rsquo; and then as if perceiving Hodge to be out of countenance, adding, &lsquo;but he is a very fine cat, a very fine cat indeed.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">This reminds me of the ludicrous account which he gave Mr. Langton, of the despicable state of a young Gentleman of good family. &lsquo;Sir, when I heard of him last, he was running about town shooting cats.&rsquo; And then in a sort of kindly reverie, he bethought himself of his own favourite cat, and said, &lsquo;But Hodge shan&rsquo;t be shot; no, no, Hodge shall not be shot.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Thursday, April 10, I introduced to him, at his house in Bolt-court, the Honourable and Reverend William Stuart, son of the Earl of Bute; a gentleman truly worthy of being known to Johnson; being, with all the advantages of high birth, learning, travel, and elegant manners, an exemplary parish priest in every respect.</p>
<p class="p24">After some compliments on both sides, the tour which Johnson and I had made to the Hebrides was mentioned. JOHNSON. &lsquo;I got an acquisition of more ideas by it than by any thing that I remember. I saw quite a different system of life.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;You would not like to make the same journey again?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why no, Sir; not the same: it is a tale told. Gravina, an Italian critick, observes, that every man desires to see that of which he has read; but no man desires to read an account of what he has seen: so much does description fall short of reality. Description only excites curiosity: seeing satisfies it. Other people may go and see the Hebrides.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;I should wish to go and see some country totally different from what I have been used to; such as Turkey, where religion and every thing else are different.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Yes, Sir; there are two objects of curiosity, &mdash; the Christian world, and the Mahometan world. All the rest may be considered as barbarous.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Pray, Sir, is the Turkish Spy a genuine book?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;No, Sir. Mrs. Manley, in her Life, says that her father wrote the first two volumes: and in another book, Dunton&rsquo;s Life and Errours, we find that the rest was written by one Sault, at two guineas a sheet, under the direction of Dr. Midgeley.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">About this time he wrote to Mrs. Lucy Porter, mentioning his bad health, and that he intended a visit to Lichfield. &lsquo;It is, (says he,) with no great expectation of amendment that I make every year a journey into the country; but it is pleasant to visit those whose kindness has been often experienced.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On April 18, (being Good-Friday,) I found him at breakfast, in his usual manner upon that day, drinking tea without milk, and eating a cross-bun to prevent faintness; we went to St. Clement&rsquo;s church, as formerly. When we came home from church, he placed himself on one of the stone-seats at his garden-door, and I took the other, and thus in the open air and in a placid frame of mind, he talked away very easily. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Were I a country gentleman, I should not be very hospitable, I should not have crowds in my house.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Sir Alexander Dick tells me, that he remembers having a thousand people in a year to dine at his house: that is, reckoning each person as one, each time that he dined there.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;That, Sir, is about three a day.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;How your statement lessens the idea.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;That, Sir, is the good of counting. It brings every thing to a certainty, which before floated in the mind indefinitely.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">BOSWELL. &lsquo;I wish to have a good walled garden.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think it would be worth the expence to you. We compute in England, a park wall at a thousand pounds a mile; now a garden-wall must cost at least as much. You intend your trees should grow higher than a deer will leap. Now let us see; for a hundred pounds you could only have forty-four square yards, which is very little; for two hundred pounds, you may have eighty-four square yards, which is very well. But when will you get the value of two hundred pounds of walls, in fruit, in your climate? No, Sir, such contention with Nature is not worth while. I would plant an orchard, and have plenty of such fruit as ripen well in your country. My friend, Dr. Madden, of Ireland, said, that &ldquo;in an orchard there should be enough to eat, enough to lay up, enough to be stolen, and enough to rot upon the ground.&rdquo; Cherries are an early fruit, you may have them; and you may have the early apples and pears.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;We cannot have nonpareils.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, you can no more have nonpareils than you can have grapes.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;We have them, Sir; but they are very bad.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Nay, Sir, never try to have a thing merely to shew that you CANNOT have it. From ground that would let for forty shillings you may have a large orchard; and you see it costs you only forty shillings. Nay, you may graze the ground when the trees are grown up; you cannot while they are young.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Is not a good garden a very common thing in England, Sir?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Not so common, Sir, as you imagine. In Lincolnshire there is hardly an orchard; in Staffordshire very little fruit.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Has Langton no orchard?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;No, Sir.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;How so, Sir?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, from the general negligence of the county. He has it not, because nobody else has it.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;A hot-house is a certain thing; I may have that.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;A hot-house is pretty certain; but you must first build it, then you must keep fires in it, and you must have a gardener to take care of it.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;But if I have a gardener at any rate ?&mdash; &lsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, yes.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;I&rsquo;d have it near my house; there is no need to have it in the orchard.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Yes, I&rsquo;d have it near my house. I would plant a great many currants; the fruit is good, and they make a pretty sweetmeat.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I record this minute detail, which some may think trifling, in order to shew clearly how this great man, whose mind could grasp such large and extensive subjects, as he has shewn in his literary labours, was yet well-informed in the common affairs of life, and loved to illustrate them.</p>
<p class="p24">Talking of the origin of language; JOHNSON. &lsquo;It must have come by inspiration. A thousand, nay, a million of children could not invent a language. While the organs are pliable, there is not understanding enough to form a language; by the time that there is understanding enough, the organs are become stiff. We know that after a certain age we cannot learn to pronounce a new language. No foreigner, who comes to England when advanced in life, ever pronounces English tolerably well; at least such instances are very rare. When I maintain that language must have come by inspiration, I do not mean that inspiration is required for rhetorick, and all the beauties of language; for when once man has language, we can conceive that he may gradually form modifications of it. I mean only that inspiration seems to me to be necessary to give man the faculty of speech; to inform him that he may have speech; which I think he could no more find out without inspiration, than cows or hogs would think of such a faculty.&rsquo; WALKER. &lsquo;Do you think, Sir, that there are any perfect synonimes in any language?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Originally there were not; but by using words negligently, or in poetry, one word comes to be confounded with another.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He talked of Dr. Dodd. &lsquo;A friend of mine, (said he,) came to me and told me, that a lady wished to have Dr. Dodd&rsquo;s picture in a bracelet, and asked me for a motto. I said, I could think of no better than Currat Lex. I was very willing to have him pardoned, that is, to have the sentence changed to transportation: but, when he was once hanged, I did not wish he should be made a saint.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Mrs. Burney, wife of his friend Dr. Burney, came in, and he seemed to be entertained with her conversation.</p>
<p class="p24">Garrick&rsquo;s funeral was talked of as extravagantly expensive. Johnson, from his dislike to exaggeration, would not allow that it was distinguished by any extraordinary pomp. &lsquo;Were there not six horses to each coach?&rsquo; said Mrs. Burney. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Madam, there were no more six horses than six phoenixes.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Time passed on in conversation till it was too late for the service of the church at three o&rsquo;clock. I took a walk, and left him alone for some time; then returned, and we had coffee and conversation again by ourselves.</p>
<p class="p24">We went to evening prayers at St. Clement&rsquo;s, at seven, and then parted.</p>
<p class="p24">On Sunday, April 20, being Easter-day, after attending solemn service at St. Paul&rsquo;s, I came to Dr. Johnson, and found Mr. Lowe, the painter, sitting with him. Mr. Lowe mentioned the great number of new buildings of late in London, yet that Dr. Johnson had observed, that the number of inhabitants was not increased. JOHNSON. Why, Sir, the bills of mortality prove that no more people die now than formerly; so it is plain no more live. The register of births proves nothing, for not one tenth of the people of London are born there.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;I believe, Sir, a great many of the children born in London die early.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, yes, Sir.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;But those who do live, are as stout and strong people as any: Dr. Price says, they must be naturally stronger to get through.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;That is system, Sir. A great traveller observes, that it is said there are no weak or deformed people among the Indians; but he with much sagacity assigns the reason of this, which is, that the hardship of their life as hunters and fishers does not allow weak or diseased children to grow up. Now had I been an Indian, I must have died early; my eyes would not have served me to get food. I indeed now could fish, give me English tackle; but had I been an Indian I must have starved, or they would have knocked me on the head, when they saw I could do nothing.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Perhaps they would have taken care of you: we are told they are fond of oratory, you would have talked to them.&rsquo; JOHNSON. Nay, Sir, I should not have lived long enough to be fit to talk; I should have been dead before I was ten years old. Depend upon it, Sir, a savage, when he is hungry, will not carry about with him a looby of nine years old, who cannot help himself. They have no affection, Sir.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;I believe natural affection, of which we hear so much, is very small.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, natural affection is nothing: but affection from principle and established duty is sometimes wonderfully strong.&rsquo; LOWE. &lsquo;A hen, Sir, will feed her chickens in preference to herself.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;But we don&rsquo;t know that the hen is hungry; let the hen be fairly hungry, and I&rsquo;ll warrant she&rsquo;ll peck the corn herself. A cock, I believe, will feed hens instead of himself; but we don&rsquo;t know that the cock is hungry.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;And that, Sir, is not from affection but gallantry. But some of the Indians have affection.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, that they help some of their children is plain; for some of them live, which they could not do without being helped.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I dined with him; the company were, Mrs. Williams, Mrs. Desmoulins, and Mr. Lowe. He seemed not to be well, talked little, grew drowsy soon after dinner, and retired, upon which I went away.</p>
<p class="p24">Having next day gone to Mr. Burke&rsquo;s seat in the country, from whence I was recalled by an express, that a near relation of mine had killed his antagonist in a duel, and was himself dangerously wounded, I saw little of Dr. Johnson till Monday, April 28, when I spent a considerable part of the day with him, and introduced the subject, which then chiefly occupied my mind. JOHNSON. &lsquo;I do not see, Sir, that fighting is absolutely forbidden in Scripture; I see revenge forbidden, but not self-defence.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;The Quakers say it is; &ldquo;Unto him that smiteth thee on one cheek, offer him also the other.&rdquo;&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;But stay, Sir; the text is meant only to have the effect of moderating passion; it is plain that we are not to take it in a literal sense. We see this from the context, where there are other recommendations, which I warrant you the Quaker will not take literally; as, for instance, &ldquo;From him that would borrow of thee, turn thou not away.&rdquo; Let a man whose credit is bad, come to a Quaker, and say, &ldquo;Well, Sir, lend me a hundred pounds;&rdquo; he&rsquo;ll find him as unwilling as any other man. No, Sir, a man may shoot the man who invades his character, as he may shoot him who attempts to break into his house.* So in 1745, my friend, Tom Gumming, the Quaker, said, he would not fight, but he would drive an ammunition cart; and we know that the Quakers have sent flannel waistcoats to our soldiers, to enable them to fight better.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;When a man is the aggressor, and by ill-usage forces on a duel in which he is killed, have we not little ground to hope that he is gone into a state of happiness?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, we are not to judge determinately of the state in which a man leaves this life. He may in a moment have repented effectually, and it is possible may have been accepted by GOD.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* I think it necessary to caution my readers against</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;concluding that in this or any other conversation of Dr.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Johnson, they have his serious and deliberate opinion on the</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;subject of duelling.&nbsp; In my Journal of a Tour to the</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hebrides, 3rd edit. p. 386 [p. 366, Oct. 24], it appears</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that he made this frank confession:&mdash; &lsquo;Nobody at times, talks</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;more laxly than I do;&rsquo; and, ib., p. 231 [Sept. 19, 1773],</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;He fairly owned he could not explain the rationality of</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;duelling.&rsquo;&nbsp; We may, therefore, infer, that he could not</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;think that justifiable, which seems so inconsistent with the</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;spirit of the Gospel. &mdash; BOSWELL.</p>
<p class="p24">Upon being told that old Mr. Sheridan, indignant at the neglect of his oratorical plans, had threatened to go to America; JOHNSON. &lsquo;I hope he will go to America.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;The Americans don&rsquo;t want oratory.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;But we can want Sheridan.&rsquo;</p>
