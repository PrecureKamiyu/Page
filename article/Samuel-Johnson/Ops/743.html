<h2 class="h20"><a id="a1817"></a><a id="a1816"></a>TROILUS AND CRESSIDA</h2>
<p class="p21">Prologue. (4,2)</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">And hither am I come</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">A prologue arm&rsquo;d; but not in confidence</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Of author&rsquo;s pen, or actor&rsquo;s voice; but suited</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">In like conditions as our argument</span>]</p>
<p class="p24">I come here to speak the prologue, and come in armour; not defying the audience, in confidence of either the author&rsquo;s or actor&rsquo;s abilities, but merely in a character suited to the subject, in a dress of war, before a warlike play.</p>
<p class="p24">I.i.12 (8,3) And skill-less as unpractis&rsquo;d infancy] Mr. Dryden, in his alteration of this play, has taken this speech as it stands, except that he has changed <span class="t8">skill-less</span> to <span class="t8">artless</span>, not for the better, because <span class="t8">skill-less</span> refers to <span class="t8">skill</span> and <span class="t8">skilful</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">I.i.58 (10,4) The cignet&rsquo;s down is harsh, and spirit of sense/Hard as the palm of ploughman!] <span class="t8">In comparison with</span> Cressid&rsquo;s <span class="t8">hand</span>, says he, <span class="t8">the spirit of sense</span>, the utmost degree, the most exquisite power of sensibility, which implies a soft hand, since the sense of touching, as Scaliger says in his <span class="t8">Exercitations</span>, resides chiefly in the fingers, is hard as the callous and insensible palm of the ploughman. WARBURTON reads,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&mdash; SPITE <span class="t8">of sense</span>:</p>
<p class="p24">HANMER,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&mdash; to th&rsquo; <span class="t8">spirit of sense</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">It is not proper to make a lover profess to praise his mistress in <span class="t8">spite of sense</span>; for though he often does it in <span class="t8">spite of the sense</span> of others, his own senses are subdued to his desires.</p>
<p class="p24">I.i.66 (10,5) if she be fair, &rsquo;tis the better for her; an she be not, she has the mends in her own hands] She may mend her complexion by the assistance of cosmeticks.</p>
<p class="p24">I.ii.4 (12,1) Hector, whose patience/Is, as a virtue, fix&rsquo;d] [W: Is as the] I think the present text may stand. Hector&rsquo;s patience was as a virtue, not variable and accidental, but fixed and constant. If I would alter it, it should be thus:</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&mdash; Hector, whose patience</p>
<p class="p24">Is ALL a virtue fix&rsquo;d, &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">All</span>, in old English, is the <span class="t8">intensive</span> or enforcing particle.</p>
<p class="p24">I.ii.8 (13,2) Before the sun rose, he was harness&rsquo;d light] [Warburton stated that &ldquo;harnessed light&rdquo; meant Hector was to fight on foot] How does it appear that Hector was to fight on foot rather to-day than on any other day? It is to be remembered, that the ancient heroes never fought on horseback; nor does their manner of fighting in chariots seem to require less activity than on foot.</p>
<p class="p24">I.ii.23 (14,4) his valour is crushed into folly] To be <span class="t8">crushed into folly</span>, is to be <span class="t8">confused</span> and mingled with <span class="t8">folly</span>, so as that they make one mass together.</p>
<p class="p24">I.ii.46 (15,6) Ilium] Was the palace of Troy.</p>
<p class="p24">I.ii.120 (17,7) compass-window] The <span class="t8">compass-window</span> is the same as the <span class="t8">bow-window</span>. (1773)</p>
<p class="p24">I.ii.212 (20,2)</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Cre.</span> Will he give you the nod?</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Pan.</span> You shall see.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Cre.</span> If he do, the rich shall have more]</p>
<p class="p24">[W: rich] I wonder why the commentator should think any emendation necessary, since his own sense is fully expressed by the present reading. Hanmer appears not to have understood the passage. That to <span class="t8">give the nod</span> signifies to <span class="t8">set a mark of folly</span>, I do not know; the allusion is to the word <span class="t8">noddy</span>, which, as now, did, in our author&rsquo;s time, and long before, signify, <span class="t8">a silly fellow</span>, and may, by its etymology, signify likewise <span class="t8">full of nods</span>. Cressid means, that <span class="t8">a</span> noddy <span class="t8">shall have more</span> nods. Of such remarks as these is a comment to consist?</p>
<p class="p24">I.ii.260 (22,3) money to boot] So the folio. The old quarto, with more force, Give <span class="t8">an eye</span> to boot. (rev. 1778, IX, 25, 1)</p>
<p class="p24">I.ii.285 (22,4) upon my wit to defend my wiles] So read both the copies) yet perhaps the author wrote,</p>
<p class="p24">Upon my wit to defend my will.</p>
<p class="p24">The terms <span class="t8">wit</span> and <span class="t8">will</span> were, in the language of that time, put often in opposition.</p>
<p class="p24">I.ii.300 (23,5) At your own house; there he unarms him] [These necessary words added from the quarto edition. POPE.] The words added are only, <span class="t8">there he unarms him</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">I.ii.313 (23,6) joy&rsquo;s soul lies in the doing] So read both the old editions, for which the later editions have poorly given,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&mdash; the <span class="t8">soul&rsquo;s joy</span> lies in doing.</p>
<p class="p24">I.ii.316 (23,7) That she] Means, that woman.</p>
<p class="p24">I.iii.31 (25,2) With due observance of thy godlike seat] [T: godlike seat] This emendation [for goodly seat] Theobald might have found in the quarto, which has,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&mdash; the <span class="t8">godlike</span> seat.</p>
<p class="p24">I.iii.32 (25,3) Nestor shall apply/Thy latest words] Nestor <span class="t8">applies</span> the words to another instance.</p>
<p class="p24">I.iii.54 (26,7) Returns to chiding fortune] For <span class="t8">returns</span>, Hanmer reads <span class="t8">replies</span>, unnecessarily, the sense being the same. The folio and quarto have <span class="t8">retires</span>, corruptly.</p>
<p class="p24">I.iii.62 (27,8)</p>
<p class="p24">both your speeches; which are such,</p>
<p class="p24">As Agamemnon and the hand of Greece</p>
<p class="p24">Should hold up high in brass; and such again,</p>
<p class="p24">As venerable Nestor, hatch&rsquo;d in silver,</p>
<p class="p24">Should with a bond of air (strong as the axle-tree</p>
<p class="p24">On which heaven rides) knit all the Greekish ears</p>
<p class="p24">To his experienc&rsquo;d tongue]</p>
<p class="p24">Ulysses begins his oration with praising those who had spoken before him, and marks the characteristick excellencies of their different eloquence, strength, and sweetness, which he expresses by the different metals on which he recommends them to be engraven for the instruction of posterity. The speech of Agamemnon is such that it ought to be engraven in brass, and the tablet held up by him on the one side, and Greece on the other, to shew the union of their opinion. And Nestor ought to be exhibited in silver, uniting all his audience in one mind by his soft and gentle elocution. Brass is the common emblem of strength, and silver of gentleness. We call a soft voice a <span class="t8">silver</span> voice, and a persuasive tongue a <span class="t8">silver</span> tongue. &mdash; I once read for <span class="t8">hand</span>, the <span class="t8">band</span> of Greece, but I think the text right. &mdash; To <span class="t8">hatch</span> is a term of art for a particular method of <span class="t8">engraving</span>. <span class="t8">Hatcher</span>, to cut, Fr.</p>
<p class="p24">I.iii.78 (28,1) The specialty of rule] The particular rights of supreme authority.</p>
<p class="p24">I.iii.81 (29,2) When that the general is not like the hive] The meaning is, <span class="t8">When the general is not</span> to the army <span class="t8">like the hive</span> to the bees, the repository of the stock of every individual, that to which each particular resorts with whatever be has collected for the good of the whole, <span class="t8">what honey is expected</span>? what hope of advantage? The sense is clear, the expression is confused.</p>
<p class="p24">I.iii.101 (30,5) Oh, when degree is shak&rsquo;d] I would read,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&mdash; So when degree is shak&rsquo;d. (see 1765, VII, 431, 5)</p>
<p class="p24">I.iii.103 (30,6) The enterprize] Perhaps we should read,</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Then</span> enterprize is sick! &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">I.iii.104 (30,7) brotherhoods in cities] Corporations, companies, <span class="t8">confraternities</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">I.iii.128 (31,8) That by a pace goes backward] That goes backward <span class="t8">step by step</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">I.iii.128 (31,9) with a purpose/It hath to climb] With a design in each man to aggrandize himself, by slighting his immediate superior.</p>
<p class="p24">I.iii.134 (31,1) bloodless emulation] An emulation not vigorous and active, but malignant and sluggish.</p>
<p class="p24">I.iii.152 (31,2) Thy topless deputation] <span class="t8">Topless</span> is that has nothing <span class="t8">topping</span> or <span class="t8">overtopping</span> it; supreme; sovereign.</p>
<p class="p24">I.iii.167 (32,3) as near as the extremest ends/Of parallels] The parallels to which the allusion seems to be made are the parallels on a map. As like as East to West.</p>
<p class="p24">I.iii.179 (32,4)</p>
<p class="p24">All our abilities, gifts, natures, shapes,</p>
<p class="p24">Severals and generals of grace exact,</p>
<p class="p24">Atchievements, plots]</p>
<p class="p24">The meaning is this, All our good <span class="t8">grace exact</span>, means of <span class="t8">excellence irreprehensible</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">I.iii.184 (32,5) to make paradoxes] <span class="t8">Paradoxes</span> may have a meaning, but it is not clear and distinct. I wish the copies had given,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&mdash; to make <span class="t8">parodies</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">I.iii.188 (33,6) bears his head/In such a rein] That is, holds up his head as haughtily. We still say of a girl, <span class="t8">she bridles</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">I.iii.196 (33,7) How rank soever rounded in with danger] A <span class="t8">rank weed</span> is a <span class="t8">high weed</span>. The modern editions silently read,</p>
<p class="p24">How <span class="t8">hard</span> soever &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">I.iii.202 (33,8) and know by measure/Of their observant toil the enemies&rsquo; weight] I think it were better to read,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&mdash; and know <span class="t8">the</span> measure,</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">By</span> their observant toil, <span class="t8">of</span> th&rsquo; enemies&rsquo; weight.</p>
<p class="p24">I.iii.220 (34,1) Achilles&rsquo; arm] So the copies. Perhaps the author wrote,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&mdash; <span class="t8">Alcides&rsquo;</span> arm.</p>
<p class="p24">I.iii.262 (35,4) long continu&rsquo;d truce] Of this long <span class="t8">truce</span> there has been no notice taken; in this very act it is said, that <span class="t8">Ajax coped Hector yesterday in the battle</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">I.iii.270 (36,7) (With truant vows to her own lips he loves)] That is, <span class="t8">confession made with idle vows to the lips of her whom he loves</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">I.iii.319 (37,1) nursery] Alluding to a plantation called a nursery.</p>
<p class="p24">I.iii.341 (38,4) scantling] That is, a <span class="t8">measure</span>, <span class="t8">proportion</span>. The carpenter cuts his wood to a certain <span class="t8">scantling</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">I.iii.343 (38,5) small pricks] Small <span class="t8">points compared</span> with the volumes.</p>
<p class="p24">II.i (40,1) <span class="t8">The Grecian camp. Enter Ajax and Thorsites</span>] ACT II.] This play is not divided into acts in any of the original editions.</p>
<p class="p24">II.i.13 (41,2) The plague of Greece] Alluding perhaps to the plague sent by Apollo on the Grecian army.</p>
<p class="p24">II.i.15 (41,3) Speak then, thou unsalted leaven, speak] [T: unwinnow&rsquo;dst] [W: windyest] Hanmer preserves <span class="t8">whinid&rsquo;st</span>, the reading of the folio; but does not explain it, nor do I understand it. If the folio be followed, I read, <span class="t8">vinew&rsquo;d</span>, that is <span class="t8">mouldy leven</span>. Thou composition of <span class="t8">mustiness</span> and <span class="t8">sourness</span>. &mdash; Theobald&rsquo;s assertion, however confident, is false. <span class="t8">Unsalted</span> leaven is in the old quarto. It means <span class="t8">sour</span> without <span class="t8">salt</span>, malignity without wit. Shakespeare wrote first <span class="t8">unsalted</span>; but recollecting that want of <span class="t8">salt</span> was no fault in leaven, changed it to <span class="t8">vinew&rsquo;d</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">II.i.38 (42,5) aye that thou bark&rsquo;st at him] I read, <span class="t8">O</span> that thou <span class="t8">bark&rsquo;dst</span> at him.</p>
<p class="p24">II.i.42 (42,6) pun thee into shivers] <span class="t8">Pun</span> is in the midland counties the vulgar and colloquial word for <span class="t8">pound</span>. (1773)</p>
<p class="p24">II.i.125 (45,1) when Achilles&rsquo; brach bids me] The folio and quarto read, <span class="t8">Achilles&rsquo;</span> brooch. <span class="t8">Brooch</span> is an appendant ornament. The meaning may be, equivalent to one of <span class="t8">Achilles&rsquo; hangers on</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">II.ii.29 (47,2) The past-proportion of his infinite?] Thus read both the copies. The meaning is, <span class="t8">that greatness, to which no measure bears any proportion</span>. The modern editors silently give,</p>
<p class="p24">The <span class="t8">vast</span> proportion &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">II.ii.58 (48,4) And the will dotes that is inclinable] [Old edition, not so well, has it, <span class="t8">attributive</span>. POPE.] By the old edition Mr. Pope means the old quarto. The folio has, as it stands, <span class="t8">inclinable</span>. &mdash; I think the first reading better; <span class="t8">the will dotes that attributes</span> or gives <span class="t8">the qualities which it affects</span>; that first causes excellence, and then admires it.</p>
<p class="p24">II.ii.60 (48,5) Without some image of the affected merit] The present reading is right. The will <span class="t8">affects</span> an object for some supposed <span class="t8">merit</span>, which Hector says, is uncensurable, unless the <span class="t8">merit</span> so <span class="t8">affected</span> be really there.</p>
<p class="p24">II.ii.71 (48,7) unrespective sieve] That is, into a <span class="t8">common voider</span>. <span class="t8">Sieve</span> is in the quarto. The folio reads,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&mdash; unrespective <span class="t8">fame</span>;</p>
<p class="p24">for which the modern editions have silently printed,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&mdash; unrespective <span class="t8">place</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">II.ii.88 (49,9)</p>
<p class="p24">why do you now</p>
<p class="p24">The issue of your proper wisdoms rate;</p>
<p class="p24">And do a deed that fortune never did,</p>
<p class="p24">Beggar that estimation which you priz&rsquo;d</p>
<p class="p24">Richer than sea and land?]</p>
<p class="p24">If I understand this passage, the meaning is, &ldquo;Why do you, by censuring the determination of your own wisdoms, degrade Helen, whom fortune has not yet deprived of her value, or against whom, as the wife of Paris, fortune has not in this war so declared, as to make us value her less?&rdquo; This is very harsh, and much strained.</p>
<p class="p24">II.ii.122 (50,2) her brain-sick raptures/Cannot distaste the goodness of a quarrel] Corrupt; change to a worse state.</p>
<p class="p24">II.ii.179 (52,3) benummed wills] That is, inflexible, inmoveable, no longer obedient to superior direction.</p>
<p class="p24">II.ii.180 (52,4) There is a law in each well-ordered nation] What the law does in every nation between individuals, justice ought to do between nations.</p>
<p class="p24">II.ii.188 (52,5) Hector&rsquo;s opinion/Is this in way of truth] Though considering <span class="t8">truth</span> and <span class="t8">justice</span> in this question, this is my opinion; yet as a question of honour, I think on it as you.</p>
<p class="p24">II.ii.196 (53,6) the performance of our heaving spleens] The execution of spite and resentment.</p>
<p class="p24">II.ii.212 (53,7) emulation] That is, envy, factious contention.</p>
<p class="p24">II.iii.18 (54,8) without drawing the massy iron and cutting the web] That is, <span class="t8">without drawing their swords to cut the web</span>. They use no means but those of violence.</p>
<p class="p24">II.iii.55 (55,1) decline the whole question] Deduce the question from the first case to the last.</p>
<p class="p24">II.iii.108 (57,6) but it was a strong composure, a fool could disunite] So reads the quarto very properly; but the folio, which the moderns have followed, has, <span class="t8">it was a strong</span> COUNSEL.</p>
<p class="p24">II.iii.118 (57,7) noble state] Person of high dignity; spoken of Agamemnon.</p>
<p class="p24">II.iii.137 (58,8) under-write] To <span class="t8">subscribe</span>, in Shakespeare, is to <span class="t8">obey</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">II.iii.215 (60,2) pheese his pride] To <span class="t8">pheese</span> is to <span class="t8">comb</span> or <span class="t8">curry</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">II.iii.217 (60,3) Not for the worth that hangs upon our quarrel] Not for the value of all for which we are fighting.</p>
<p class="p24">II.iii.267 (62,6)</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Ajax.</span> Shall I call you father?</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Nest.</span> Ay, my good son]</p>
<p class="p24">In the folio and in the nodern editions Ajax desires to give the title of <span class="t8">father</span> to Ulysses; in the quarto, more naturally, to Nestor.</p>
<p class="p24">III.i.35 (64,1) love&rsquo;s invisible soul] <span class="t8">love&rsquo;s</span> visible <span class="t8">soul</span>.] So HANMER. The other editions have <span class="t8">invisible</span>, which perhaps may be right, and may mean the <span class="t8">soul of love</span> invisible every where else.</p>
<p class="p24">III.i.83 (65,3) And, my lord, he desires you] Here I think the speech of Pandarus should begin, and the rest of it should be added to that of Helen, but I have followed the copies.</p>
<p class="p24">III.i.96 (65,4) with my disposer Cressida] [W: dispouser] I do not understand the word <span class="t8">disposer</span>, nor know what to substitute in its place. There is no variation in the copies.</p>
<p class="p24">III.i.132 (67,6) <span class="t8">Yet that which seems the wound to kill</span>] <span class="t8">To kill the wound</span> is no very intelligible expression, nor is the measure preserved. We might read,</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">These lovers cry,</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Oh! oh! they die!</span></p>
<p class="p24">But <span class="t8">that which seems to kill,</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Doth turn</span>, &amp;c.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">So dying love lives still</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">Yet as <span class="t8">the wound to kill</span> may mean <span class="t8">the wound that seems mortal</span>, I alter nothing.</p>
<p class="p24">III.ii.25 (69,1) tun&rsquo;d too sharp in sweetness] &mdash; and <span class="t8">too sharp in sweetness</span>,] So the folio and all modern editions; but the quarto more accurately,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&mdash; <span class="t8">tun&rsquo;d</span> too sharp in sweetness.</p>
<p class="p24">III.ii.99 (71,4) our head shall go bare, &lsquo;till merit crown it] I cannot forbear to observe, that the quarto reads thus: <span class="t8">Our head shall go bare, &lsquo;till merit</span> lower part no affection, <span class="t8">in reversion</span>, &amp;c. Had there been no other copy, hov could this have been corrected? The true reading is in the folio.</p>
<p class="p24">III.ii.102 (72,5) his addition shall be humble] We will give him no high or pompous titles.</p>
<p class="p24">III.ii.162 (74,6)</p>
<p class="p24">but you are wise,</p>
<p class="p24">Or else you love not; to be wise and love,</p>
<p class="p24">Exceeds man&rsquo;s might]</p>
<p class="p24">I read,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&mdash; but <span class="t8">we&rsquo;re not</span> wise,</p>
<p class="p24">Or else <span class="t8">we</span> love not; to be wise and love,</p>
<p class="p24">Exceeds man&rsquo;s might; &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">Cressida, in return to the praise given by Troilus to her wisdom, replies, &ldquo;That lovers are never wise; that it is beyond the power of man to bring love and wisdom to an union.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">III.ii.173 (74,8) Might be affronted with the match] I wish &ldquo;my integrity might be met and matched with such equality and force of pure unmingled love.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">III.ii.184 (75,2) As true as steel, as plantage to the moon] <span class="t8">Plantage</span> is not, I believe, a general term, but the herb which we now call <span class="t8">plantain</span>, in Latin, <span class="t8">plantago</span>, which was, I suppose, imagined to be under the peculiar influence of the moon.</p>
<p class="p24">III.ii.187 (76,3)</p>
<p class="p24">Yet after all comparisons of truth,</p>
<p class="p24">As truth&rsquo;s authentic author to be cited</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">As true as Troilus</span>, shall crown up the verse]</p>
<p class="p24">Troilus shall <span class="t8">crown the verse</span>, as a man <span class="t8">to be cited as the authentic author of truth</span>; as one whose protestations were true to a proverb.</p>
<p class="p24">III.iii.1-16 (77,5) Now, princes, for the service I have done you] I am afraid, that after all the learned commentator&rsquo;s [Warburton&rsquo;s] efforts to clear the argument of Calchas, it will still appear liable to objection; nor do I discover more to be urged in his defence, than that though his skill in divination determined him to leave Troy, jet that he joined himself to Agamemnon and his army by unconstrained good-will; and though he came as a fugitive escaping from destruction, yet his services after his reception, being voluntary and important, deserved reward. This argument is not regularly and distinctly deduced, but this is, I think, the best explication that it will yet admit.</p>
<p class="p24">III.iii.4 (78,6) through the sight I bear in things, to Jove] This passage in all the modern editions is silently depraved, and printed thus:</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&mdash; through the sight I bear in things to come.</p>
<p class="p24">The word is so printed that nothing but the sense can determine whether it be <span class="t8">love</span> or <span class="t8">Jove</span>. I believe that the editors read it as <span class="t8">love</span>, and therefore made the alteration to obtain some meaning.</p>
<p class="p24">III.iii.28 (79,7)</p>
<p class="p24">he shall buy my daughter; and her presence</p>
<p class="p24">Shall quite strike off all service I have done,</p>
<p class="p24">In most accepted pain]</p>
<p class="p24">Sir T. HANMER, and Dr. WARBURTON after him, read,</p>
<p class="p24">In most accepted <span class="t8">pay</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">They do not seem to understand the construction of the passage. <span class="t8">Her presence</span>, says Calchas, shall strike off, or recompence <span class="t8">the service I have done</span>, even in these <span class="t8">labours</span> which were <span class="t8">most accepted</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">III.iii.44 (80,8) derision med&rsquo;cinable] All the modern editions have <span class="t8">decision</span>. The old copies are apparently right. The folio in this place agrees with the quarto, so that the corruption was at first merely accidental.</p>
<p class="p24">III.iii.96 (82,9) how dearly ever parted] I do not think that in the word <span class="t8">parted</span> is included any idea of <span class="t8">division</span>; it means, <span class="t8">however excellently endowed</span>, with however <span class="t8">dear</span> or precious <span class="t8">parts</span> enriched or adorned.</p>
<p class="p24">III.iii.113 (82,2) but the author&rsquo;s drift:/Who, in his circumstance] In the detail or circumduction of his argument.</p>
<p class="p24">III.iii.125 (83,3) The unknovn Ajax] Ajax, who has abilities which were never brought into view or use.</p>
<p class="p24">III.iii.134 (83,4)</p>
<p class="p24">How some men creep in skittish Fortune&rsquo;s hall,</p>
<p class="p24">While others play the idiots in her eyes!]</p>
<p class="p24">To <span class="t8">creep</span> is to <span class="t8">keep out of sight</span> from whatever motive. Some men <span class="t8">keep out of notice in the hall of Fortune</span>, while others, though they but <span class="t8">play the idiot</span>, are always <span class="t8">in her eye</span>, in the way of distinction.</p>
<p class="p24">III.iii.137 (83,5) feasting] Folio. The quarto has <span class="t8">fasting</span>. Either word may bear a good sense.</p>
<p class="p24">III.iii.145 (84,6) Time hath, my lord, a wallet at his back] This speech is printed in all the modern editions with such deviations from the old copy, as exceed the lawful power of an editor.</p>
<p class="p24">III.iii.171 (85,2) for beauty, wit,/High birth, vigour of bone, desert in service] The modern editors read,</p>
<p class="p24">For beauty, wit, high birth, desert in service, &amp;c.</p>
<p class="p24">I do not deny but the changes produce a more easy lapse of numbers, but they do not exhibit the work of Shakespeare, (see 1765, VII, 435, 2)</p>
<p class="p24">III.iii.178 (85,3)</p>
<p class="p24">And shew to dust, that is a little gilt,</p>
<p class="p24">More laud than gilt o&rsquo;er-dusted]</p>
<p class="p24">[T: give to ... laud than they will give to gold] This emendation has been received by the succeeding editors, but recedes too far from the copy. There is no other corruption than such as Shakespeare&rsquo;s incorrectness often resembles. He has omitted the article <span class="t8">to</span> in the second line: he should have written,</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">More laud than</span> to <span class="t8">gilt o&rsquo;er-dusted</span>. (1773) (rev. 1778, IX, 93, 7)</p>
<p class="p24">III.iii.189 (86,4) Made emulous missions] The meaning of <span class="t8">mission</span> seems to be <span class="t8">dispatches</span> of the gods <span class="t8">from heaven</span> about mortal business, such as often happened at the siege of Troy.</p>
<p class="p24">III.iii.197 (86,5) Knows almost every grain of Pluto&rsquo;s gold] For this elegant line the quarto has only,</p>
<p class="p24">Knows almost every <span class="t8">thing</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">III.iii.201 (86,7) (with which relation/Durst never meddle)] There is a secret administration of affairs, which no <span class="t8">history</span> was ever able to discover.</p>
<p class="p24">III.iii.230 (87,9)</p>
<p class="p24">Omission to do what is necessary</p>
<p class="p24">Seals a commission to a blank of danger]</p>
<p class="p24">By <span class="t8">neglecting</span> our duty we <span class="t8">commission</span> or enable that <span class="t8">danger</span> of dishonour, which could not reach us before, to lay hold upon us.</p>
<p class="p24">III.iii.254 (88,1) with a politic regard] With a <span class="t8">sly look</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.i.11 (91,1) During all question of the gentle truce] I once thought to read,</p>
<p class="p24">During all <span class="t8">quiet</span> of the gentle truce.</p>
<p class="p24">But I think <span class="t8">question</span> means intercourse, interchange of conversation.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.i.36 (92,4) His purpose meets you] I bring you his meaning and his orders.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.i.65 (93,6)</p>
<p class="p24">Both merits pois&rsquo;d, each weighs no less nor more,</p>
<p class="p24">But he as he, the heavier for a whore]</p>
<p class="p24">I read,</p>
<p class="p24">But he as he, <span class="t8">each</span> heavier for a whore.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Heavy</span> is taken both for <span class="t8">weighty</span>, and for <span class="t8">sad</span> or <span class="t8">miserable</span>. The quarto reads,</p>
<p class="p24">But he as he, <span class="t8">the</span> heavier for a whore.</p>
<p class="p24">I know not whether the thought is not that of a wager. It must then be read thus:</p>
<p class="p24">But he as he. Which heavier for a whore?</p>
<p class="p24">That is, <span class="t8">for a whore</span> staked down, <span class="t8">which is the heavier</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.i.78 (94,7) We&rsquo;ll not commend what we intend to sell] I believe the meaning is only this: though you practise the buyer&rsquo;s art, we will not practise the seller&rsquo;s. We intend to sell Helen dear, yet will not commend her.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.ii.62 (96,4) My matter is so rash] My business is so <span class="t8">hasty</span> and so abrupt.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.ii.74 (97,6) the secrets of neighbour Pandar] [Pope had emended the Folio&rsquo;s &ldquo;secrets of nature&rdquo; to the present reading] Mr. Pope&rsquo;s reading is in the old quarto. So great is the necessity of collation.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.iv.3 (99,1) The grief] The folio reads,</p>
<p class="p24">The grief is fine, full perfect, that I taste,</p>
<p class="p24">And no less in a sense as strong</p>
<p class="p24">As that which causeth it. &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">The quarto otherwise,</p>
<p class="p24">The grief is fine, full, perfect, that I taste,</p>
<p class="p24">And <span class="t8">violenteth</span> in a sense as strong</p>
<p class="p24">As that which causeth it. &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Violenteth</span> is a word with which I am not acquainted, yet perhaps it may be right. The reading of the text is without authority.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.iv.65 (101,3) For I will throw my glove to death] That is, I will <span class="t8">challenge</span> death himself in defence of thy fidelity.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.iv.105 (103,5)</p>
<p class="p24">While others fish, with craft, for great opinion,</p>
<p class="p24">I, with great truth, catch mere simplicity.]</p>
<p class="p24">The meaning, I think, is, <span class="t8">while others</span>, by their art, gain high estimation, I, by honesty, obtain a plain simple approbation.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.iv.109 (103,6) the moral of my wit/Is, <span class="t8">plain and true</span>] That is, the <span class="t8">governing principle of my understanding</span>; but I rather think we should read,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&mdash; the <span class="t8">motto</span> of my wit</p>
<p class="p24">Is, plain and true, &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">IV.iv.114 (103,7) possess thee what she is] I will <span class="t8">make thee fully understand</span>. This sense of the word <span class="t8">possess</span> is frequent in our author.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.iv.134 (104,9) I&rsquo;ll answer to my list] This, I think, is right, though both the old copies read <span class="t8">lust</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.v.8 (105,1) bias cheek] Swelling out like the bias of a bowl.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.v.37 (106,3) I&rsquo;ll make my match to live./The kiss you take is better than you give] I will make such <span class="t8">bargains</span> as I may live by, <span class="t8">such as may bring me profit</span>, therefore will not take a worse kiss than I give.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.v.48 (107,4) Why, beg then] For the sake of rhime we should read,</p>
<p class="p24">Why beg <span class="t8">two</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">If you think kisses worth begging, beg more than one.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.v.52 (107,5) Never&rsquo;s my day, and then a kiss of you] I once gave both these lines to Cressida. She bids Ulysses beg a kiss; he asks that he may have it,</p>
<p class="p24">When Helen is a maid again &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">She tells him that then he shall have it:</p>
<p class="p24">When Helen is a maid again &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Cre.</span> I am your debtor, claim it when &rsquo;tis due;</p>
<p class="p24">Never&rsquo;s my day, and then a kiss <span class="t8">for</span> you.</p>
<p class="p24">But I rather think that Ulysses means to slight her, and that the present reading is right.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.v.57 (107,6) motive of her body] <span class="t8">Motive</span> for <span class="t8">part that contributes to motion</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.v.59 (107,7) a coasting] An amorous address; courtship.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.v.62 (107,8) sluttish spoils of opportunity] Corrupt wenches, of whose chastity every opportunity may make a prey.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.v.73 (108,9) <span class="t8">Aga.</span> &rsquo;Tis done like Hector, but securely done] [Theobald gave the speech to Achilles] As the old copies agree, I have made no change.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.v.79 (108,1) Valour and pride excel themselves in Hector] Shakespeare&rsquo;s thought is not exactly deduced. Nicety of expression is not his character. The cleaning is plain, &ldquo;Valour (says AEneas) is in Hector greater than valour in other men, and pride in Hector is less than pride in other men. So that Hector is distinguished by the excellence of having pride less than other pride, and valour more than other valour.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">IV.v.103 (109,2) an impair thought] A thought suitable to the dignity of his character. This word I should have changed to <span class="t8">impure</span>, were I not over-powered by the unanimity of the editors, and concurrence of the old copies, (rev. 1778, IX, 120, 8)</p>
<p class="p24">IV.v.105 (109,3) Hector in his blaze of wrath subscribes/To tender objects] That is, <span class="t8">yields, gives</span> way.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.v.112 (110,4) thus translate him to me] Thus <span class="t8">explain his character</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.v.142 (111,5) <span class="t8">Hect.</span> Not Neoptolemus so mirable] [W: Neoptolemus&rsquo;s sire irascible] After all this contention it is difficult to imagine that the critic believes <span class="t8">mirable</span> to have been changed to <span class="t8">irascible</span>. I should sooner read,</p>
<p class="p24">Not Neoptolemus th&rsquo; admirable;</p>
<p class="p24">as I know not whether <span class="t8">mirable</span> can be found in any other place. The correction which the learned commentator gave to Hanmer,</p>
<p class="p24">Not Neoptolemus&rsquo; <span class="t8">sire</span> so mirable,</p>
<p class="p24">as it was modester than this, was preferable to it. But nothing is more remote from justness of sentiment, than for Hector to characterise Achilles as the father of Neoptolemus, a youth that had not yet appeared in arms, and whose name was therefore much less knovn than his father&rsquo;s. My opinion is, that by Neoptolemus the author meant Achilles himself; and remembering that the son was Pyrrhus Neoptolemus, considered Neoptolemus as the nomen gentilitium, and thought the father was likewise Achilles Neoptolemus.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.v.147 (112,6) We&rsquo;ll answer it] That is, answer the <span class="t8">expectance</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.v.275 (117,5) Beat loud the tabourines] For this the quarto and the latter editions have,</p>
<p class="p24">To taste your bounties. &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">The reading which I have given from the folio seems chosen at the revision, to avoid the repetition of the word <span class="t8">bounties</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">V.i.5 (118,1) Thou crusty batch of nature] <span class="t8">Batch</span> is changed by Theobald to <span class="t8">botch</span>, and the change is justified by a pompous note, which discovers that he did not know the word <span class="t8">batch</span>. What is more strange, Hanmer has followed him. <span class="t8">Batch</span> is any thing <span class="t8">baked</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">V.i.19 (119,3) Male-varlet] HANMER reads <span class="t8">male-harlot</span>, plausibly enough, except that it seems too plain to require the explanation which Patroclus demands.</p>
<p class="p24">V.i.23 (119,4) cold palsies] This catalogue of loathsome maladies ends in the folio at <span class="t8">cold palsies</span>. This passage, as it stands, is in the quarto: the retrenchment was in my opinion judicious. It may be remarked, though it proves nothing, that, of the few alterations made by Milton in the second edition of his wonderful poem, one was, an enlargement of the enumeration of diseases.</p>
<p class="p24">V.i.32 (119,5) you ruinous butt; you whoreson indistinguishable cur] Patroclos reproaches Thersites with deformity, with having one part crowded into another.</p>
<p class="p24">V.i.35 (119,6) thou idle immaterial skeyn of sley&rsquo;d silk] All the terms used by Thersites of Patroclus, are emblematically expressive of flexibility, compliance, and mean officiousness.</p>
<p class="p24">V.i.40 (119,7) Out, gall!] HANMER reads <span class="t8">nut-gall</span>, which answers well enough to <span class="t8">finch-egg</span>; it has already appeared, that our author thought the <span class="t8">nut-gall</span> the bitter gall. He is called <span class="t8">nut</span>, from the conglobation of his form; but both the copies read, <span class="t8">Out, gall</span>!</p>
<p class="p24">V.i.41 (120,8) Finch egg!] Of this reproach I do not know the exact meaning. I suppose he means to call him <span class="t8">singing bird</span>, as implying an useless favourite, and yet more, something more worthless, a singing bird in the egg, or generally, a slight thing easily crushed.</p>
<p class="p24">V.i.64 (121,2) forced with wit] Stuffed with wit. A term of cookery. &mdash; In this speech I do not well understand what is meant by <span class="t8">loving quails</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">V.i.73 (121,3) spirits and fires!] This Thersites speaks upon the first sight of the distant lights.</p>
<p class="p24">V.ii.11 (124,1) And any man may sing her, if he can take her cliff] That is, her <span class="t8">key</span>. <span class="t8">Clef</span>, French.</p>
<p class="p24">V.ii.41 (125,2) You flow to great distraction] So the moderns. The folio has,</p>
<p class="p24">You <span class="t8">flow</span> to great <span class="t8">distraction</span>. &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">The quarto,</p>
<p class="p24">You <span class="t8">flow</span> to great <span class="t8">destruction</span>. &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">I read,</p>
<p class="p24">You <span class="t8">show too</span> great distraction. &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">V.ii.108 (128,7) But with my heart the other eye doth see] I think it should be read thus,</p>
<p class="p24">But <span class="t8">my heart with</span> the other eye doth see.</p>
<p class="p24">V.ii.113 (128,8) A proof of strength she could not publish more] She could not publish a stronger proof.</p>
<p class="p24">V.ii.125 (129,1) I cannot conjure, Trojan] That is, I cannot raise spirits in the form of Cressida.</p>
<p class="p24">V.ii.141 (129,2) If there be rule in unity itself] I do not well understand what is meant by <span class="t8">rule in unity</span>. By <span class="t8">rule</span> our author, in this place as in others, intends <span class="t8">virtuous restraint, regularity of manners, command of passions and appetites</span>. In Macbeth,</p>
<p class="p24">He cannot buckle his distemper&rsquo;d cause</p>
<p class="p24">Within the belt of rule. &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">But I know not how to apply the word in this sense to <span class="t8">unity</span>. I read,</p>
<p class="p24">If there be rule in <span class="t8">purity</span> itself,</p>
<p class="p24">Or, If there be rule in <span class="t8">verity</span> itself.</p>
<p class="p24">Such alterations would not offend the reader, who saw the state of the old editions, in which, for instance, a few lines lower, <span class="t8">the almighty sun</span> is called <span class="t8">the almighty fenne</span>. &mdash; Yet the words may at last mean, If there be <span class="t8">certainty</span> in <span class="t8">unity</span>, if it be a <span class="t8">rule</span> that <span class="t8">one is one</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">V.ii.144 (130,3) Bi-fold authority!] This is the reading of the quarto. The folio gives us,</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">By foul</span> authority! &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">There is <span class="t8">madness</span> in that disquisition in which a man reasons at once <span class="t8">for</span> and <span class="t8">against himself upon authority</span> which he knows <span class="t8">not to be valid</span>. The quarto is right.</p>
<p class="p24">V.ii.144 (130,4)</p>
<p class="p24">where reason can revolt</p>
<p class="p24">Without perdition, and loss assume all reason</p>
<p class="p24">Without revolt]</p>
<p class="p24">The words <span class="t8">loss</span> and <span class="t8">perdition</span> are used in their common sense, but they mean the <span class="t8">loss</span> or <span class="t8">perdition</span> of <span class="t8">reason</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">V.ii.157 (131,6) And with another knot five-finger-tied] A knot tied by giving her hand to Diomed.</p>
<p class="p24">V.ii.160 (131,7) o&rsquo;er-eaten faith] Vows which she has already swallowed <span class="t8">once over</span>. We still say of a faithless man, that he has <span class="t8">eaten his words</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">V.ii.161 (131,8)</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Ulyss.</span> May worthy Troilus be half attach&rsquo;d</p>
<p class="p24">With that which here his passion doth express!]</p>
<p class="p24">Can Troilus really feel on this occasion half of what he utters? A question suitable to the calm Ulysses.</p>
<p class="p24">V.iii.21 (133,2)</p>
<p class="p24">For us to count we give what&rsquo;s gain&rsquo;d by thefts,</p>
<p class="p24">And rob in the behalf of charity]</p>
<p class="p24">This is so oddly confused in the folio, that I transcribe it as a specimen of incorrectness:</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&mdash; do not count it holy,</p>
<p class="p24">To hurt by being just; it were as lawful</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">For we would count give much to as violent thefts</span>,</p>
<p class="p24">And rob in the behalf of charity.</p>
<p class="p24">V.iii.23 (133,3)</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Cas.</span> It is the purpose that makes strong the vow;</p>
<p class="p24">But vows to every purpose must not hold]</p>
<p class="p24">The mad prophetess speaks here with all the coolness and judgment of a skilful casuist. &ldquo;The essence of a lawful vow, is a lawful purpose, and the vow of which the end is wrong must not be regarded as cogent.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">V.iii.27 (134,4)</p>
<p class="p24">Life every man holds dear; but the dear man</p>
<p class="p24">Holds honour far more precious dear than life]</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Valuable</span> man. The modern editions read,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&mdash; <span class="t8">brave</span> man.</p>
<p class="p24">The repetition of the word is in our author&rsquo;s manner.</p>
<p class="p24">V.iii.37 (134,5)</p>
<p class="p24">Brother, you have a vice of mercy in you,</p>
<p class="p24">Which better fits a lion, than a man]</p>
<p class="p24">The traditions and stories of the darker ages abounded with examples of the lion&rsquo;s generosity. Upon the supposition that these acts of clemency were true, Troilus reasons not improperly, that to spare against reason, by mere instinct of pity, became rather a generous beast than a wise man.</p>
<p class="p24">V.x.33 (137,9) Hence, broker lacquey!] For <span class="t8">brothel</span>, the folio reads <span class="t8">brother</span>, erroneously for <span class="t8">broker</span>, as it stands at the end of the play where the lines are repeated. Of <span class="t8">brother</span> the following editors made <span class="t8">brothel</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">V.iv.18 (138,2) the Grecians begin to proclaim barbarism, and policy grows into an ill opinion] To set up the authority of ignorance to declare that they will be governed by policy no longer.</p>
<p class="p24">V.vi.11 (142,1) you cogging Greeks] This epithet has no particular propriety in this place, but the author had heard of <span class="t8">Graecia Mendax</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">V.vi.29 (144,3) I&rsquo;ll frush it] The word <span class="t8">frush</span> I never found elsewhere, nor understand it. HANMER explains it, to <span class="t8">break</span> or <span class="t8">bruise</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">V.viii.7 (146,1) Even with the vail and darkening of the sun] The <span class="t8">vail</span> is, I think, the <span class="t8">sinking</span> of the sun; not <span class="t8">veil</span> or <span class="t8">cover</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">(149) General Observation. This play is more correctly written than most of Shakespeare&rsquo;s compositions, but it is not one of those in which either the extent of his views or elevation of his fancy is fully displayed. As the story abounded with materials, he has exerted little invention; but he has diversified his characters with great variety, and preserved them with great exactness. His vicious characters sometimes disgust, but cannot corrupt, for both Cressida and Pandarus are detested and contemned. The comic characters seem to have been the favourites of the writer; they are of the superficial kind, and exhibit more of manners than nature; but they are copiously filled and powerfully impressed. Shakespeare has in his story followed, for the greater part, the old book of Caxton, which was then very popular; but the character of Thersites, of which it makes no mention, is a proof that this play was written after Chapman had published his version of <span class="t8">Homer</span>.</p>
