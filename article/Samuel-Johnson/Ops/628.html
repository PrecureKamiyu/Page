<p class="p21">Is in English considered both as a vowel and consonant; though, since the vowel and consonant differ in their form as well as sound, they may be more properly accounted two letters.</p>
<p class="p32"><span class="t8">I</span> vowel has a long sound, as <span class="t8">fine, thine</span>, which is usually marked by an <span class="t8">e</span> final; and a short sound, as <span class="t8">fin, thin.</span> Prefixed to <span class="t8">e</span> it makes a diphthong of the same sound with the soft <span class="t8">i</span>, or double <span class="t8">e, ee</span>: thus <span class="t8">field, yield</span>, are spoken as <span class="t8">feeld, yeeld</span>; except <span class="t8">friend</span>, which is spoken <span class="t8">frend</span>. Subjoined to <span class="t8">a</span> or <span class="t8">e</span> it makes them long, as <span class="t8">fail, neigh</span>; and to <span class="t8">o</span> makes a mingled sound, which approaches more nearly to the true notion of a diphthong, or sound composed of the sounds of two vowels, than any other combination of vowels in the English tongue, as <span class="t8">oil, coin</span>. The sound of <span class="t8">i</span> before another <span class="t8">i</span>, and at the end of a word, is always expressed by <span class="t8">y</span>.</p>
<p class="p32"><span class="t8">J</span> consonant has invariably the same sound with that of <span class="t8">g</span> in <span class="t8">giant</span>; as <span class="t8">jade, jet, jilt, jolt, just.</span></p>
