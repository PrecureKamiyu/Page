One approach to mapping the database to ﬁles is to use several ﬁles, and to store records of only one ﬁxed length in any given ﬁle. An alternative is to structure ﬁles so that they can accommodate multiple lengths for records. The slotted-page method is widely used to handle varying-length records within a disk block.</span></p><p class="s39" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 139pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: justify;">• <span class="s40">Since data are transferred between disk storage and main memory in units of a block, it is worthwhile to assign ﬁle records to blocks in such a way that a single block contains related records. If we can access several of the records we want with only one block access, we save disk accesses. Since disk accesses are usually the bottleneck in the performance of a database system, careful assignment of records to blocks can pay signiﬁcant performance dividends.</span></p><p class="s39" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 139pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: justify;">• <span class="s40">The data dictionary, also referred to as the system catalog, keeps track of metadata, that is, data about data, such as relation names, attribute names and types, storage information, integrity constraints, and user information.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s13" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 107pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s39">• </span><span class="s40">One way to reduce the number of disk accesses is to keep as many blocks as pos- sible in main memory. Since it is not possible to keep all blocks in main memory, we need to manage the allocation of the space available in main memory for the storage of blocks. The </span>buﬀer <span class="p">is that part of main memory available for storage of copies of disk blocks. The subsystem responsible for the allocation of buﬀer space is called the </span>buﬀer manager<span class="p">.</span></p><p class="s39" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 107pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: justify;">• <span class="s40">Column-oriented storage systems provide good performance for many data ware- housing applications.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part252.htm">&lt; 上一个</a><span> | </span><a href="../database.html">内容</a><span> | </span><a href="part254.htm">下一个 &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
