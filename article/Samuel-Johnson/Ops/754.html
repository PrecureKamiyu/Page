<h2 class="h20"><a id="a1839"></a><a id="a1838"></a>THE COMEDY OF ERRORS</h2>
<p class="p21">I.ii.96 (155,3) [o&rsquo;er-raught] That is, <span class="t8">over-reached</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">I.ii.98 (156,5)</p>
<p class="p26">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[As, nimble jugglers, that deceive the eye,<br/>Dark-working sorcerers, that change the mind,<br/>Soul-killing witches, that deform the body]</p>
<p class="p24">[W: Drug-working] The learned commentator has endeavoured with much earnestness to recommend his alteration; but, if I may judge of other apprehensions by my own, without great success. This interpretation of <span class="t8">soul-killing</span> is forced and harsh. Sir T. Hammer reads <span class="t8">soul-selling</span>, agreeable enough to the common opinion, but without such improvement as may justify the change. Perhaps the epithets have only been misplaced, and the lines should be read thus,</p>
<p class="p26">&nbsp;Soul-killing <span class="t8">sorcerers, that change the mind</span>;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Dark-working <span class="t8">witches that deform the body</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">This change seems to remove all difficulties.</p>
<p class="p24">By <span class="t8">soul-killing</span> I understand destroying the rational faculties by such means as make men fancy themselves beasts.</p>
<p class="p24">I.ii.102 (157,6) [liberties of sin] Sir T. Hammer reads, <span class="t8">libertines</span>, which, as the author has been enumerating not acts but persons, seems right.</p>
<p class="p24">II.i.30 (158,8) [How if your husband start some other where?] I cannot but think, that our authour wrote,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&mdash; <span class="t8">start some other</span> hare?</p>
<p class="p24">So in <span class="t8">Much ado about Nothing</span>, Cupid is said to be <span class="t8">a good hare-finder</span>. II.i.32 (159,9) [tho&rsquo; she pause] To <span class="t8">pause</span> is to rest, to be in quiet.</p>
<p class="p24">II.i.41 (159,1) [fool-begg&rsquo;d] She seems to mean, by <span class="t8">fool-begg&rsquo;d patience</span>, that patience which is so near to <span class="t8">idiotical simplicity</span>, that your next relation would take advantage from it to represent you as a <span class="t8">fool</span>, and <span class="t8">beg</span> the guardianship of your fortune.</p>
<p class="p24">II.i.82 (161,3) [Am I so round with you, as you with me] He plays upon the word <span class="t8">round</span>, which signified <span class="t8">spherical</span> applied to himself, and <span class="t8">unrestrained</span>, or <span class="t8">free in speech</span> or <span class="t8">action</span>, spoken of his mistress. So the king, in <span class="t8">Hamlet</span>, bids the queen be <span class="t8">round</span> with her son.</p>
<p class="p24">II.i.100 (161,5) [too unruly deer] The ambiguity of <span class="t8">deer</span> and <span class="t8">dear</span> is borrowed, poor as it is, by Waller, in his poem on the <span class="t8">Ladies Girdle</span>.</p>
<p class="p26">&nbsp;&rdquo;This was my heav&rsquo;n&rsquo;s extremest sphere,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&rdquo;This pale that held my lovely deer.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">II.i.101 (161,6) [poor I am but his stale] The word <span class="t8">stale</span>, in our authour, used as a substantive, means, not something offered to <span class="t8">allure</span> or <span class="t8">attract</span>, but something <span class="t8">vitiated</span> with <span class="t8">use</span>, something of which the best part has been enjoyed and consumed.</p>
<p class="p24">II.ii.86 (166,4) [Not a man of those, but he hath the wit to lose his hair] That is, <span class="t8">Those who have more hair than wit</span>, are easily entrapped by loose women, and suffer the consequences of lewdness, one of which, in the first appearance of the disease in Europe, was the loss of hair.</p>
<p class="p24">II.ii.173 (169,6) [Be it my wrong, you are from me exempt] Exempt, separated, parted. The sense is, <span class="t8">If I am doomed to suffer the wrong of separation, yet injure not with contempt me who am already injured</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">II.ii.210 (171,1) [And shrive you] That is, I will <span class="t8">call you to confession</span>, and make you tell your tricks.</p>
<p class="p24">III.i.4 (172,2) [carkanet] seems to have been a necklace or rather chain, perhaps hanging down double from the neck. So Lovelace in his poem,</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">The empress spreads her</span> carcanets.</p>
<p class="p24">III.i.15 (173,3) [Marry, so it doth appear By the wrongs I suffer, and the blows I bear] [T: don&rsquo;t appear] I do not think this emendation necessary. He first says, that his <span class="t8">wrongs</span> and <span class="t8">blows</span> prove him an <span class="t8">ass</span>; but immediately, with a correction of his former sentiment, such as may be hourly observed in conversation, he observes that, if he had been an ass, he should, when he was <span class="t8">kicked</span>, have <span class="t8">kicked</span> again.</p>
<p class="p24">III.i.101 (177,7) [supposed by the common rout] For <span class="t8">suppose</span> I once thought it might be more commodious to substitute <span class="t8">supported</span>; but there is no need of change: <span class="t8">supposed</span> is <span class="t8">founded on supposition</span>, made by conjecture.</p>
<p class="p24">III.i.105 (178,8) [For slander lives upon succession] The line apparently wants two syllables: what they were, cannot now be known. The line may be filled up according to the reader&rsquo;s fancy, as thus:</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">For</span> lasting <span class="t8">slander lives upon succession</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">III.ii.27 (180,3) [&rsquo;Tis holy sport to be a little vain] is <span class="t8">light of tongue, not veracious</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">III.ii.64 (181,2) [My sole earth&rsquo;s heaven, and my heaven&rsquo;s claim] When be calls the girl his <span class="t8">only heaven on the earth</span>, he utters the common cant of lovers. When he calls her <span class="t8">his heaven&rsquo;s claim</span>, I cannot understand him. Perhaps he means that which he asks of heaven.</p>
<p class="p24">III.ii.125 (184,5)</p>
<p class="p24">[<span class="t8">S. Ant.</span> Where France? <span class="t8">S. Dro.</span> In her forehead; arm&rsquo;d and reverted, making war against her hair]</p>
<p class="p24">[T, from the first Folio: heir] With this correction and explication Dr. Warburton concurs, and sir T. Hammer thinks an equivocation intended, though he retains <span class="t8">hair</span> in the text. Yet surely they have all lost the sense by looking beyond it. Our authour, in my opinion, only sports with an allusion, in which he takes too much delight, and means that his mistress had the French disease. The ideas are rather too offensive to be dilated. By a forehead <span class="t8">armed</span>, he means covered with incrusted eruptions: by reverted, he means having the hair turning backwards. An equivocal word must have senses applicable to both the subjects to which it is applied. Both <span class="t8">forehead</span> and <span class="t8">France</span> might in some sort make war against their <span class="t8">hair</span>, but how did the <span class="t8">forehead</span> make war against its <span class="t8">heir</span>? The sense which I have given immediately occurred to me, and will, I believe, arise to every reader who is contented with the meaning that lies before him, without sending out conjecture in search of refinements.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.ii.19 (192,9) [sere] that is, <span class="t8">dry</span>, withered.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.ii.22 (192,1) [Stigmatical in making] This is, <span class="t8">marked</span> or <span class="t8">stigmatized</span> by nature with deformity, as a token of his vicious disposition.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.ii.35 (193,3) [A fiend, a fairy, pitiless and rough] [T: A fiend, a fury] There were fairies like <span class="t8">hobgoblins</span>, pitiless and rough, and described as malevolent and mischievous, (see 1765, III,143,3)</p>
<p class="p24">IV.ii.39 (193,5) [A hound that runs counter, and yet draws dry-foot well] To <span class="t8">run counter</span> is to <span class="t8">run backward</span>, by mistaking the course of the animal pursued; to <span class="t8">draw dry-foot</span> is, I believe, to pursue by the <span class="t8">track</span> or <span class="t8">prick of the foot</span>; to <span class="t8">run counter</span> and <span class="t8">draw dry-foot well are</span>, therefore, inconsistent. The jest consists in the ambiguity of the word <span class="t8">counter</span>, which means the <span class="t8">wrong way in</span>* <span class="t8">the chase.</span> and a <span class="t8">prison</span> in London. The officer that arrested him was a serjeant of the counter. For the congruity of this jest with the scene of action, let our authour answer.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.iii.13 (196,9) [what, have you got the picture of old Adam new apparel&rsquo;d] [T: got rid of the picture] The explanation is very good, but the text does not require to be amended.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.iii.27 (`is rest to do more exploits with his mace than a morris pike] [W: a Maurice-pike] This conjecture is very ingenious, yet the commentator talks unnecessarily of the <span class="t8">rest of a musket.</span> by which he makes the hero of the speech set up the <span class="t8">rest</span> of a <span class="t8">musket,</span> to do exploits with a <span class="t8">pike.</span> The rest of a <span class="t8">pike</span> was a common term, and signified, I believe, the manner in which it was fixed to receive the rush of the enemy. A <span class="t8">morris-pike</span> was a pike used in a morris or a military dance, and with which great <span class="t8">exploits</span> were <span class="t8">done,</span> that is, great feats of dexterity were shewn. There is no need of change.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.iv.78 (202,3) [kitchen-vestal] Her charge being like that of the vestal virgins, to keep the fire burning.</p>
<p class="p24">V.1.137 (210,6) [important letters]<span class="t8">Important</span> seems to be for <span class="t8">importunate.</span> (1773)</p>
<p class="p24">V.i.298 (216,2) [time&rsquo;s deformed hand Have written strange defeatures in my face] <span class="t8">Defeature</span> is the privative of <span class="t8">feature.</span> The meaning is, time hath cancelled my features.</p>
<p class="p24">V.i.406 (220,7) [After so long grief such nativity!] We should surely read. <span class="t8">After so long grief, such</span> festivity.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Nativity</span> lying so near, and the termination being the same of both words, the mistake was easy.</p>
