<p class="p21">Persons Represented: Varrius might be omitted, for he is only once spoken to, and says nothing.</p>
<p class="p24">There it perhaps not one of Shakespeare&rsquo;s plays more darkened than this by the peculiarities of its authour, and the unskilfulness of its editors, by distortions of phrase, or negligence of transcription.</p>
<p class="p24">I.i.6 (4,4) [lists] Bounds, limits.</p>
<p class="p26">I.i.7 (4,5) [Then no more remains,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But that your sufficiency, as your worth is able,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And let them work]</p>
<p class="p24">This is a passage which has exercised the sagacity of the editors, and is now to employ mine. [Johnson adds T&rsquo;s and W&rsquo;s notes] Sir Tho. Hammer, having caught from Mr. Theobald a hint that a line was lost, endeavours to supply it thus.</p>
<p class="p26">&nbsp;&mdash; <span class="t8">Then no more remains,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;But that to your sufficiency</span> you join<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;A will to serve us, <span class="t8">as your worth is able</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">He has by this bold conjecture undoubtedly obtained a meaning, but, perhaps not, even in his own opinion, the meaning of Shakespeare.</p>
<p class="p24">That the passage is more or less corrupt, I believe every reader will agree with the editors. I am not convinced that a line is lost, as Mr. Theobald conjectures, nor that the change of <span class="t8">but</span> to <span class="t8">put</span>, which Dr. Warburton has admitted after some other editor, will amend the fault. There was probably some original obscurity in the expression, which gave occasion to mistake in repetition or transcription. I therefore suspect that the authour wrote thus,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&mdash; <span class="t8">Then no more remains. But that to your</span> sufficiencies <span class="t8">your worth is</span> abled, And let them work.</p>
<p class="p24">Then nothing remains more than to tell you, that your virtue is now invested with power equal to your knowledge and wisdom. Let therefore your knowledge and your virtue now work together. It may easily be conceived how <span class="t8">sufficiencies</span> was, by an inarticulate speaker, or inattentive hearer, confounded with <span class="t8">sufficiency as</span>, and how <span class="t8">abled</span>, a word very unusual, was changed into <span class="t8">able</span>. For <span class="t8">abled</span>, however, an authority is not wanting. Lear uses it in the same sense, or nearly the same, with the Duke. As for <span class="t8">sufficiencies</span>, D. Hamilton, in his dying speech, prays that Charles II. <span class="t8">may exceed both the</span> virtues <span class="t8">and</span> sufficiencies <span class="t8">of his father</span>.</p>
<p class="p26">I.i.11 (6,6) [the terms For common justice, you are as pregnant in]<br/>The later editions all give it, without authority,</p>
<p class="p26">&nbsp;&mdash; <span class="t8">the terms</span><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of <span class="t8">justice</span>, &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">and Dr. Warburton makes <span class="t8">terms</span> signify <span class="t8">bounds</span> or <span class="t8">limits</span>. I rather think the Duke meant to say, that Escalus was <span class="t8">pregnant</span>, that is, <span class="t8">ready</span> and knowing in all the forms of law, and, among other things, in the <span class="t8">terms</span> or <span class="t8">times set apart</span> for its administration.</p>
<p class="p24">I.i.18 (7,7) [we have with special soul Elected him our absence to supply] [W: roll] This editor is, I think, right in supposing a corruption, but less happy in his emendation. I read,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&mdash; <span class="t8">we have with special</span> seal <span class="t8">Elected him our absence to supply</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">A special <span class="t8">seal</span> is a very natural metonymy for a special <span class="t8">commission</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">I.i.28 (8,8)</p>
<p class="p26">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[There is a kind of character in thy life,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That to the observer doth thy history<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fully unfold]</p>
<p class="p24">Either this introduction has more solemnity than meaning, or it has a meaning which I cannot discover. What is there peculiar in this, that a man&rsquo;s <span class="t8">life</span> informs the observer of his <span class="t8">history</span>? Might it be supposed that Shakespeare wrote this?</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">There is a kind of character in thy</span> look.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">History</span> may be taken in a more diffuse and licentious meaning, for <span class="t8">future occurrences</span>, or the part of life yet to come. If this sense be received, the passage is clear and proper.</p>
<p class="p24">I.i.37 (8,1) [to fine issues] To great consequences. For high purposes.</p>
<p class="p24">I.i.41 (9,2) [But I do bend my speech To one that can my part in him advertise] I know not whether we may not better read,</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">One that can my part</span> to <span class="t8">him advertise</span>,</p>
<p class="p24">One that can <span class="t8">inform himself</span> of that which it would be otherwise <span class="t8">my part</span> to tell him.</p>
<p class="p26">I.i.43 (9,3) [Hold therefore, Angelo] That is, continue to be<br/>Angelo; <span class="t8">hold</span> as thou art.</p>
<p class="p24">I.i.47 (9,4) [first in question] That is, first called for; first appointed.</p>
<p class="p24">I.i.52 (9,5) [We have with a leaven&rsquo;d and prepared choice Proceeded to you] [W: a levell&rsquo;d] No emendation is necessary. <span class="t8">Leaven&rsquo;d</span> choice is one of Shakespeare&rsquo;s harsh metaphors. His train of ideas seems to be this. <span class="t8">I have proceeded to you with choice</span> mature, concocted, fermented, <span class="t8">leavened</span>. When bread is <span class="t8">leavened</span> it is left to ferment: a <span class="t8">leavened</span> choice is therefore a choice not hasty, but considerate, not declared as soon as it fell into the imagination, but suffered to work long in the mind. Thus explained, it suits better with <span class="t8">prepared</span> than <span class="t8">levelled</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">I.i.65 (10,6) [your scope is as mine own] That is, Your amplitude of power.</p>
<p class="p24">I.ii.22 (12,7) [in metre?] In the primers, there are metrical graces, such as, I suppose, were used in Shakespeare&rsquo;s time.</p>
<p class="p24">I.ii.25 (12,9) [Grace is grace, despight of all controversy] [Warbarton had suspected an allusion to ecclesiastical disputes.] I am in doubt whether Shakespeare&rsquo;s thoughts reached so far into ecclesiastical disputes. Every commentator is warped a little by the tract of his own profession. The question is, whether the second gentleman has ever heard grace. The first gentleman limits the question to <span class="t8">grace in metre</span>. Lucio enlarges it to <span class="t8">grace in any</span> form <span class="t8">or language</span>. The first gentleman, to go beyond him, says, or <span class="t8">in any religion</span>, which Lucio allows, because the nature of things is unalterable; grace is as immutably grace, as his merry antagonist is a <span class="t8">wicked villain</span>. Difference in religion cannot make a <span class="t8">grace</span> not to be <span class="t8">grace</span>, a <span class="t8">prayer</span> not to be <span class="t8">holy</span>; as nothing can make a <span class="t8">villain</span> not to be a <span class="t8">villain</span>. This seems to be the meaning, such as it is.</p>
<p class="p24">I.ii.28 (12,1) [there went but a pair of sheers between us] We are both of the same piece.</p>
<p class="p24">I.ii.35 (13,2) [be pil&rsquo;d, as thou art pil&rsquo;d, for a French velvet?] The jest about the pile of a French velvet alludes to the loss of hair in the French disease, a very frequent topick of our authour&rsquo;s jocularity. Lucio finding that the gentleman understands the distemper so well, and mentions it so <span class="t8">feelingly</span>, promises to remember to drink his <span class="t8">health</span>, but to forget <span class="t8">to drink after him</span>. It was the opinion of Shakespeare&rsquo;s time, that the cup of an infected person was contagious.</p>
<p class="p24">I.ii.50 (13,3) [To three thousand dollars a year] [A quibble intended between <span class="t8">dollars</span> and <span class="t8">dolours</span>. Hammer.] The same jest occured before in the <span class="t8">Tempest</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">I.ii.83 (15,5) [what with the sweat] This nay allude to the <span class="t8">sweating sickness</span>, of which the memory was very fresh in the time of Shakespeare: but more probably to the method of cure then used for the diseases contracted in brothels.</p>
<p class="p24">I.ii.124 (16,6)</p>
<p class="p26">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Thus can the demi-god, Authority,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make us pay down, for our offence, by weight. &mdash; <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The words of heaven; &mdash; on whom it will, it will;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On whom it will not, so; yet still &rsquo;tis just]</p>
<p class="p24">[Warburton had emended the punctuation of the second line] I suspect that a line is lost.</p>
<p class="p24">I.ii.162 (18,8) [the fault, and glimpse, of newness] <span class="t8">Fault</span> and <span class="t8">glimpse</span> have so little relation to each other, that both can scarcely be right: we may read <span class="t8">flash</span> for <span class="t8">fault</span> or, perhaps we may read,</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Whether it be the fault</span> or <span class="t8">glimpse</span> &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">That is, whether it be the seeming enormity of the action, or the glare of new authority. Yet the sane sense follows in the next lines, (see 1765, I, 275, 4)</p>
<p class="p24">I.ii.188 (19,2) [There is a prone and speechless dialect] I can scarcely tell what signification to give to the word <span class="t8">prone</span>. Its primitive and translated senses are well known. The authour may, by a <span class="t8">prone</span> dialect, mean a dialect which men are <span class="t8">prone</span> to regard, or a dialect natural and unforced, as those actions seem to which we are <span class="t8">prone</span>. Either of these interpretations are sufficiently strained; but such distortion of words is not uncommon in our authour. For the sake of an easier sense, we may read,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&mdash; <span class="t8">In her youth There is a</span> pow&rsquo;r, <span class="t8">and speechless dialect, Such as moves men.</span></p>
<p class="p24">Or thus,</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">There is a</span> prompt <span class="t8">and speechless dialect.</span></p>
<p class="p24">I.ii.194 (20,3) [under grievous imposition] I once thought it should be <span class="t8">inquisition</span>, but the present reading is probably right. <span class="t8">The crime would be under grievous</span> penalties imposed.</p>
<p class="p24">I.iii.2 (20,4) [Believe not, that the dribbling dart of love Can pierce a compleat bosom] Think not that a breast <span class="t8">compleatly armed</span> can be pierced by the dart of love that comes <span class="t8">fluttering without force</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">I.iii.12 (21,5) [(A man of stricture and firm abstinence)] [W: strict ure] <span class="t8">Stricture</span> may easily be used for <span class="t8">strictness</span>; <span class="t8">ure</span> is indeed an old word, but, I think, always applied to things, never to persons.</p>
<p class="p24">I.iii.43 (22,9) [To do it slander] The text stood,</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">So do in slander</span>. &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">Sir Thomas Hammer has very well corrected it thus,</p>
<p class="p24">To <span class="t8">do</span> it <span class="t8">slander</span>. &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">Yet perhaps less alteration might have produced the true reading,</p>
<p class="p26">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="t8">And yet my nature never, in the fight,</span><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So <span class="t8">do</span>ing <span class="t8">slander</span>ed. &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">And yet my nature never suffer slander by doing any open acts of severity. (see 1765, I,279,3)</p>
<p class="p24">I.iii.51 (23,2) [Stands at a guard] Stands on terms of defiance.</p>
<p class="p24">I.iv.30 (24,3) [make me not your story] Do not, by deceiving me, make me a subject for a tale.</p>
<p class="p24">I.iv.41 (26,5)</p>
<p class="p26">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[as blossoming time<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That from the seedness the bare fallow brings<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To teeming foyson, so her plenteous womb<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Expresseth his full tilth and husbandry]</p>
<p class="p24">As the sentence now stands, it is apparently ungrammatical. I read,</p>
<p class="p24">At <span class="t8">blossoming time</span>, &amp;c.</p>
<p class="p24">That is, <span class="t8">As they that feed grow full, so her womb now</span> at blossoming time, <span class="t8">at that time through which the feed time proceeds to the harvest</span>, her womb shows what has been doing. Lucio ludicrously calls pregnancy <span class="t8">blossoming time</span>, the time when fruit is promised, though not yet ripe.</p>
<p class="p24">I.iv.51 (26,6) [Bore many gentlemen, myself being one, In hand, and hope of action] <span class="t8">To bear in hand</span> is a common phrase for <span class="t8">to keep in expectation and dependance</span>, but we should read,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&mdash; with <span class="t8">hope of action</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">I.iv.56 (26,7) [with full line] With full extent, with the whole length.</p>
<p class="p24">I.iv.62 (27,8) [give fear to use] To intimidate <span class="t8">use</span>, that is, practices long countenanced by <span class="t8">custom</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">I.iv.69 (27,9) [Unless you have the grace] That is, the acceptableness, the power of gaining favour. So when she makes her suit, the provost says,</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Heaven give thee moving</span> graces. (1765, I,282,1)</p>
<p class="p24">I.iv.70 (27,1) [pith Of business] The inmost part, the main of my message.</p>
<p class="p24">I.iv.86 (28,4) [the mother] The abbess, or prioress.</p>
<p class="p24">II.i.8 (29,7) [Let but your honour know] To <span class="t8">know</span> is here to <span class="t8">examine</span>, to <span class="t8">take cognisance</span>. So in <span class="t8">Midsummer-Night&rsquo;s Dream</span>,</p>
<p class="p26">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="t8">Therefore, fair Hermia, question your desires</span>;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Know of <span class="t8">your truth, examine well your blood</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">II.i.23 (29,8)</p>
<p class="p26">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[&rsquo;Tis very pregnant,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The jewel that we find, we stoop and take it,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because we see it; but what we do not see,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We tread upon, and never think of it]</p>
<p class="p24">&rsquo;Tis <span class="t8">plain</span> that we must act with bad as with good; we punish the faults, as we take the advantages, that lie in our way, and what we do not see we cannot note.</p>
<p class="p24">II.i.28 (30,8) [For I have had such faults] That is, <span class="t8">because, by reason that I</span> have had faults.</p>
<p class="p24">II.i.57 (31,9) [This comes off well] This is nimbly spoken; this is volubly uttered.</p>
<p class="p24">II.i.63 (32,1) [a tapster, sir; parcel-bawd] This we should now express by saying, <span class="t8">he is</span> half-tapster, half-bawd. (1773)</p>
<p class="p24">II.i.66 (32,2) [she professes a hot-house] A <span class="t8">hot-house</span> is an English name for a <span class="t8">bagnio</span>.</p>
<p class="p26">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="t8">Where lately harbour&rsquo;d many a famous whore,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A purging-bill now fix&rsquo;d upon the door,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tells you it it a</span> hot-house, <span class="t8">so it may.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And still be a whore-house</span>. Ben. Jonson.</p>
<p class="p24">II.i.85 (32,3) [Ay, sir, by mistress Over-done&rsquo;s means] Here seems to have been some mention made of Froth, who was to be accused, and some words therefore may have been lost, unless the irregularity of the narrative may be better imputed to the ignorance of the constable.</p>
<p class="p24">II.i.180 (35,4) [Justice or Iniquity?] These were, I suppose, two personages well known to the audience by their frequent appearance in the old moralities. The words, therefore, at that time, produced a combination of ideas, which they have now lost.</p>
<p class="p24">II.i.183 (35,5) [Hannibal] Mistaken by the constable for <span class="t8">Cannibal</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">II.i.215 (36,6) [they will draw you] <span class="t8">Draw</span> has here a cluster of senses. As it refers to the tapster, it signifies <span class="t8">to drain, to empty</span>; as it is related to hang, it means <span class="t8">to be conveyed to execution on a hurdle</span>. In Froth&rsquo;s answer, it is the same as <span class="t8">to bring along by some motive or power</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">II.i.254 (37,7) [I&rsquo;ll rent the fairest house in it, after three pence a bay] A <span class="t8">bay</span> of building is, in many parts of England, a common term, of which the best conception that I could ever attain, is, that it is the space between the main beams of the roof; so that a barn crossed twice with beams is a barn of three <span class="t8">bays</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">II.ii.26 (40,8) [Stay yet a while] It is not clear why the provost is bidden to stay, nor when he goes out.</p>
<p class="p24">II.ii.32 (40,9) [For which I must not plead but that I am at war, &lsquo;twixt will, and will not] This is obscure; perhaps it may be mended by reading,</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">For which I must</span> now <span class="t8">plead; but</span> yet <span class="t8">I am At war, &lsquo;twixt will, and will not.</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Yet</span> and <span class="t8">yt</span> are almost indistinguishable in a manuscript. Yet no alteration is necessary, since the speech is not unintelligible as it now stands, (see 1765, 9I,294,5)</p>
<p class="p24">II.ii.78 (42,2) [And mercy then will breathe within your lips, Like man new made] I rather think the meaning is, <span class="t8">You would then change the severity of your present character</span>. In familiar speech, <span class="t8">You would be quite another man</span>. (see 1765, 1,296,7)</p>
<p class="p24">II.ii.99 (43,6)</p>
<p class="p24">[<span class="t8">Isab</span>. Yet shew some pity. <span class="t8">Ang</span>. I shew it most of all, when I shew justice; For then I pity those I do not know]</p>
<p class="p24">This was one of Bale&rsquo;s memorials. <span class="t8">When I find myself swayed to mercy, let me remember, that there is a mercy likewise due to the country</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">II.ii.126 (45,2) [We cannot weigh our brother with ourself] [W: yourself] The old reading is right. <span class="t8">We</span> mortals proud and foolish cannot prevail on our passions to <span class="t8">weigh</span> or compare <span class="t8">our brother</span>, a being of like nature and frailty, with <span class="t8">ourself</span>. We have different names and different judgments for the same faults committed by persons of different condition. (1773)</p>
<p class="p24">II.ii.141 (46,3) [She speaks, and &rsquo;tis Such sense, that my sense breeds with it] Thus all the folios. Some later editor has changed <span class="t8">breeds</span> to <span class="t8">bleeds</span>, and Dr. Warburton blames poor Mr. Theobald for recalling the old word, which yet is certainly right. <span class="t8">My sense</span> breeds <span class="t8">with her sense</span>, that is, new thoughts are stirring in my mind, new conceptions are <span class="t8">hatched</span> in my imagination.</p>
<p class="p24">So we say to <span class="t8">brood</span> over thought.</p>
<p class="p24">II.ii.149 (46,4) [tested gold] Rather cupelled, brought to the <span class="t8">test</span>, refined, (see 1765,I,299,6)</p>
<p class="p24">II.ii.157 (47,6) [For I am that way going to temptation, Where prayers cross] Which way Angelo is going to temptation, we begin to perceive; but how <span class="t8">prayers cross</span> that way, or cross each other, at that way, more than any other, I do not understand.</p>
<p class="p24">Isabella prays that his <span class="t8">honour</span> may be safe, meaning only to give him his title: his imagination is caught by the word <span class="t8">honour</span>; he feels that his <span class="t8">honour</span> is in danger, and therefore, I believe, answers thus:</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">I am that way going to temptation</span>, Which your <span class="t8">prayers cross</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">That is, I am tempted to lose that honour of which thou implorest the preservation. The temptation under which I labour is that which thou hast unknowingly <span class="t8">thwarted</span> with thy prayer. He uses the same mode language a few lines lower. Isabella, parting, says, Save your <span class="t8">honour</span>! Angelo catches the word &mdash; <span class="t8">Save it</span>! <span class="t8">From what</span>? <span class="t8">From thee; even from thy virtue</span>! &mdash; (rev. 1778,II,52,3)</p>
<p class="p24">II.ii.165 (47,7)</p>
<p class="p26">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[But it is I,<br/>That lying, by the violet, in the sun,<br/>Do, as the carrion does, not as the flower,<br/>Corrupt with virtuous season.]</p>
<p class="p24">I am not corrupted by her, but by my own heart, which excites foul desires under the same benign influences that exalt her purity, as the carrion grows putrid by those beams which encrease the fragrance of the violet.</p>
<p class="p24">II.ii.186 (48,8) [Ever, till now, When men were fond, I smil&rsquo;d, and wonder&rsquo;d how] As a day must now intervene between this conference of Isabella with Angelo, and the next, the act might more properly end here; and here, in my opinion, it was ended by the poet.</p>
<p class="p24">II.iii.11 (49,1) [Who falling in the flaws of her own youth, Hath blister&rsquo;d her report] Who doth not see that the integrity of the metaphor requires we should read, &mdash; <span class="t8">flames of her own youth</span>? Warburton.]</p>
<p class="p24">Who does not see that, upon such principles, there is no end of correction?</p>
<p class="p24">II.iii.36 (50,3) [There rest] Keep yourself in this temper.</p>
<p class="p24">II.iii.40 (50,4) [Oh, injurious love] Her execution was respited on account of her pregnancy, the effects of her love: therefore she calls it <span class="t8">injurious</span>; not that it brought her to shame, but that it hindered her freeing herself from it. Is not this all very natural? yet the Oxford editor changes it to <span class="t8">injurious law</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">II.iv.9 (51,6) [Grown fear&rsquo;d and tedious] [W: sear&rsquo;d] I think <span class="t8">fear&rsquo;d</span></p>
<p class="p24">may stand. What we go to with reluctance may be said to be <span class="t8">fear&rsquo;d</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">II.iv.13 (51,7) [case] For outside; garb; external shew.</p>
<p class="p24">II.iv.14 (51,8) [Wrench awe from fools, and tie the wiser souls To thy false seeming?] Here Shakespeare judiciously distinguishes the different operations of high place upon different minds. Fools are frighted, and wise men are allured. Those who cannot judge but by the eye, are easily awed by splendour; those who consider men as well as conditions, are easily persuaded to love the appearance of virtue dignified with power.</p>
<p class="p24">II.iv.16 (51,9) [Let&rsquo;s write good angel on the devil&rsquo;s horn; &rsquo;Tis not the devil&rsquo;s crest] [Hammer: Is&rsquo;t not the devil&rsquo;s crest] I am still inclined to the opinion of the Oxford editor. Angelo, reflecting on the difference between his seeming character, and his real disposition, observes, that he <span class="t8">could change his gravity for a plume</span>. He then digresses into an apostrophe, <span class="t8">O dignity, how dost thou impose upon the world</span>! then returning to himself, <span class="t8">Blood</span>, says he, <span class="t8">thou art but blood</span>, however concealed with appearances and decorations. Title and character do not alter nature, which is still corrupt, however dignified.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Let&rsquo;s write good angel on the devil&rsquo;s horn</span>; <span class="t8">Is&rsquo;t not</span>? &mdash; or rather&mdash; &rsquo;Tis<span class="t8"> yet the devil&rsquo;s crest</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">It may however be understood, according to Dr. Warburton&rsquo;s explanation. O place, how dost thou impose upon the world by false appearances! so much, that if we <span class="t8">write good angel on the devil&rsquo;s horn, &rsquo;tis not</span> taken any longer to be <span class="t8">the devil&rsquo;s crest</span>. In this sense,</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Blood, thou art but blood.</span>!</p>
<p class="p24">is an interjected exclamation. (1773)</p>
<p class="p24">II.iv.27 (53,1) [The gen&rsquo;ral subjects to a well-wish&rsquo;d king] So the later editions: but the old copies read,</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">The</span> general subject <span class="t8">to a well-wish&rsquo;d king</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">The <span class="t8">general subject</span> seems a harsh expression, but <span class="t8">general subjects</span> has no sense at all; and <span class="t8">general</span> was, in our authour&rsquo;s time, a word for <span class="t8">people</span>, so that the <span class="t8">general</span> is the <span class="t8">people</span>, or <span class="t8">multitude, subject</span> to a king. So in <span class="t8">Hamlet</span>: <span class="t8">The play pleased not the</span> million; <span class="t8">&rsquo;twas caviare to the</span> general.</p>
<p class="p24">II.iv.47 (54,3) [Falsely to take away a life true made] <span class="t8">Falsely</span> is the same with <span class="t8">dishonestly, illegally</span>: so <span class="t8">false</span>, in the next lines, is <span class="t8">illegal, illegitimate</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">II.iv.48 (54,4) [As to put metal in restrained means] In forbidden moulds. I suspect <span class="t8">means</span> not to be the right word, but I cannot find another.</p>
<p class="p24">II.iv.50 (55,5) [&rsquo;Tis set down so in heaven, but not in earth] I would have it considered, whether the train of the discourse does not rather require Isabel to say,</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">&rsquo;Tis so set down in</span> earth, <span class="t8">but not in</span> heaven.</p>
<p class="p24">When she has said this, <span class="t8">Then</span>, says Angelo, <span class="t8">I shall poze you quickly</span>. Would you, who, for the present purpose, declare your brother&rsquo;s crime to be less in the sight of heaven, than the law has made it; would you commit that crime, light as it is, to save your brother&rsquo;s life? To this she answers, not very plainly in either reading, but more appositely to that which I propose:</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">I had rather give my body, than my soul</span>. (1773)</p>
<p class="p24">II.iv.67 (56,6)</p>
<p class="p26">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Pleas&rsquo;d you to do&rsquo;t at peril of your soul,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were equal poize of sin and charity]</p>
<p class="p24">The reasoning is thus: Angelo asks, whether there might <span class="t8">not be a charity in sin to save this brother</span>. Isabella answers, that <span class="t8">if Angelo will save him, she will stake her soul that it were charity, not sin</span>. Angelo replies, that if Isabella would <span class="t8">save him at the hazard of her soul, it would be not indeed no sin, but a sin to which the charity would be equivalent</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">II.iv.73 (56,7) [And nothing of your answer] I think it should be read,</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">And nothing of</span> yours <span class="t8">answer</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">You, and whatever is <span class="t8">yours</span>, be exempt from penalty.</p>
<p class="p24">II.iv.86 (56,9) [Accountant to the law upon that pain] <span class="t8">Pain</span> is here for <span class="t8">penalty, punishment</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">II.iv.90 (57,2) [But in the loss of question,] The <span class="t8">loss</span> of question I do not well understand, and should rather read,</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">But in the</span> toss <span class="t8">of question</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">In the <span class="t8">agitation</span>, in the <span class="t8">discussion</span> of the question. To <span class="t8">toss</span> an argument is a common phrase.</p>
<p class="p24">II.iv.106 (57,4) [a brother dy&rsquo;d at once] Perhaps we should read,</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Better it were, a brother died</span> for <span class="t8">once, Than that a sister, by redeeming him. Should die</span> for <span class="t8">ever</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">II.iv.123 (58,6) [Owe, and succeed by weakness] To <span class="t8">owe</span> is, in this place, to <span class="t8">own</span>, to <span class="t8">hold</span>, to have possession.</p>
<p class="p24">II.iv.125 (59,7) [the glasses where they view themselves; Which are as easily broke, as they make forms] Would it not be better to read, &mdash;&mdash; take <span class="t8">forms</span>.</p>

<p class="p26">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[I have no tongue but one. Gentle my lord,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me intreat you, speak the former language]</p>
<p class="p24">Isabella answers to his circumlocutory courtship, that she has but <span class="t8">one tongue</span>, she does not understand this new phrase, and desires him to talk his <span class="t8">former language</span>, that is, to talk as he talked before.</p>

So that, by this, he insinuates his authority was so great, that his <span class="t8">denial</span> would have the same credit that a <span class="t8">vouch</span> or testimony has in ordinary cases. Warburton.] I believe this beauty is merely imaginary, and that <span class="t8">vouch against</span> means no more than denial.</p>
<p class="p24">II.iv.165 (60,5) [die the death] This seems to be a solemn phrase for death inflicted by law. So in <span class="t8">Midsummer Night&rsquo;s Dream</span>.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Prepare</span> to die the death.</p>
<p class="p24">II.iv.178 (61,6) [prompture] Suggestion, temptation, instigation.</p>
<p class="p24">III.i.5 (62,8) [Be absolute for death] Be determined to die, without any hope of life. <span class="t8">Horace</span>, &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&mdash; <span class="t8">The hour, which exceeds expectation will be welcome.</span></p>
<p class="p24">III.i.7 (62,9) [I do lose a thing, That none but fools would keep] [W: would reck] The meaning seems plainly this, that <span class="t8">none but fools would</span> wish <span class="t8">to keep life</span>; or, <span class="t8">none but fools would keep</span> it, if choice were allowed. A sense, which whether true or not, is certainly innocent.</p>
<p class="p24">III.i.14 (63,3) [For all the accommodations, that thou bear&rsquo;st Are nurs&rsquo;d by baseness] Dr. Warburton is undoubtedly mistaken in supposing that by <span class="t8">baseness</span> is meant <span class="t8">self-love</span> here assigned as the motive of all human actions. Shakespeare only meant to observe, that a minute analysis of life at once destroys that splendour which dazzles the imagination. Whatever grandeur can display, or luxury enjoy, is procured by <span class="t8">baseness</span>, by offices of which the mind shrinks from the contemplation. All the delicacies of the table may be traced back to the shambles and the dunghill, all magnificence of building was hewn from the quarry, and all the pomp of ornaments dug from among the damps and darkness of the mine.</p>
<p class="p24">III.i.16 (64,4) [the soft and tender fork Of a poor worm] <span class="t8">Worm</span> is put for any creeping thing or <span class="t8">serpent</span>. Shakespeare supposes falsely, but according to the vulgar notion, that a serpent wounds with his tongue, and that his tongue is <span class="t8">forked</span>. He confounds reality and fiction, a serpent&rsquo;s tongue is <span class="t8">soft</span> but not <span class="t8">forked</span> nor hurtful. If it could hurt, it could not be soft. In <span class="t8">Midsummer Night&rsquo;s Dream</span> he has the same notion.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&mdash; <span class="t8">With</span> doubler <span class="t8">tongue Than thine, O serpent, never adder</span> stung.</p>
<p class="p24">III.i.17 (64,5)</p>
<p class="p26">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Thy best of rest is sleep,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that thou oft provok&rsquo;st; yet grosly fear&rsquo;st<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy death which is no more]</p>
<p class="p24">Here Dr. Warburton might have found a sentiment worthy of his</p>
<p class="p24">animadversion. I cannot without indignation find Shakespeare saying, that <span class="t8">death is only sleep</span>, lengthening out his exhortation by a sentence which in the friar is impious, in the reasoner is foolish, and in the poet trite and vulgar.</p>
<p class="p24">III.i.19 (64,6)</p>
<p class="p26">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Thou art not thyself,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For thou exist&rsquo;st on many thousand grains,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That issue out of dust]</p>
<p class="p24">Thou art perpetually repaired and renovated by external assistance, thou subsistest upon foreign matter, and hast no power of producing or continuing thy own being.</p>
<p class="p24">III.i.24 (64,7) [strange effects] For <span class="t8">effects</span> read <span class="t8">affects</span>; that is, <span class="t8">affections</span>, <span class="t8">passions</span> of mind, or disorders of body variously <span class="t8">affected</span>. So in <span class="t8">Othello</span>, <span class="t8">The young</span> affects.</p>
<p class="p24">III.i.32 (65,9)</p>
<p class="p26">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Thou hast nor youth, nor age;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, as it were, an after-dinner&rsquo;s sleep,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dreaming on both]</p>
<p class="p24">This is exquisitely imagined. When we are young, we busy ourselves in forming schemes for succeeding time, and miss the gratifications that are before us; when we are old, we amuse the languor of age with the recollection of youthful pleasures or performances; so that our life, of which no part is filled with the business of the present time, resembles our dreams after dinner, when the events of the morning are mingled with the designs of the evening.</p>
<p class="p24">III.i.34 (65,1)</p>
<p class="p24">[for all thy blessed youth Becomes as aged, and doth beg the alms Of palsied eld]</p>
<p class="p24">[W: for pall&rsquo;d, thy blazed youth Becomes assuaged] Here again I think Dr. Warburton totally mistaken. Shakespeare declares that man has <span class="t8">neither youth nor age</span>; for in <span class="t8">youth</span>, which is the <span class="t8">happiest</span> time, or which might be the happiest, he commonly wants means to obtain what he could enjoy; he is dependent on <span class="t8">palsied eld</span>; <span class="t8">must beg alms</span> from the coffers of hoary avarice: and being very niggardly supplied, <span class="t8">becomes as aged</span>, looks, like an old man, on happiness which is beyond his reach. And when <span class="t8">he is old and rich</span>, when he has wealth enough for the purchase of all that formerly excited his desires, he has no longer the powers of enjoyment,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&mdash; <span class="t8">has neither heat, affection, limb, nor beauty, To make </span>his <span class="t8">riches pleasant</span>. &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">I have explained this passage according to the present reading, which may stand without much inconvenience; yet I am willing to persuade my reader, because I have almost persuaded myself, that our authour wrote,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&mdash; <span class="t8">for all thy</span> blasted <span class="t8">youth Becomes as aged</span> &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">III.i.37 (66,2) [Thou has neither heat, affection, limb, nor beauty To make thy riches pleasant] [W: nor bounty] I am inclined to believe, that neither man nor woman will have much difficulty to tell how <span class="t8">beauty makes riches pleasant</span>. Surely this emendation, though it it elegant and ingenious, is not such as that an opportunity of inserting it should be purchased by declaring ignorance of what every one knows, by confessing insensibility to what every one feels.</p>
<p class="p24">III.i.40 (66,3) [more thousand deaths] For this sir T. Hammer reads, &mdash;&mdash; <span class="t8">a thousand deaths</span>: &mdash;&mdash; The meaning is not only <span class="t8">a thousand deaths</span>, but <span class="t8">a thousand deaths</span> besides what have been mentioned.</p>
<p class="p24">III.i.55 (67,5) [Why, as all comforts are; most good in Deed] If this reading be right, Isabella must mean that she brings something better than <span class="t8">words</span> of comfort, she brings an assurance of <span class="t8">deeds</span>. This is harsh and constrained, but I know not what better to offer. Sir Thomas Hammer reads, &mdash; <span class="t8">in</span> speed.</p>
<p class="p24">III.i.59 (68,6) [an everlasting leiger. Therefore your best appointment] <span class="t8">Leiger</span> is the same with resident. <span class="t8">Appointment</span>; preparation; act of fitting, or state of being fitted for any thing. So in old books, we have a knight well <span class="t8">appointed</span>; that is, well armed and mounted or fitted at all points.</p>
<p class="p24">III.i.68 (68,8)</p>
<p class="p26">&nbsp;[Tho&rsquo; all the world&rsquo;s vastidity you had,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;To a determin&rsquo;d scope]</p>
<p class="p24">A confinement of your mind to one painful idea; to ignominy, of which the remembrance can neither be suppressed nor escaped.</p>

<p class="p26">&nbsp;[And the poor beetle, that we tread upon,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;In corporal sufferance finds a pang as great,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;As when a giant dies]</p>
<p class="p24">The reasoning is, <span class="t8">that death is no more than every being must suffer, though the dread of it is peculiar to man</span>; or perhaps, that we are inconsistent with ourselves, when we so much dread that which we carelessly inflict on other creatures, that feel the pain as acutely as we.</p>
<p class="p24">III.i.91 (69,1) [follies doth emmew] Forces follies to lie in cover without daring to show themselves.</p>

<p class="p26">&nbsp;[If it were damnable, he being so wise,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Why would he for the momentary trick<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Be perdurably fin&rsquo;d?]</p>
<p class="p24">Shakespeare shows his knowledge of human nature in the conduct of Claudio. When Isabella first tells him of Angelo&rsquo;s proposal, he answers, with honest indignation, agreeably to his settled principles,</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Thou shalt not do&rsquo;t.</span></p>
<p class="p24">But the love of life being permitted to operate, soon furnishes him with sophistical arguments, he believes it cannot be very dangerous to the soul, since Angelo, who is so wise, will venture it.</p>
<p class="p24">III.i.121 (71,8) [delighted spirit] This reading may perhaps stand, but many attempts have been made to correct it. The most plausible is that which substitutes,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&mdash; <span class="t8">the</span> benighted <span class="t8">spirit</span>,</p>
<p class="p24">alluding to the darkness always supposed in the place of future punishment.</p>

<p class="p24">III.i.127 (72,9) [lawless and incertain thoughts] Conjecture sent out to wander without any certain direction, and ranging through all possibilities of pain.</p>
<p class="p24">III.i.139 (73,2) [Is&rsquo;t not a kind of incest, to take life From thine own sister&rsquo;s shame?] In Isabella&rsquo;s declamation there is something harsh, and something forced and far-fetched. But her indignation cannot be thought violent, when we consider her not only as a virgin, but as a nun.</p>
<p class="p24">III.i.149 (74,4) [but a trade] A custom; a practice, an established habit. So we say of a man much addicted to any thing, <span class="t8">he makes</span> a trade <span class="t8">of it</span>.</p>

<p class="p24">Sir T. Hammer reads,</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Free from all faults, as from faults seeming free</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">In the interpretation of Dr. Warburton, the sense is trifling, and the expression harsh. To wish <span class="t8">that men were as free from faults, as faults are free from comeliness</span> [instead of <span class="t8">void of comeliness</span>] is a very poor conceit. I once thought it should be read,</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">O that all were, as all would seem to be. Free from all faults</span>, or <span class="t8">from</span> false seeming <span class="t8">free</span>.</p>

<p class="p24">But now I believe that a less alteration will serve the turn.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Free from all faults</span>, or faults from seeming free;</p>
<p class="p24">that men were really good, or that their faults were known, that men were free from faults, <span class="t8">or</span> faults from <span class="t8">hypocrisy</span>. So Isabella calls Angelo&rsquo;s hypocrisy, <span class="t8">seeming, seeming</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">III.ii.42 (81,8) [His neck will come to your waist] That is, his neck will be tied, like your waist, with a rope. The friars of the Franciscan order, perhaps of all others, wear a hempen cord for a girdle. Thus Buchanan,</p>

<p class="p24">III.ii.51 (81,1) [what say&rsquo;st thou to this tune, matter and method? Is&rsquo;t not drown&rsquo;d i&rsquo; the last rain?] [W: It&rsquo;s not down i&rsquo; the last reign] Dr. Warburton&rsquo;s emendation is ingenious, but I know not whether the sense may not be restored with less change. Let us consider it. Lucio, a prating fop, meets his old friend going to prison, and pours out upon him his impertinent interrogatories, to which, when the poor fellow makes no answer, he adds, <span class="t8">What reply? ha? what say&rsquo;st thou to this? tune, matter, and method, &mdash; is&rsquo;t not? drown&rsquo;d i&rsquo; th&rsquo; last rain? ha? what say&rsquo;st thou, trot</span>? &amp;c. It is a common phrase used in low raillery of a man crest-fallen and dejected, that <span class="t8">he looks like a drown&rsquo;d puppy</span>, Lucio, therefore, asks him, whether he was <span class="t8">drowned in the last rain</span>, and therefore cannot speak.</p>
<p class="p24">III.ii.52 (82,2) [what say&rsquo;st thou, trot?] <span class="t8">Trot</span>, or as it is now often pronounced, honest <span class="t8">trout</span>, is a familiar address to a man among the provincial vulgar. (1773)</p>

<p class="p24">To <span class="t8">pattern</span> is <span class="t8">to work after a pattern</span>, and, perhaps, in Shakespeare&rsquo;s licentious diction, simply to work. The sense is, <span class="t8">he that bears the sword of heaven should be holy as well as severe; one that after good examples labours to know himself, to live with innocence, and to act with virtue</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">III.ii.294 (91,5)</p>
<p class="p26">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[So disguise shall, by the disguis&rsquo;d<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pay with falshood false exacting]</p>
<p class="p24">So <span class="t8">disguise</span> shall by means of a person <span class="t8">disguised</span>, return an <span class="t8">injurious demand</span> with a <span class="t8">counterfeit person</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">IY.i.13 (93,4) [My mirth it much displeas&rsquo;d, but pleas&rsquo;d my woe] Though the musick soothed my sorrows, it had no tendency to produce light merriment.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.i.21 (93,5) [constantly] Certainly; without fluctuation of mind.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.i.28 (93,6) [circummur&rsquo;d with brick] <span class="t8">Circummured</span>, walled round. <span class="t8">He caused the doors to be</span> mured <span class="t8">and cased up</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">Painter&rsquo;s Palace of Pleasure.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.i.40 (94,7) [In action all of precept] I rather think we should read,</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">In precept all of action</span>, &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">that is, <span class="t8">in direction given not by words, but by mute signs</span>.</p>

<p class="p24">IV.i.60 (95,9) [O place and greatness] [It plainly appears, that <span class="t8">this</span> fine speech belongs to <span class="t8">that</span> which concludes the preceding scene, between the Duke and Lucio…. But that some time might be given to the two women to confer together, the players, I suppose, took part of the speech, beginning at <span class="t8">No might nor greatness</span>, &amp;c. and put it here, without troubling themselves about its pertinency. Warburton.] I cannot agree that these lines are placed here by the players. The sentiments are common, and such as a prince, given to reflection, must have often present. There was a necessity to fill up the time in which the ladies converse apart, and they must have quick tongues and ready apprehensions, if they understood each other while this speech was uttered.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.i.60 (95,1) [false eyes] That is, Eyes insidious and traiterous.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.i.62 (95,2) [contrarious quests] Different reports, <span class="t8">running counter</span> to each other.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.i.76 (96,4) [for yet our tithe&rsquo;s to sow] [W: tilth] The reader is here attacked with a pretty sophism. We should read <span class="t8">tilth</span>, i.e. our <span class="t8">tillage is to make</span>. But in the text it is <span class="t8">to sow</span>; and who has ever said that his <span class="t8">tillage</span> was to <span class="t8">sow</span>? I believe <span class="t8">tythe</span> is right, and that the expression is proverbial, in which <span class="t8">tithe</span> is taken, by an easy metonymy, for <span class="t8">harvest</span>.</p>
<p class="p26">IV.ii.69 (100,7) [ As fast lock&rsquo;d up in sleep, as guiltless labour<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;When it lies starkly in the traveller&rsquo;s bones ]<br/>Stiffly. These two lines afford a very pleasing image.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.ii.83 (101,1) [Even with the stroke] <span class="t8">Stroke</span> is here put for the <span class="t8">stroke</span> of a pen or a line.</p>

<p class="p24">IV.ii.91 (101,4) [that spirit&rsquo;s possess&rsquo;d with haste, That wounds the unresisting postern with these strokes] The line is irregular, and the <span class="t8">unresisting postern</span> so strange an expression, that want of measure, and want of sense, might justly raise suspicion of an errour, yet none of the later editors seem to have supposed the place faulty, except sir Tho. Hammer, who reads,</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">the</span> unresting <span class="t8">postern</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">The three folio&rsquo;s have it,</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">unsisting postern</span>,</p>
<p class="p24">out of which Mr. Rowe made <span class="t8">unresisting</span>, and the rest followed him. Sir Thomas Hammer seems to have supposed <span class="t8">unresisting</span> the word in the copies, from which he plausibly enough extracted <span class="t8">unresting</span>, but be grounded his emendation on the very syllable that wants authority. What can be made of <span class="t8">unsisting</span> I know not; the best that occurs to me is <span class="t8">unfeeling</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.ii.103 (103,6) [<span class="t8">Duke</span>. This is his lordship&rsquo;s man. <span class="t8">Prov</span>. And here comes Claudio&rsquo;s pardon]</p>
<p class="p24">[Tyrwhitt suggested that the names of the speakers were misplaced] When, immediately after the Duke had hinted his expectation of a pardon, the Provost sees the Messenger, he supposes the Duke to to have <span class="t8">known something</span>, and changes his mind. Either reading may serve equally well. (1773)</p>
<p class="p24">IV.ii.153 (104,7) [desperately mortal] This expression is obscure. Sir Thomas Hammer reads, <span class="t8">mortally desperate</span>. <span class="t8">Mortally</span> is in low conversation used in this sense, but I know not whether it was ever written. I am inclined to believe, that <span class="t8">desperately mortal</span> means <span class="t8">desperately mischievous</span>. Or <span class="t8">desperately mortal</span> may mean a man likely to die in a <span class="t8">desperate</span> state, without reflection or repentance. (see 1765, I,348,7)</p>
<p class="p24">IV.ii.187 (106,8) [and tie the beard] A beard tied would give a very new air to that face, which had never been seen but with the beard loose, long, and squalid. (1773)</p>
<p class="p24">IV.iii.4 (107,2) [First, here&rsquo;s young master Rash] This enumeration of the inhabitants of the prison affords a very striking view of the practices predominant in Shakespeare&rsquo;s age. Besides those whose follies are common to all times, we have four fighting men and a traveller. It is not unlikely that the originals of the pictures were then known.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.iii.17 (108,4) [master Forthlight] Should not <span class="t8">Forthlight</span> be <span class="t8">Forthright</span>, alluding to the line in which the thrust is made? (1773)</p>
<p class="p24">IV.iii.21 (108,6) [in for the Lord&rsquo;s sake] [i.e. to beg for the rest of their lives. Warburton.] I rather think this expression intended to ridicule the puritans, whose turbulence and indecency often brought them to prison, and who considered themselves as suffering for religion.</p>
<p class="p24">It is not unlikely that men imprisoned for other crimes, might represent themselves to casual enquirers, as suffering for puritanism, and that this might be the common cant of the prisons. In Donne&rsquo;s time, every prisoner was brought to jail by suretiship.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.iii.68 (110,7) [After him, fellows] Here was a line given to the Duke, which belongs to the Provost. The Provost, while the Duke is lamenting the obduracy of the prisoner, cries out,</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">After him, fellows</span>, &amp;c.</p>
<p class="p24">and, when they are gone out, turns again to the Duke.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.iii.72 (110,8) [to transport him] To remove him from one world to another. The French <span class="t8">trepas</span> affords a kindred sense.</p>
<p class="p26">IV.iii.115 (112,1)<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[I will keep her ignorant of her good,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;To make her heavenly comforts of despair,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;When least it is expected.]</p>
<p class="p24">A better reason might have been given. It was necessary to keep Isabella in ignorance, that she might with more keenness accuse the deputy.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.iii.139 (113,2) [your bosom] Your wish; your heart&rsquo;s desire.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.iii.149 (113,3) [I am combined by a sacred vow] I once thought this should be <span class="t8">confined</span>, but Shakespeare uses <span class="t8">combine</span> for to <span class="t8">bind by a pact or agreement</span>, so he calls Angelo the <span class="t8">combinate</span> husband of Mariana.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.iii.163 (113,4) [if the old fantastical duke] Sir Thomas Hammer reads, <span class="t8">the</span> odd <span class="t8">fantastical duke</span>, but <span class="t8">old</span> is a common word of aggravation in ludicrous language, as, <span class="t8">there was</span> old <span class="t8">revelling</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.iii.170 (114,5) [woodman] That is, <span class="t8">huntsman</span>, here taken for a <span class="t8">hunter of girls</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.iv.19 (115,6) [sort and suit] Figure and rank.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.iv.27 (115,7) [Yet reason dares her No] Mr. Theobald reads,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&mdash; <span class="t8">Yet reason dares her</span> note.</p>
<p class="p24">Sir Thomas Hammer,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&mdash; <span class="t8">Yet reason dares her: No.</span></p>
<p class="p24">Mr. Upton,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&mdash; <span class="t8">Yet reason dares her &mdash; No</span>,</p>
<p class="p24">which he explains thus: <span class="t8">Yet</span>, says Angelo, <span class="t8">reason will give her courage</span> &mdash; <span class="t8">No</span>, that is, <span class="t8">it will not</span>. I am afraid <span class="t8">dare</span> has no such signification. I have nothing to offer worth insertion.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.iv.28 (116,8)</p>
<p class="p26">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[For my authority bears a credent bulk;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That no particular scandal once can touch]</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Credent</span> is <span class="t8">creditable, inforcing credit, not questionable</span>. The old English writers often confound the active and passive adjectives. So Shakespeare, and Milton after him, use <span class="t8">inexpressive</span> from inexpressible.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Particular</span> is <span class="t8">private</span>, a French sense. No scandal from any <span class="t8">private</span> mouth can reach a man in my authority.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.iv.36 (116,9) [Nothing goes right; we would, and we would not] Here undoubtedly the act should end, and was ended by the poet; for here is properly a cessation of action, and a night intervenes, and the place is changed, between the passages of this scene, and those of the next. The next act beginning with the following scene, proceeds without any interruption of time or change of place.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.v.1 (117,1) [<span class="t8">Duke</span>. These letters at fit time deliver me] Peter never delivers the letters, but tells his story without any credentials. The poet forgot the plot which he had formed.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.vi.4 (118,2) [He says, to vail full purpose] [T: t&rsquo;availful] [Warburton had explained &ldquo;full&rdquo; as &ldquo;beneficial.&rdquo;] <span class="t8">To vail full</span> purpose, may, with very little force on the words, mean, <span class="t8">to hide</span> <span class="t8">the whole extent of our design</span>, and therefore the reading may stand; yet I cannot but think Mr. Theobald&rsquo;s alteration either lucky or ingenious. To interpret words with such laxity, as to make <span class="t8">full</span> the sane with <span class="t8">beneficial</span>, is to put an end, at once, to all necessity of emendation, for any word may then stand in the place of another.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.vi.9 (118,3) [<span class="t8">Enter Peter</span>] This play has two Friars, either of whom might singly have served. I should therefore imagine, that Friar Thomas, in the first act, might be changed, without any harm, to Friar Peter; for why should the Duke unnecessarily trust two in an affair which required only one. The none of Friar Thomas is never mentioned in the dialogue, and therefore seems arbitrarily placed at the head of the scene.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.vi.14 (119,4) [Have bent the gates] Have taken possession of the gates, (rev. 1778, II,134,4)</p>
<p class="p24">V.i.20 (120,5) [vail your regard] That is, withdraw your thoughts from higher things, let your notice descend upon a wronged woman. To <span class="t8">vail</span>, is to lower.</p>
<p class="p24">V.i.45 (121,6) [truth is truth To the end of reckoning] That is, truth has no gradations; nothing which admits of encrease can be so much what it is, as <span class="t8">truth</span> is <span class="t8">truth</span>. There may be a <span class="t8">strange</span> thing, and a thing <span class="t8">more strange</span>, but if a proposition be <span class="t8">true</span>, there can be none <span class="t8">more true</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">V.i.54 (121,7) [as shy, as grave, as just, as absolute] <span class="t8">As shy</span>; as reserved, as abstracted: <span class="t8">as just</span>; as nice, as exact: <span class="t8">as absolute</span>; as complete in all the round of duty.</p>
<p class="p24">V.i.56 (121,8) [In all his dressings] In all his semblance of virtue, in all his habiliments of office.</p>
<p class="p24">V.i.64 (122,1) [do not banish reason For inequality] Let not the high quality of my adversary prejudice you against me.</p>
<p class="p24">V.i.104 (124,4) [Oh, that it were as like, as it is true!] [Warburton had explained &ldquo;like&rdquo; as &ldquo;seemly.&rdquo;] <span class="t8">Like</span> I have never found for <span class="t8">seemly</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">V.i.107 (124,8) [In hateful practice] <span class="t8">Practice</span> was used by the old writers for any unlawful or insidious stratagem. So again,</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">This must needs be</span> practice:</p>
<p class="p24">and again,</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Let me have way to find this</span> practice <span class="t8">out</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">V.i.145 (125,6) [nor a temporary medler] It is hard to know what is meant by a <span class="t8">temporary</span> medler. In its usual sense, as opposed to <span class="t8">perpetual</span>, it cannot be used here. It may stand for <span class="t8">temporal</span>: the sense will then be, <span class="t8">I know him for a holy man, one that meddles not with</span> secular <span class="t8">affairs</span>. It may mean <span class="t8">temporising</span>: I know him to be a holy man, one who would not temporise, <span class="t8">or take the opportunity of your absence to defame you</span>. Or we may read,</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Not scurvy, nor a</span> tamperer and <span class="t8">medler</span>:</p>
<p class="p24">not one who would bare <span class="t8">tampered</span> with this woman to make her a false evidence against your deputy.</p>
<p class="p24">V.i.160 (126,8) [So vulgarly and personally accus&rsquo;d] Meaning either so <span class="t8">grosly</span>, with such <span class="t8">indecency</span> of invective, or by so <span class="t8">mean</span> and inadequate witnesses.</p>
<p class="p24">V.i.205 (128,2) [This is a strange abuse] <span class="t8">Abuse</span> stands in this place for <span class="t8">deception</span>, or <span class="t8">puzzle</span>. So in <span class="t8">Macbeth</span>,</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">This strange and self</span> abuse,</p>
<p class="p24">means, <span class="t8">this strange</span> deception <span class="t8">of himself</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">V.i.219 (129,3) [her promised proportions Came short of composition] Her fortune, which was promised <span class="t8">proportionate</span> to mine, fell short of the <span class="t8">composition</span>, that is, contract or bargain.</p>
<p class="p24">V.i.236 (129,4) [These poor informal women] I once believed <span class="t8">informal</span> had no other or deeper signification than <span class="t8">informing, accusing</span>. The <span class="t8">scope</span> of justice, is the full extent; but think, upon farther enquiry, that <span class="t8">informal</span> signifies <span class="t8">incompetent, not qualified to give testimony</span>. Of this use there are precedents to be found, though I cannot now recover them.</p>
<p class="p24">V.i.245 (130,5) [That&rsquo;s seal&rsquo;d in approbation?] Then any thing subject to counterfeits is tried by the proper officers and approved, a stamp or <span class="t8">seal</span> is put upon it, as among us on plate, weights, and measures. So the Duke says, that Angela&rsquo;s faith has been tried, <span class="t8">approved</span>, and <span class="t8">seal&rsquo;d</span> in testimony of that <span class="t8">approbation</span>, and, like other things so <span class="t8">sealed</span>, is no more to be called in question.</p>
<p class="p24">V.i.255 (131,6) [to hear this matter forth] To hear it to the end; to search it to the bottom.</p>
<p class="p26">V.i.303 (132,4) [to retort your manifest appeal] To <span class="t8">refer back</span> to<br/>Angelo and the cause in which you <span class="t8">appealed</span> from Angelo to the<br/>Duke.</p>
<p class="p24">V.i.317 (133,5) [his subject I am not, Nor here provincial] Nor here <span class="t8">accountable</span>. The meaning seems to be, I am not one of his natural subjects, nor of any dependent province.</p>
<p class="p24">V.i.323 (133,6) [the forfeits in a barber&rsquo;s shop] [Warburton had explained that a list of forfeitures were posted in barber shops to warn patrons to keep their hands off the barber&rsquo;s surgical instruments.] This explanation may serve till a better is discovered. But whoever has seen the instruments of a chirurgeon, knows that they may be very easily kept out of improper hands in a very small box, or in his pocket.</p>
<p class="p24">V.i.336 (134,7) [And was the duke a fleshmonger, a fool, and a coward, as you then reported him to be?] So again afterwards,</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">You, sirrah, that know me for a fool, a</span> coward, <span class="t8">One of all luxury</span> &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">But Lucio had not, in the former conversation, mentioned <span class="t8">cowardice</span> among the faults of the duke. &mdash; Such failures of memory are incident to writers more diligent than this poet.</p>
<p class="p24">V.i.359 (135,8) [show your sheep-biting face, and be hang&rsquo;d an hour&rsquo; Will&rsquo;t not off?] This is intended to be the common language of vulgar indignation. Our phrase on such occasions is simply; <span class="t8">show your sheep-biting face, and be hanged</span>. The words <span class="t8">an hour</span> have no particular use here, nor are authorised by custom. I suppose it was written thus, <span class="t8">show your sheep-biting face, and be hanged &mdash; an&rsquo; how? wilt not off</span>? In the midland counties, upon any unexpected obstruction or resistance, it is common to exclaim <span class="t8">an&rsquo; how</span>?</p>
<p class="p24">V.i.388 (136,9) [Advertising, and holy] Attentive and faithful.</p>
<p class="p24">V.i.393 (136,l) [be you as free to us] Be as <span class="t8">generous</span> to us, pardon us as we have pardoned you.</p>
<p class="p24">V.i.401 (136,2) [That brain&rsquo;d my purpose] We now use in conversation a like phrase. <span class="t8">This it was that knocked my design on the head</span>. Dr. Warburton reads,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&mdash; baned <span class="t8">my purpose</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">V.i.413 (137,3) [even from his proper tongue] Even from Angelo&rsquo;s <span class="t8">own tongue</span>. So above.</p>
<p class="p26">&nbsp;<span class="t8">In the witness of his</span> proper <span class="t8">ear<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;To call him villain.</span></p>
<p class="p24">V.i.438 (138,5) [Against all sense you do importune her] The meaning required is, against all reason and natural affection; Shakespeare, therefore, judiciously uses a single word that implies both; <span class="t8">sense</span> signifying both reason and affection.</p>
<p class="p24">V.i.452 (139,6) [&lsquo;Till he did look on me] The duke has justly observed that Isabel is <span class="t8">importuned against all sense</span> to solicit for Angelo, yet here <span class="t8">against all sense</span> she solicits for him. Her argument is extraordinary.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">A due sincerity govern&rsquo;d his deeds, &lsquo;Till he did look on me; since it is so. Let him not die.</span></p>
<p class="p24">That Angelo had committed all the crimes charged against him, as far as he could commit them, is evident. The only <span class="t8">intent</span> which <span class="t8">his</span> act did not overtake, was the defilement of Isabel. Of this Angelo was only intentionally guilty.</p>
<p class="p24">Angela&rsquo;s crimes were such, as must sufficiently justify punishment, whether its end be to secure the innocent from wrong, or to deter guilt by example; and I believe every reader feels some indignation when he finds him spared. From what extenuation of his crime, can Isabel, who yet supposes her brother dead, form any plea in his favour. <span class="t8">Since he was good &lsquo;till he looked on me, let him not die</span>. I am afraid our varlet poet intended to inculcate, that women think ill of nothing that raises the credit of their beauty, and are ready, however virtuous, to pardon any act which they think incited by their own charms.</p>
<p class="p24">V.i.488 (140,7) [But, for those earthly faults, I quit them all] Thy faults, so far as they are punishable on earth, so far as they are cognisable by temporal power, I forgive.</p>
<p class="p24">V.i.499 (141,8) [By this, lord Angelo perceives he&rsquo;s safe] It is somewhat strange, that Isabel is not made to express either gratitude, wonder or joy at the sight of her brother.</p>
<p class="p24">V.i.501 (141,9) [your evil quits you well] <span class="t8">Quits you</span>, recompenses, requites you.</p>
<p class="p24">V.i.502 (141,1) [Look, that you love your wife; her worth, worth yours] Sir T. Hammer reads,</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Her worth</span> works <span class="t8">yours</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">This reading is adopted by Dr. Warburton, but for what reason? How does her <span class="t8">worth work Angelo&rsquo;s worth</span>? it has only contributed to <span class="t8">work</span> his pardon. The words are, as they are too frequently, an affected gingle, but the sense is plain. <span class="t8">Her worth, worth yours</span>; that is, her value is equal to your value, the match is not unworthy of you.</p>
<p class="p24">V.i.504 (141,2) [And yet here&rsquo;s one in place I cannot pardon] After the pardon of two murderers, Lucio might be treated by the good duke with less harshness; but perhaps the poet intended to show, what is too often seen, <span class="t8">that men easily forgive wrongs which are not committed against themselves</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">V.i.509 (142,3) [according to the trick] To my custom, my habitual practice.</p>
<p class="p24">V.i.526 (142,4) [thy other forfeits] Thy other punishments.</p>
<p class="p24">V.i.534 (142,5) [Thanks, good friend Escalus, for thy much goodness] I have always thought that there is great confusion in this concluding speech. If my criticism would not be censured as too licentious, I should regulate it thus,</p>
<p class="p26">&nbsp;Thanks, good friend Escalus, for thy much goodness.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks. Provost, for thy care and secrecy;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;We shall employ thee in a worthier place.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Forgive him, Angelo, that brought you home<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;The head of Ragozine for Claudio&rsquo;s.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="t8">Ang</span>. <span class="t8">Th&rsquo; offence pardons itself</span>.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="t8">Duke</span>, <span class="t8">There&rsquo;s more behind<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;That is more gratulate. Dear Isabel,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a motion</span>,&amp;c,</p>
<p class="p24">V.i.545 (143,6) General Observation The novel of Cynthio Giraldi, from which Shakespeare is supposed to have borrowed this fable, may be read in <span class="t8">Shakespeare illustrated</span>, elegantly translated, with remarks which will assist the enquirer to discover how much absurdity Shakespeare has admitted or avoided. I cannot but suspect that some other had new-modelled the novel of Cynthio, or written a story which in some particulars resembled it, and that Cynthio was not the authour whom Shakespeare immediately followed. The emperour in Cynthio is named Maximine; the duke, in Shakespeare&rsquo;s enumeration of the persons of the drama, is called Vincentio. This appears a very slight remark; but since the duke has no name in the play, nor is ever mentioned but by his title, why should he be called Vincentio among the <span class="t8">persons</span>, but because the name was copied from the story, and placed superfluously at the head of the list by the mere habit of transcription? It is therefore likely that there was then a story of Vincentio duke of Vienna, different from that of Maximine emperour of the Romans.</p>
<p class="p24">Of this play the light or comick part is very natural and pleasing, but the grave scenes, if a few passages be excepted, have more labour than elegance. The plot is rather intricate than artful. The time of the action is indefinite; some time, we know not how much, must have elapsed between the recess of the duke and the imprisonment of Claudio; for he must have learned the story of Mariana in his disguise, or he delegated his power to a man already known to be corrupted. The unities of action and place are sufficiently preserved.</p>
