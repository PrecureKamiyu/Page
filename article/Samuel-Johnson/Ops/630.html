<p class="p21">A letter borrowed by the English from the Greek alphabet. It has before all the vowels one invariable sound: as, <span class="t8">keen, ken, kill</span>; but is not much in use, except after <span class="t8">c</span> at the end of words: as, <span class="t8">knock, clock, crack, back, brick, stick, pluck, check</span>, which were written anciently with <span class="t8">e</span> final: as, <span class="t8">clocke, checke, tricke</span>. It is also in use between a vowel and the silent <span class="t8">e</span> final: as, <span class="t8">cloke, broke, brake, pike, duke, eke</span>. It likewise ends a word after a diphthong: as, <span class="t8">look, break, shook, leek</span>. The English never use <span class="t8">c</span> at the end of a word. <span class="t8">K</span> is silent in the present pronunciation before <span class="t8">n</span>: as, <span class="t8">knife, knee, knell.</span></p>

The sails are to flat her about, if she comes too near the shore. They also carry out an anchor in the head of the boat, with a hawser that comes from the ship; which anchor, if the ship comes too near the shore, they let fall in the stream, and so wind her head about it; then weigh the anchor again when she is about, which is called <span class="t8">kedging</span>, and from this use the anchor a kedger. <span class="t8">Harris.</span></p>
