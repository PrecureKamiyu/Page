<p class="p26">At length, must Suffolk beauties shine in vain,<br/>So long renown&rsquo;d in B &mdash; n&rsquo;s deathless strain?<br/>Thy charms, at least, fair Firebrace, might inspire<br/>Some zealous bard to wake the sleeping lyre;<br/>For, such thy beauteous mind and lovely face,<br/>Thou seem&rsquo;st at once, bright nymph, a muse and grace.</p>
<p class="p26">&nbsp;This lady was Bridget, third daughter of Philip Bacon, esq. of<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ipswich, and relict of Philip Evers, esq. of that town. She became<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the second wife of sir Cordell Firebrace, the last baronet of that<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;name, to whom she brought a fortune of 25,000 pounds, July 26, 1737.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being again left a widow, in 1759, she was a third time married,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;April 7, 1762, to William Campbell, esq. uncle to the late duke of<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Argyle, and died July 3, 1782.</p>
