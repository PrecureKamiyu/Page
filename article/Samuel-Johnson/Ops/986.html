<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am obliged to you for all your pamphlets, and of the last I hope to make some use. I made some of the former.</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;I am, dear Sir,<br/>&lsquo;Your most affectionate servant,<br/>&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;July 4, 1774.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;My compliments to all the three ladies.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">&lsquo;TO BENNET LANGTON, ESQ., AT LANGTON, NEAR SPILSBY, LINCOLNSHIRE.</span></p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;You have reason to reproach me that I have left your last letter so long unanswered, but I had nothing particular to say. Chambers, you find, is gone far, and poor Goldsmith is gone much further. He died of a fever, exasperated, as I believe, by the fear of distress. He had raised money and squandered it, by every artifice of acquisition, and folly of expence. But let not his frailties be remembered; he was a very great man.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I have just begun to print my <span class="t8">Journey to the Hebrides</span>, and am leaving the press to take another journey into Wales, whither Mr. Thrale is going, to take possession of, at least, five hundred a year, fallen to his lady. All at Streatham, that are alive, are well.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I have never recovered from the last dreadful illness, but flatter myself that I grow gradually better; much, however, yet remains to mend. [Greek: Kurie eleaeson].</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;If you have the Latin version of <span class="t8">Busy, curious, thirsty fly</span>, be so kind as to transcribe and send it; but you need not be in haste, for I shall be I know not where, for at least five weeks. I wrote the following tetastrick on poor Goldsmith: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p26">[Greek:<br/>&lsquo;Ton taphon eisoraas ton Olibaroio koniaen<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Aphrosi mae semnaen, Xeine, podessi patei<br/>Oisi memaele phusis, metron charis, erga palaion,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Klaiete posaetaen, istorikon, phusikon.]</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Please to make my most respectful compliments to all the ladies, and remember me to young George and his sisters. I reckon George begins to shew a pair of heels.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Do not be sullen now, but let me find a letter when I come back.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am, dear Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your affectionate, humble servant,</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;July 5, 1774.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To MR. ROBERT LEVET.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Llewenny, in Denbighshire, Aug. 16, 1774.</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Mr. Thrale&rsquo;s affairs have kept him here a great while, nor do I know exactly when we shall come hence. I have sent you a bill upon Mr. Strahan.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I have made nothing of the Ipecacuanha, but have taken abundance of pills, and hope that they have done me good.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Wales, so far as I have yet seen of it, is a very beautiful and rich country, all enclosed, and planted. Denbigh is not a mean town. Make my compliments to all my friends, and tell Frank I hope he remembers my advice. When his money is out, let him have more.</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;I am, Sir,<br/>&lsquo;Your humble servant,<br/>&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">&lsquo;MR. BOSWELL TO DR. JOHNSON.</span></p>
<p class="p21">&lsquo;Edinburgh, Aug. 30, 1774.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;You have given me an inscription for a portrait of Mary Queen of Scots, in which you, in a short and striking manner, point out her hard fate. But you will be pleased to keep in mind, that my picture is a representation of a particular scene in her history; her being forced to resign her crown, while she was imprisoned in the castle of Lochlevin. I must, therefore, beg that you will be kind enough to give me an inscription suited to that particular scene; or determine which of the two formerly transmitted to you is the best; and, at any rate, favour me with an English translation. It will be doubly kind if you comply with my request speedily.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your critical notes on the specimen of Lord Hailes&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Annals of Scotland</span> are excellent, I agreed with you in every one of them. He himself objected only to the alteration of <span class="t8">free to brave</span>, in the passage where he says that Edward &ldquo;departed with the glory due to the conquerour of a free people.&rdquo; He says, &ldquo;to call the Scots brave would only add to the glory of their conquerour.&rdquo; You will make allowance for the national zeal of our annalist. I now send a few more leaves of the <span class="t8">Annals</span>, which I hope you will peruse, and return with observations, as you did upon the former occasion. Lord Hailes writes to me thus:&mdash; &ldquo;Mr. Boswell will be pleased to express the grateful sense which Sir David Dalrymple has of Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s attention to his little specimen. The further specimen will show, that</p>
<p class="p24">&ldquo;Even in an Edward he can see desert.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;It gives me much pleasure to hear that a republication of <span class="t8">Isaac Walton&rsquo;s Lives</span> is intended. You have been in a mistake in thinking that Lord Hailes had it in view. I remember one morning, while he sat with you in my house, he said, that there should be a new edition of <span class="t8">Walton&rsquo;s Lives</span>; and you said that &ldquo;they should be benoted a little.&rdquo; This was all that passed on that subject. You must, therefore, inform Dr. Horne, that he may resume his plan, I enclose a note concerning it; and if Dr. Horne will write to me, all the attention that I can give shall be cheerfully bestowed, upon what I think a pious work, the preservation and elucidation of Walton, by whose writings I have been most pleasingly edified.&rsquo;</p>

<p class="p21">&lsquo;Edinburgh, Sept. 16, 1774.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Wales has probably detained you longer than I supposed. You will have become quite a mountaineer, by visiting Scotland one year and Wales another. You must next go to Switzerland. Cambria will complain, if you do not honour her also with some remarks. And I find <span class="t8">concessere column√¶</span>, the booksellers expect another book. I am impatient to see your <span class="t8">Tour to Scotland and the Hebrides</span>. Might you not send me a copy by the post as soon as it is printed off?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p10">* * * * *</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">&lsquo;TO JAMES BOSWELL, ESQ.</span></p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Yesterday I returned from my Welch journey, I was sorry to leave my book suspended so long; but having an opportunity of seeing, with so much convenience, a new part of the island, I could not reject it. I have been in five of the six counties of North Wales; and have seen St. Asaph and Bangor, the two seats of their Bishops; have been upon Penmanmaur and Snowden, and passed over into Anglesea. But Wales is so little different from England, that it offers nothing to the speculation of the traveller.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;When I came home, I found several of your papers, with some pages of Lord Hailes&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Annals</span>, which I will consider. I am in haste to give you some account of myself, lest you should suspect me of negligence in the pressing business which I find recommended to my care, and which I knew nothing of till now, when all care is vain.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;In the distribution of my books I purpose to follow your advice, adding such as shall occur to me. I am not pleased with your notes of remembrance added to your names, for I hope I shall not easily forget them.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I have received four Erse books, without any direction, and suspect that they are intended for the Oxford library. If that is the intention, I think it will be proper to add the metrical psalms, and whatever else is printed in <span class="t8">Erse</span>, that the present may be complete. The donor&rsquo;s name should be told.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I wish you could have read the book before it was printed, but our distance does not easily permit it.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am sorry Lord Hailes does not intend to publish <span class="t8">Walton</span>; I am afraid it will not be done so well, if it be done at all.</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;I purpose now to drive the book forward. Make my compliments to Mrs.<br/>Boswell, and let me hear often from you.</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;I am, dear Sir,<br/>&lsquo;Your affectionate humble servant,<br/>&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;London, Octob. 1, 1774.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">This tour to Wales, which was made in company with Mr. and Mrs. Thrale, though it no doubt contributed to his health and amusement, did not give an occasion to such a discursive exercise of his mind as our tour to the Hebrides. I do not find that he kept any journal or notes of what he saw there. All that I heard him say of it was, that &lsquo;instead of bleak and barren mountains, there were green and fertile ones; and that one of the castles in Wales would contain all the castles that he had seen in Scotland.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Parliament having been dissolved, and his friend Mr. Thrale, who was a steady supporter of government, having again to encounter the storm of a contested election, he wrote a short political pamphlet, entitled <span class="t8">The Patriot</span>, addressed to the electors of Great-Britain; a title which, to factious men, who consider a patriot only as an opposer of the measures of government, will appear strangely misapplied. It was, however, written with energetick vivacity; and, except those passages in which it endeavours to vindicate the glaring outrage of the House of Commons in the case of the Middlesex election, and to justify the attempt to reduce our fellow-subjects in America to unconditional submission, it contained an admirable display of the properties of a real patriot, in the original and genuine sense; &mdash; a sincere, steady, rational, and unbiassed friend to the interests and prosperity of his King and country. It must be acknowledged, however, that both in this and his two former pamphlets, there was, amidst many powerful arguments, not only a considerable portion of sophistry, but a contemptuous ridicule of his opponents, which was very provoking.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To MR. PERKINS.</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SIR,</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;You may do me a very great favour. Mrs. Williams, a gentlewoman whom<br/>you may have seen at Mr. Thrale&rsquo;s, is a petitioner for Mr.<br/>Hetherington&rsquo;s charity: petitions are this day issued at Christ&rsquo;s<br/>Hospital.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am a bad manager of business in a crowd; and if I should send a mean man, he may be put away without his errand. I must therefore intreat that you will go, and ask for a petition for Anna Williams, whose paper of enquiries was delivered with answers at the counting-house of the hospital on Thursday the 20th. My servant will attend you thither, and bring the petition home when you have it.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The petition, which they are to give us, is a form which they deliver to every petitioner, and which the petitioner is afterwards to fill up, and return to them again. This we must have, or we cannot proceed according to their directions. You need, I believe, only ask for a petition; if they enquire for whom you ask, you can tell them.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I beg pardon for giving you this trouble; but it is a matter of great importance.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am, Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your most humble servant,</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">&lsquo;SAM JOHNSON.&rsquo;</span></p>
<p class="p21">&lsquo;October 25, 1774.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To JAMES BOSWELL, ESQ.</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;There has appeared lately in the papers an account of a boat overset between Mull and Ulva, in which many passengers were lost, and among them Maclean of Col. We, you know, were once drowned; I hope, therefore, that the story is either wantonly or erroneously told. Pray satisfy me by the next post.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I have printed two hundred and forty pages. I am able to do nothing much worth doing to dear Lord Hailes&rsquo;s book. I will, however, send back the sheets; and hope, by degrees, to answer all your reasonable expectations.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Mr. Thrale has happily surmounted a very violent and acrimonious opposition; but all joys have their abatement: Mrs. Thrale has fallen from her horse, and hurt herself very much. The rest of our friends, I believe, are well. My compliments to Mrs. Boswell.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am, Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">Your most affectionate servant,</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;London, October. 27, 1774.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">This letter, which shows his tender concern for an amiable young gentleman to whom he had been very much obliged in the Hebrides, I have inserted according to its date, though before receiving it I had informed him of the melancholy event that the young Laird of Col was unfortunately drowned.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To JAMES BOSWELL, ESQ.</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Last night I corrected the last page of our <span class="t8">Journey to the Hebrides</span>. The printer has detained it all this time, for I had, before I went into Wales, written all except two sheets. <span class="t8">The Patriot</span> was called for by my political friends on Friday, was written on Saturday, and I have heard little of it. So vague are conjectures at a distance. As soon as I can, I will take care that copies be sent to you, for I would wish that they might be given before they are bought; but I am afraid that Mr. Strahan will send to you and to the booksellers at the same time. Trade is as diligent as courtesy. I have mentioned all that you recommended. Pray make my compliments to Mrs. Boswell and the younglings. The club has, I think, not yet met.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Tell me, and tell me honestly, what you think and what others say of our travels. Shall we touch the continent?</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am, dear Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your most humble servant,</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Nov. 26, 1774.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">In his manuscript diary of this year, there is the following entry: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;Nov. 27. Advent Sunday. I considered that this day, being the beginning<br/>of the ecclesiastical year, was a proper time for a new course of life.<br/>I began to read the Greek Testament regularly at 160 verses every<br/>Sunday. This day I began the Acts.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;In this week I read Virgil&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Pastorals</span>. I learned to repeat the <span class="t8">Pollio</span> and <span class="t8">Gallus</span>. I read carelessly the first <span class="t8">Georgick</span>.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Such evidences of his unceasing ardour, both for &lsquo;divine and human lore,&rsquo; when advanced into his sixty-fifth year, and notwithstanding his many disturbances from disease, must make us at once honour his spirit, and lament that it should be so grievously clogged by its material tegument. It is remarkable, that he was very fond of the precision which calculation produces. Thus we find in one of his manuscript diaries, &lsquo;12 pages in 4to. Gr. Test, and 30 pages in Beza&rsquo;s folio, comprize the whole in 40 days.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;DR. JOHNSON TO JOHN HOOLE, Esq.</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I have returned your play, which you will find underscored with red, where there was a word which I did not like. The red will be washed off with a little water.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The plot is so well framed, the intricacy so artful, and the disentanglement so easy, the suspense so affecting, and the passionate parts so properly interposed, that I have no doubt of its success.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am, Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your most humble servant,</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;December 19, 1774.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">1775: AETAT. 66. &mdash; The first effort of his pen in 1775 was, &lsquo;Proposals for publishing the Works of Mrs. Charlotte Lennox,&rsquo;[Dagger] in three volumes quarto. In his diary, January 2, I find this entry: &lsquo;Wrote Charlotte&rsquo;s Proposals.&rsquo; But, indeed, the internal evidence would have been quite sufficient. Her claim to the favour of the public was thus enforced: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Most of the pieces, as they appeared singly, have been read with approbation, perhaps above their merits, but of no great advantage to the writer. She hopes, therefore, that she shall not be considered as too indulgent to vanity, or too studious of interest, if, from that labour which has hitherto been chiefly gainful to others, she endeavours to obtain at last some profit for herself and her children. She cannot decently enforce her claim by the praise of her own performances; nor can she suppose, that, by the most artful and laboured address, any additional notice could be procured to a publication, of which Her MAJESTY has condescended to be the PATRONESS.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p26">He this year also wrote the Preface to Baretti&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Easy Lessons in<br/>Italian and English</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To JAMES BOSWELL, ESQ.</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;You never did ask for a book by the post till now, and I did not think on it. You see now it is done. I sent one to the King, and I hear he likes it.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I shall send a parcel into Scotland for presents, and intend to give to many of my friends. In your catalogue you left out Lord Auchinleck.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Let me know, as fast as you read it, how you like it; and let me know if any mistake is committed, or any thing important left out. I wish you could have seen the sheets. My compliments to Mrs. Boswell, and to Veronica, and to all my friends.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am, Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your most humble servant,</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;January 14, 1775.</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">&lsquo;MR. BOSWELL TO DR. JOHNSON.</span></p>
<p class="p21">&lsquo;Edinburgh, Jan. 19, 1775.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Be pleased to accept of my best thanks for your <span class="t8">Journey to the Hebrides</span>, which came to me by last night&rsquo;s post. I did really ask the favour twice; but you have been even with me by granting it so speedily. <span class="t8">Bis dat qui cito dat</span>. Though ill of a bad cold, you kept me up the greatest part of the last night; for I did not stop till I had read every word of your book. I looked back to our first talking of a visit a visit to the Hebrides, which was many years ago, when sitting by ourselves in the Mitre tavern, in London, I think about <span class="t8">witching time o&rsquo; night</span>; and then exulted in contemplating our scheme fulfilled, and a <span class="t8">monumentum perenne</span> of it erected by your superiour abilities. I shall only say, that your book has afforded me a high gratification. I shall afterwards give you my thoughts on particular passages. In the mean time, I hasten to tell you of your having mistaken two names, which you will correct in London, as I shall do here, that the gentlemen who deserve the valuable compliments which you have paid them, may enjoy their honours. In page 106, for <span class="t8">Gordon</span> read <span class="t8">Murchison</span>; and in page 357, for <span class="t8">Maclean</span> read <span class="t8">Macleod</span>.</p>
<p class="p10">* * * * *</p>
<p class="p21">&lsquo;But I am now to apply to you for immediate aid in my profession, which you have never refused to grant when I requested it. I enclose you a petition for Dr. Memis, a physician at Aberdeen, in which Sir John Dalrymple has exerted his talents, and which I am to answer as Counsel for the managers of the Royal Infirmary in that city. Mr. Jopp, the Provost, who delivered to you your freedom, is one of my clients, and, <span class="t8">as a citizen of Aberdeen</span>, you will support him.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The fact is shortly this. In a translation of the charter of the Infirmary from Latin into English, made under the authority of the managers, the same phrase in the original is in one place rendered <span class="t8">Physician</span>, but when applied to Dr. Memis is rendered <span class="t8">Doctor of Medicine</span>. Dr. Memis complained of this before the translation was printed, but was not indulged with having it altered; and he has brought an action for damages, on account of a supposed injury, as if the designation given to him was an inferiour one, tending to make it be supposed he is <span class="t8">not a Physician</span>, and, consequently, to hurt his practice. My father has dismissed the action as groundless, and now he has appealed to the whole Court.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">&lsquo;TO JAMES BOSWELL, ESQ.</span></p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;I long to hear how you like the book; it is, I think, much liked here.<br/>But Macpherson is very furious; can you give me any more intelligence<br/>about him, or his Fingal? Do what you can and do it quickly. Is Lord<br/>Hailes on our side?</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Pray let me know what I owed you when I left you, that I may send it to you.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am going to write about the Americans. If you have picked up any hints among your lawyers, who are great masters of the law of nations, or if your own mind suggests any thing, let me know. But mum, it is a secret.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I will send your parcel of books as soon as I can; but I cannot do as I wish. However, you find every thing mentioned in the book which you recommended.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Langton is here; we are all that ever we were. He is a worthy fellow, without malice, though not without resentment.</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;Poor Beauclerk is so ill, that his life is thought to be in danger.<br/>Lady Di nurses him with very great assiduity.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Reynolds has taken too much to strong liquor, and seems to delight in his new character.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;This is all the news that I have; but as you love verses, I will send you a few which I made upon Inchkenneth; but remember the condition, you shall not show them, except to Lord Hailes, whom I love better than any man whom I know so little. If he asks you to transcribe them for him, you may do it, but I think he must promise not to let them be copied again, nor to show them as mine.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I have at last sent back Lord Hailes&rsquo;s sheets. I never think about returning them, because I alter nothing. You will see that I might as well have kept them. However, I am ashamed of my delay; and if I have the honour of receiving any more, promise punctually to return them by the next post. Make my compliments to dear Mrs. Boswell, and to Miss Veronica.</p>

<p class="p21">&lsquo;As for myself, I am ashamed to say I have read little and thought little on the subject of America. I will be much obliged to you, if you will direct me where I shall find the best information of what is to be said on both sides. It is a subject vast in its present extent and future consequences. The imperfect hints which now float in my mind, tend rather to the formation of an opinion that our government has been precipitant and severe in the resolutions taken against the Bostonians. Well do you know that I have no kindness for that race. But nations, or bodies of men, should, as well as individuals, have a fair trial, and not be condemned on character alone. Have we not express contracts with our colonies, which afford a more certain foundation of judgement, than general political speculations on the mutual rights of States and their provinces or colonies? Pray let me know immediately what to read, and I shall diligently endeavour to gather for you any thing that I can find. Is Burke&rsquo;s speech on American taxation published by himself? Is it authentick? I remember to have heard you say, that you had never considered East-Indian affairs; though, surely, they are of much importance to Great-Britain. Under the recollection of this, I shelter myself from the reproach of ignorance about the Americans. If you write upon the subject I shall certainly understand it. But, since you seem to expect that I should know something of it, without your instruction, and that my own mind should suggest something, I trust you will put me in the way.</p>

It is confidently told here, that before your book came out he sent to you, to let you know that he understood you meant to deny the authenticity of Ossian&rsquo;s poems; that the originals were in his possession; that you might have inspection of them, and might take the evidence of people skilled in the Erse language; and that he hoped, after this fair offer, you would not be so uncandid as to assert that he had refused reasonable proof. That you paid no regard to his message, but published your strong attack upon him; and then he wrote a letter to you, in such terms as he thought suited to one who had not acted as a man of veracity. You may believe it gives me pain to hear your conduct represented as unfavourable, while I can only deny what is said, on the ground that your character refutes it, without having any information to oppose. Let me, I beg it of you, be furnished with a sufficient answer to any calumny upon this occasion.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Lord Hailes writes to me, (for we correspond more than we talk together,) &ldquo;As to Fingal, I see a controversy arising, and purpose to keep out of its way. There is no doubt that I might mention some circumstances; but I do not choose to commit them to paper.&rdquo; What his opinion is, I do not know. He says, &ldquo;I am singularly obliged to Dr. Johnson for his accurate and useful criticisms. Had he given some strictures on the general plan of the work, it would have added much to his favours.&rdquo; He is charmed with your verses on Inchkenneth, says they are very elegant, but bids me tell you he doubts whether be according to the rubrick; but that is your concern; for, you know, he is a Presbyterian.&rsquo;</p>

<p class="p21">&lsquo;To DR. LAWRENCE.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Feb. 7, 1775.</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;One of the Scotch physicians is now prosecuting a corporation that in some publick instrument have stiled him <span class="t8">Doctor of Medicine</span> instead of <span class="t8">Physician</span>. Boswell desires, being advocate for the corporation, to know whether <span class="t8">Doctor of Medicine</span> is not a legitimate title, and whether it may be considered as a disadvantageous distinction. I am to write to-night; be pleased to tell me.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am, Sir, your most, &amp;c.,</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To JAMES BOSWELL, ESQ.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;My DEAR BOSWELL,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am surprised that, knowing as you do the disposition of your countrymen to tell lies in favour of each other, you can be at all affected by any reports that circulate among them. Macpherson never in his life offered me a sight of any original or of any evidence of any kind; but thought only of intimidating me by noise and threats, till my last answer, &mdash; that I would not be deterred from detecting what I thought a cheat, by the menaces of a ruffian &mdash; put an end to our correspondence.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The state of the question is this. He, and Dr. Blair, whom I consider as deceived, say, that he copied the poem from old manuscripts. His copies, if he had them, and I believe him to have none, are nothing. Where are the manuscripts? They can be shown if they exist, but they were never shown. <span class="t8">De non existentibus et non apparentibus</span>, says our law, <span class="t8">eadem est ratio</span>. No man has a claim to credit upon his own word, when better evidence, if he had it, may be easily produced. But, so far as we can find, the Erse language was never written till very lately for the purposes of religion. A nation that cannot write, or a language that was never written, has no manuscripts.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;But whatever he has he never offered to show. If old manuscripts should now be mentioned, I should, unless there were more evidence than can be easily had, suppose them another proof of Scotch conspiracy in national falsehood.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Do not censure the expression; you know it to be true.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Dr. Memis&rsquo;s question is so narrow as to allow no speculation; and I have no facts before me but those which his advocate has produced against you.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I consulted this morning the President of the London College of Physicians, who says, that with us, <span class="t8">Doctor of Physick</span> (we do not say <span class="t8">Doctor of Medicine</span>) is the highest title that a practicer of physick can have; that <span class="t8">Doctor</span> implies not only <span class="t8">Physician</span>, but teacher of physick; that every <span class="t8">Doctor</span> is legally a <span class="t8">Physician</span>; but no man, not a <span class="t8">Doctor</span>, can <span class="t8">practice physick</span> but by <span class="t8">licence</span> particularly granted. The Doctorate is a licence of itself. It seems to us a very slender cause of prosecution.</p>
<p class="p10">* * * * *</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;I am now engaged, but in a little time I hope to do all you would have.<br/>My compliments to Madam and Veronica.</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;I am, Sir,<br/>&lsquo;Your most humble servant,<br/>&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;February 7, 1775.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">What words were used by Mr. Macpherson in his letter to the venerable Sage, I have never heard; but they are generally said to have been of a nature very different from the language of literary contest. Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s answer appeared in the newspapers of the day, and has since been frequently re-published; but not with perfect accuracy. I give it as dictated to me by himself, written down in his presence, and authenticated by a note in his own hand-writing, &lsquo;<span class="t8">This, I think, is a true copy</span>.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">&lsquo;MR. JAMES MACPHERSON,</span></p>
<p class="p21">&lsquo;I received your foolish and impudent letter. Any violence offered me I shall do my best to repel; and what I cannot do for myself, the law shall do for me. I hope I shall never be deterred from detecting what I think a cheat, by the menaces of a ruffian.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;What would you have me retract? I thought your book an imposture; I think it an imposture still. For this opinion I have given my reasons to the publick, which I here dare you to refute. Your rage I defy. Your abilities, since your Homer, are not so formidable; and what I hear of your morals, inclines me to pay regard not to what you shall say, but to what you shall prove. You may print this if you will.</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Mr. Macpherson little knew the character of Dr. Johnson, if he supposed that he could be easily intimidated; for no man was ever more remarkable for personal courage. He had, indeed, an aweful dread of death, or rather, &lsquo;of something after death;&rsquo; and what rational man, who seriously thinks of quitting all that he has ever known, and going into a new and unknown state of being, can be without that dread? But his fear was from reflection; his courage natural. His fear, in that one instance, was the result of philosophical and religious consideration. He feared death, but he feared nothing else, not even what might occasion death. Many instances of his resolution may be mentioned. One day, at Mr. Beauclerk&rsquo;s house in the country, when two large dogs were fighting, he went up to them, and beat them till they separated; and at another time, when told of the danger there was that a gun might burst if charged with many balls, he put in six or seven, and fired it off against a wall. Mr. Langton told me, that when they were swimming together near Oxford, he cautioned Dr. Johnson against a pool, which was reckoned particularly dangerous; upon which Johnson directly swam into it. He told me himself that one night he was attacked in the street by four men, to whom he would not yield, but kept them all at bay, till the watch came up, and carried both him and them to the round-house. In the playhouse at Lichfield, as Mr. Garrick informed me, Johnson having for a moment quitted a chair which was placed for him between the side-scenes, a gentleman took possession of it, and when Johnson on his return civilly demanded his seat, rudely refused to give it up; upon which Johnson laid hold of it, and tossed him and the chair into the pit. Foote, who so successfully revived the old comedy, by exhibiting living characters, had resolved to imitate Johnson on the stage, expecting great profits from his ridicule of so celebrated a man. Johnson being informed of his intention, and being at dinner at Mr. Thomas Davies&rsquo;s the bookseller, from whom I had the story, he asked Mr. Davies &lsquo;what was the common price of an oak stick;&rsquo; and being answered six-pence, &lsquo;Why then, Sir, (said he,) give me leave to send your servant to purchase me a shilling one. I&rsquo;ll have a double quantity; for I am told Foote means to <span class="t8">take me off</span>, as he calls it, and I am determined the fellow shall not do it with impunity.&rsquo; Davies took care to acquaint Foote of this, which effectually checked the wantonness of the mimick. Mr. Macpherson&rsquo;s menaces made Johnson provide himself with the same implement of defence; and had he been attacked, I have no doubt that, old as he was, he would have made his corporal prowess be felt as much as his intellectual.</p>
<p class="p24">His <span class="t8">Journey to the Western Islands of Scotland</span> is a most valuable performance. It abounds in extensive philosophical views of society, and in ingenious sentiment and lively description. A considerable part of it, indeed, consists of speculations, which many years before he saw the wild regions which we visited together, probably had employed his attention, though the actual sight of those scenes undoubtedly quickened and augmented them. Mr. Orme, the very able historian, agreed with me in this opinion, which he thus strongly expressed:&mdash; &lsquo;There are in that book thoughts, which, by long revolution in the great mind of Johnson, have been formed and polished like pebbles rolled in the ocean!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">That he was to some degree of excess a <span class="t8">true-born Englishman</span>, so as to have entertained an undue prejudice against both the country and the people of Scotland, must be allowed. But it was a prejudice of the head, and not of the heart. He had no ill-will to the Scotch; for, if he had been conscious of that, he would never have thrown himself into the bosom of their country, and trusted to the protection of its remote inhabitants with a fearless confidence. His remark upon the nakedness of the country, from its being denuded of trees, was made after having travelled two hundred miles along the eastern coast, where certainly trees are not to be found near the road; and he said it was &lsquo;a map of the road&rsquo; which he gave. His disbelief of the authenticity of the poems ascribed to Ossian, a Highland bard, was confirmed in the course of his journey, by a very strict examination of the evidence offered for it; and although their authenticity was made too much a national point by the Scotch, there were many respectable persons in that country, who did not concur in this; so that his judgement upon the question ought not to be decried, even by those who differ from him. As to myself, I can only say, upon a subject now become very uninteresting, that when the fragments of Highland poetry first came out, I was much pleased with their wild peculiarity, and was one of those who subscribed to enable their editor, Mr. Macpherson, then a young man, to make a search in the Highlands and Hebrides for a long poem in the Erse language, which was reported to be preserved somewhere in those regions. But when there came forth an Epick Poem in six books, with all the common circumstances of former compositions of that nature; and when, upon an attentive examination of it, there was found a perpetual recurrence of the same images which appear in the fragments; and when no ancient manuscript, to authenticate the work, was deposited in any publick library, though that was insisted on as a reasonable proof, <span class="t8">who</span> could forbear to doubt?</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson&rsquo;s grateful acknowledgements of kindnesses received in the course of this tour, completely refute the brutal reflections which have been thrown out against him, as if he had made an ungrateful return; and his delicacy in sparing in his book those who we find from his letters to Mrs. Thrale were just objects of censure, is much to be admired. His candour and amiable disposition is conspicuous from his conduct, when informed by Mr. Macleod, of Rasay, that he had committed a mistake, which gave that gentleman some uneasiness. He wrote him a courteous and kind letter, and inserted in the news-papers an advertisement, correcting the mistake.</p>
<p class="p24">The observations of my friend Mr. Dempster in a letter written to me, soon after he had read Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s book, are so just and liberal, that they cannot be too often repeated:</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;There is nothing in the book, from beginning to end, that a Scotchman need to take amiss. What he says of the country is true; and his observations on the people are what must naturally occur to a sensible, observing, and reflecting inhabitant of a convenient metropolis, where a man on thirty pounds a year may be better accommodated with all the little wants of life, than Col or Sir Allan.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am charmed with his researches concerning the Erse language, and the antiquity of their manuscripts. I am quite convinced; and I shall rank Ossian and his Fingals and Oscars amongst the nursery tales, not the true history of our country, in all time to come.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Upon the whole, the book cannot displease, for it has no pretensions. The authour neither says he is a geographer, nor an antiquarian, nor very learned in the history of Scotland, nor a naturalist, nor a fossilist. The manners of the people, and the face of the country, are all he attempts to describe, or seems to have thought of. Much were it to be wished, that they who have travelled into more remote, and of course more curious regions, had all possessed his good sense. Of the state of learning, his observations on Glasgow University show he has formed a very sound judgement. He understands our climate too; and he has accurately observed the changes, however slow and imperceptible to us, which Scotland has undergone, in consequence of the blessings of liberty and internal peace.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p10">* * * * *</p>
<p class="p21">Mr. Knox, another native of Scotland, who has since made the same tour, and published an account of it, is equally liberal.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I have read (says he,) his book again and again, travelled with him from Berwick to Glenelg, through countries with which I am well acquainted; sailed with him from Glenelg to Rasay, Sky, Rum, Col, Mull, and Icolmkill, but have not been able to correct him in any matter of consequence. I have often admired the accuracy, the precision, and the justness of what he advances, respecting both the country and the people.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The Doctor has every where delivered his sentiments with freedom, and in many instances with a seeming regard for the benefit of the inhabitants and the ornament of the country. His remarks on the want of trees and hedges for shade, as well as for shelter to the cattle, are well founded, and merit the thanks, not the illiberal censure of the natives. He also felt for the distresses of the Highlanders, and explodes with great propriety the bad management of the grounds, and the neglect of timber in the Hebrides.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Having quoted Johnson&rsquo;s just compliments on the Rasay family, he says,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;On the other hand, I found this family equally lavish in their encomiums upon the Doctor&rsquo;s conversation, and his subsequent civilities to a young gentleman of that country, who, upon waiting upon him at London, was well received, and experienced all the attention and regard that a warm friend could bestow. Mr. Macleod having also been in London, waited upon the Doctor, who provided a magnificent and expensive entertainment in honour of his old Hebridean acquaintance.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">And talking of the military road by Fort Augustus, he says,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;By this road, though one of the most rugged in Great Britain, the celebrated Dr. Johnson passed from Inverness to the Hebride Isles. His observations on the country and people are extremely correct, judicious, and instructive.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Mr. Tytler, the acute and able vindicator of Mary Queen of Scots, in one of his letters to Mr. James Elphinstone, published in that gentleman&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Forty Years&rsquo; Correspondence</span>, says,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I read Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s Tour with very great pleasure. Some few errours he has fallen into, but of no great importance, and those are lost in the numberless beauties of his work.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;If I had leisure, I could perhaps point out the most exceptionable places; but at present I am in the country, and have not his book at hand. It is plain he meant to speak well of Scotland; and he has in my apprehension done us great honour in the most capital article, the character of the inhabitants.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">His private letters to Mrs. Thrale, written during the course of his journey, which therefore may be supposed to convey his genuine feelings at the time, abound in such benignant sentiments towards the people who showed him civilities, that no man whose temper is not very harsh and sour, can retain a doubt of the goodness of his heart.</p>
<p class="p24">It is painful to recollect with what rancour he was assailed by numbers of shallow irritable North Britons, on account of his supposed injurious treatment of their country and countrymen, in his <span class="t8">Journey</span>. Had there been any just ground for such a charge, would the virtuous and candid Dempster have given his opinion of the book, in the terms which I have quoted? Would the patriotick Knox have spoken of it as he has done? Would Mr. Tytler, surely</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo; &mdash; a Scot, if ever Scot there were,&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">have expressed himself thus? And let me add, that, citizen of the world as I hold myself to be, I have that degree of predilection for my <span class="t8">natale solum</span>, nay, I have that just sense of the merit of an ancient nation, which has been ever renowned for its valour, which in former times maintained its independence against a powerful neighbour, and in modern times has been equally distinguished for its ingenuity and industry in civilized life, that I should have felt a generous indignation at any injustice done to it. Johnson treated Scotland no worse than he did even his best friends, whose characters he used to give as they appeared to him, both in light and shade. Some people, who had not exercised their minds sufficiently, condemned him for censuring his friends. But Sir Joshua Reynolds, whose philosophical penetration and justness of thinking were not less known to those who lived with him, than his genius in his art is admired by the world, explained his conduct thus: &lsquo;He was fond of discrimination, which he could not show without pointing out the bad as well as the good in every character; and as his friends were those whose characters he knew best, they afforded him the best opportunity for showing the acuteness of his judgement.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He expressed to his friend Mr. Windham of Norfolk, his wonder at the extreme jealousy of the Scotch, and their resentment at having their country described by him as it really was; when, to say that it was a country as good as England, would have been a gross falsehood. &lsquo;None of us, (said he), would be offended if a foreigner who has travelled here should say, that vines and olives don&rsquo;t grow in England.&rsquo; And as to his prejudice against the Scotch, which I always ascribed to that nationality which he observed in <span class="t8">them</span>, he said to the same gentleman, &lsquo;When I find a Scotchman, to whom an Englishman is as a Scotchman, that Scotchman shall be as an Englishman to me.&rsquo; His intimacy with many gentlemen of Scotland, and his employing so many natives of that country as his amanuenses, prove that his prejudice was not virulent; and I have deposited in the British Museum, amongst other pieces of his writing, the following note in answer to one from me, asking if he would meet me at dinner at the Mitre, though a friend of mine, a Scotchman, was to be there: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Mr. Johnson does not see why Mr. Boswell should suppose a Scotchman less acceptable than any other man. He will be at the Mitre.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">My much-valued friend Dr. Barnard, now Bishop of Killaloe, having once expressed to him an apprehension, that if he should visit Ireland he might treat the people of that country more unfavourably than he had done the Scotch; he answered, with strong pointed double-edged wit, &lsquo;Sir, you have no reason to be afraid of me. The Irish are not in a conspiracy to cheat the world by false representations of the merits of their countrymen. No, Sir; the Irish are a FAIR PEOPLE; &mdash; they never speak well of one another.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson told me of an instance of Scottish nationality, which made a very unfavourable impression upon his mind. A Scotchman, of some consideration in London, solicited him to recommend, by the weight of his learned authority, to be master of an English school, a person of whom he who recommended him confessed he knew no more but that he was his countryman. Johnson was shocked at this unconscientious conduct.</p>
<p class="p24">All the miserable cavillings against his <span class="t8">Journey</span>, in news-papers, magazines, and other fugitive publications, I can speak from certain knowledge, only furnished him with sport. At last there came out a scurrilous volume, larger than Johnson&rsquo;s own, filled with malignant abuse, under a name, real or fictitious, of some low man in an obscure corner of Scotland, though supposed to be the work of another Scotchman, who has found means to make himself well known both in Scotland and England. The effect which it had upon Johnson was, to produce this pleasant observation to Mr. Seward, to whom he lent the book: &lsquo;This fellow must be a blockhead. They don&rsquo;t know how to go about their abuse. Who will read a five shilling book against me? No, Sir, if they had wit, they should have kept pelting me with pamphlets.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;MR. BOSWELL TO DR. JOHNSON.<br/>&lsquo;Edinburgh, Feb. 18, 1775.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;You would have been very well pleased if you had dined with me to-day. I had for my guests, Macquharrie, young Maclean of Col, the successor of our friend, a very amiable man, though not marked with such active qualities as his brother; Mr. Maclean of Torloisk in Mull, a gentleman of Sir Allan&rsquo;s family; and two of the clan Grant; so that the Highland and Hebridean genius reigned. We had a great deal of conversation about you, and drank your health in a bumper. The toast was not proposed by me, which is a circumstance to be remarked, for I am now so connected with you, that any thing that I can say or do to your honour has not the value of an additional compliment. It is only giving you a guinea out of that treasure of admiration which already belongs to you, and which is no hidden treasure; for I suppose my admiration of you is co-existent with the knowledge of my character.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I find that the Highlanders and Hebrideans in general are much fonder of your <span class="t8">Journey</span> than the low-country or <span class="t8">hither</span> Scots. One of the Grants said to-day, that he was sure you were a man of a good heart, and a candid man, and seemed to hope he should be able to convince you of the antiquity of a good proportion of the poems of Ossian. After all that has passed, I think the matter is capable of being proved to a certain degree. I am told that Macpherson got one old Erse MS. from Clanranald, for the restitution of which he executed a formal obligation; and it is affirmed, that the Gaelick (call it Erse or call it Irish,) has been written in the Highlands and Hebrides for many centuries. It is reasonable to suppose, that such of the inhabitants as acquired any learning, possessed the art of writing as well as their Irish neighbours, and Celtick cousins; and the question is, can sufficient evidence be shewn of this?</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Those who are skilled in ancient writings can determine the age of MSS. or at least can ascertain the century in which they were written; and if men of veracity, who are so skilled, shall tell us that MSS. in the possession of families in the Highlands and isles are the works of a remote age, I think we should be convinced by their testimony.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;There is now come to this city, Ranald Macdonald from the Isle of Egg, who has several MSS. of Erse poetry, which he wishes to publish by subscription. I have engaged to take three copies of the book, the price of which is to be six shillings, as I would subscribe for all the Erse that can be printed be it old or new, that the language may be preserved. This man says, that some of his manuscripts are ancient; and, to be sure, one of them which was shewn to me does appear to have the duskyness of antiquity.</p>
<p class="p10">* * * * *</p>
<p class="p21">&lsquo;The enquiry is not yet quite hopeless, and I should think that the exact truth may be discovered, if proper means be used. I am, &amp;c.</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;JAMES BOSWELL.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">To JAMES BOSWELL, ESQ.</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am sorry that I could get no books for my friends in Scotland. Mr. Strahan has at last promised to send two dozen to you. If they come, put the names of my friends into them; you may cut them out, and paste them with a little starch in the book.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;You then are going wild about Ossian. Why do you think any part can be proved? The dusky manuscript of Egg is probably not fifty years old; if it be an hundred, it proves nothing. The tale of Clanranald is no proof. Has Clanranald told it? Can he prove it? There are, I believe, no Erse manuscripts. None of the old families had a single letter in Erse that we heard of. You say it is likely that they could write. The learned, if any learned there were, could; but knowing by that learning, some written language, in that language they wrote, as letters had never been applied to their own. If there are manuscripts, let them be shewn, with some proof that they are not forged for the occasion. You say many can remember parts of Ossian. I believe all those parts are versions of the English; at least there is no proof of their antiquity.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Macpherson is said to have made some translations himself; and having taught a boy to write it, ordered him to say that he had learnt it of his grandmother. The boy, when he grew up, told the story. This Mrs. Williams heard at Mr. Strahan&rsquo;s table. Don&rsquo;t be credulous; you know how little a Highlander can be trusted. Macpherson is, so far as I know, very quiet. Is not that proof enough? Every thing is against him. No visible manuscript; no inscription in the language: no correspondence among friends: no transaction of business, of which a single scrap remains in the ancient families. Macpherson&rsquo;s pretence is, that the character was Saxon. If he had not talked unskilfully of <span class="t8">manuscripts</span>, he might have fought with oral tradition much longer. As to Mr. Grant&rsquo;s information, I suppose he knows much less of the matter than ourselves.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;In the mean time, the bookseller says that the sale is sufficiently quick. They printed four thousand. Correct your copy wherever it is wrong, and bring it up. Your friends will all be glad to see you. I think of going myself into the country about May.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am sorry that I have not managed to send the book sooner. I have left four for you, and do not restrict you absolutely to follow my directions in the distribution. You must use your own discretion.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Make my compliments to Mrs. Boswell: I suppose she is now just beginning to forgive me.</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;I am, dear Sir, your humble servant,<br/>&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;<br/>&lsquo;Feb. 25, 1775.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Tuesday, March 21, I arrived in London; and on repairing to Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s before dinner, found him in his study, sitting with Mr. Peter Garrick, the elder brother of David, strongly resembling him in countenance and voice, but of more sedate and placid manners. Johnson informed me, that &lsquo;though Mr. Beauclerk was in great pain, it was hoped he was not in danger, and that he now wished to consult Dr. Heberden to try the effect of a <span class="t8">new understanding</span>.&rsquo; Both at this interview, and in the evening at Mr. Thrale&rsquo;s, where he and Mr. Peter Garrick and I met again, he was vehement on the subject of the Ossian controversy; observing, &lsquo;We do not know that there are any ancient Erse manuscripts; and we have no other reason to disbelieve that there are men with three heads, but that we do not know that there are any such men.&rsquo; He also was outrageous, upon his supposition that my countrymen &lsquo;loved Scotland better than truth,&rsquo; saying, &lsquo;All of them, &mdash; nay not all, &mdash; but <span class="t8">droves</span> of them, would come up, and attest any thing for the honour of Scotland.&rsquo; He also persevered in his wild allegation, that he questioned if there was a tree between Edinburgh and the English border older than himself. I assured him he was mistaken, and suggested that the proper punishment would be that he should receive a stripe at every tree above a hundred years old, that was found within that space. He laughed, and said, &lsquo;I believe I might submit to it for a <span class="t8">banbee</span>!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">The doubts which, in my correspondence with him, I had ventured to state as to the justice and wisdom of the conduct of Great-Britain towards the American colonies, while I at the same time requested that he would enable me to inform myself upon that momentous subject, he had altogether disregarded; and had recently published a pamphlet, entitled, <span class="t8">Taxation no Tyranny; an answer to the Resolutions and Address of the American Congress</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">He had long before indulged most unfavourable sentiments of our fellow-subjects in America. For, as early as 1769, I was told by Dr. John Campbell, that he had said of them, &lsquo;Sir, they are a race of convicts, and ought to be thankful for any thing we allow them short of hanging.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Of this performance I avoided to talk with him; for I had now formed a clear and settled opinion, that the people of America were well warranted to resist a claim that their fellow-subjects in the mother-country should have the entire command of their fortunes, by taxing them without their own consent; and the extreme violence which it breathed, appeared to me so unsuitable to the mildness of a Christian philosopher, and so directly opposite to the principles of peace which he had so beautifully recommended in his pamphlet respecting Falkland&rsquo;s Islands, that I was sorry to see him appear in so unfavourable a light. Besides, I could not perceive in it that ability of argument, or that felicity of expression, for which he was, upon other occasions, so eminent. Positive assertion, sarcastical severity, and extravagant ridicule, which he himself reprobated as a test of truth, were united in this rhapsody.</p>
<p class="p24">That this pamphlet was written at the desire of those who were then in power, I have no doubt; and, indeed, he owned to me, that it had been revised and curtailed by some of them. He told me, that they had struck out one passage, which was to this effect: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;That the Colonists could with no solidity argue from their not having been taxed while in their infancy, that they should not now he taxed. We do not put a calf into the plow; we wait till he is an ox.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He said, &lsquo;They struck it out either critically as too ludicrous, or politically as too exasperating. I care not which. It was their business. If an architect says, I will build five stories, and the man who employs him says, I will have only three, the employer is to decide.&rsquo; &lsquo;Yes, Sir, (said I,) in ordinary cases. But should it be so when the architect gives his skill and labour <span class="t8">gratis</span>?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Unfavourable as I am constrained to say my opinion of this pamphlet was, yet, since it was congenial with the sentiments of numbers at that time, and as everything relating to the writings of Dr. Johnson is of importance in literary history, I shall therefore insert some passages which were struck out, it does not appear why, either by himself or those who revised it. They appear printed in a few proof leaves of it in my possession, marked with corrections in his own hand-writing. I shall distinguish them by <span class="t8">Italicks</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">In the paragraph where he says the Americans were incited to resistance by European intelligence from</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Men whom they thought their friends, but who were friends only to themselves,&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">there followed, &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;<span class="t8">and made by their selfishness, the enemies of their country</span>&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">And the next paragraph ran thus: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;On the original contrivers of mischief, <span class="t8">rather than on those whom they have deluded</span>, let an insulted nation pour out its vengeance.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">The paragraph which came next was in these words: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;<span class="t8">Unhappy is that country in which men can hope for advancement by favouring its enemies. The tranquillity of stable government is not always easily preserved against the machinations of single innovators; but what can be the hope of quiet, when factions hostile to the legislature can be openly formed and openly avowed?</span>&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">After the paragraph which now concludes the pamphlet, there followed this, in which he certainly means the great Earl of Chatham, and glances at a certain popular Lord Chancellor.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;<span class="t8">If, by the fortune of war, they drive us utterly away, what they will do next can only be conjectured. If a new monarchy is erected, they will want a KING. He who first takes into his hand the sceptre of America, should have a name of good omen. WILLIAM has been known both as conqueror and deliverer; and perhaps England, however contemned, might yet supply them with ANOTHER WILLIAM. Whigs, indeed, are not willing to be governed; and it is possible that KING WILLIAM may be strongly inclined to guide their measures: but Whigs have been cheated like other mortals, and suffered their leader to become their tyrant, under the name of their PROTECTOR. What more they will receive from England, no man can tell. In their rudiments of empire they may want a CHANCELLOR</span>.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Then came this paragraph: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;<span class="t8">Their numbers are, at present, not quite sufficient for the greatness which, in some form of government or other, is to rival the ancient monarchies; but by Dr. Franklin&rsquo;s rule of progression, they will, in a century and a quarter, be more than equal to the inhabitants of Europe. When the Whigs of America are thus multiplied, let the Princes of the earth tremble in their palaces. If they should continue to double and to double, their own hemisphere would not contain them. But let not our boldest oppugners of authority look forward with delight to this futurity of Whiggism</span>.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">How it ended I know not, as it is cut off abruptly at the foot of the last of these proof pages.</p>
<p class="p24">His pamphlets in support of the measures of administration were published on his own account, and he afterwards collected them into a volume, with the title of <span class="t8">Political Tracts, by the Authour of the Rambler</span>, with this motto: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;Fallitur egregio quisquis sub Principe credit<br/>Servitium; nunquam libertas gratior extat<br/>Quam sub Rege pio.&rsquo; CLAUDIANUS.</p>
<p class="p24">These pamphlets drew upon him numerous attacks. Against the common weapons of literary warfare he was hardened; but there were two instances of animadversion which I communicated to him, and from what I could judge, both from his silence and his looks, appeared to me to impress him much.</p>
<p class="p24">One was, <span class="t8">A Letter to Dr. Samuel Johnson, occasioned by his late political Publications</span>. It appeared previous to his <span class="t8">Taxation no Tyranny</span>, and was written by Dr. Joseph Towers. In that performance, Dr. Johnson was treated with the respect due to so eminent a man, while his conduct as a political writer was boldly and pointedly arraigned, as inconsistent with the character of one, who, if he did employ his pen upon politics,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;It might reasonably be expected should distinguish himself, not by party violence and rancour, but by moderation and by wisdom.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">It concluded thus: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I would, however, wish you to remember, should you again address the publick under the character of a political writer, that luxuriance of imagination or energy of language will ill compensate for the want of candour, of justice, and of truth. And I shall only add, that should I hereafter be disposed to read, as I heretofore have done, the most excellent of all your performances, <span class="t8">The Rambler</span>, the pleasure which I have been accustomed to find in it will be much diminished by the reflection that the writer of so moral, so elegant, and so valuable a work, was capable of prostituting his talents in such productions as <span class="t8">The False Alarm</span>, the <span class="t8">Thoughts on the Transactions respecting Falkland&rsquo;s Islands</span>, and <span class="t8">The Patriot</span>&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I am willing to do justice to the merit of Dr. Towers, of whom I will say, that although I abhor his Whiggish democratical notions and propensities, (for I will not call them principles,) I esteem him as an ingenious, knowing, and very convivial man.</p>
<p class="p24">The other instance was a paragraph of a letter to me, from my old and most intimate friend, the Reverend Mr. Temple, who wrote the character of Gray, which has had the honour to be adopted both by Mr. Mason and Dr. Johnson in their accounts of that poet. The words were, &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;How can your great, I will not say your <span class="t8">pious</span>, but your <span class="t8">moral</span> friend, support the barbarous measures of administration, which they have not the face to ask even their infidel pensioner Hume to defend.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">However confident of the rectitude of his own mind, Johnson may have felt sincere uneasiness that his conduct should be erroneously imputed to unworthy motives, by good men; and that the influence of his valuable writings should on that account be in any degree obstructed or lessened.</p>
<p class="p24">He complained to a Right Honourable friend of distinguished talents and very elegant manners, with whom he maintained a long intimacy, and whose generosity towards him will afterwards appear, that his pension having been given to him as a literary character, he had been applied to by administration to write political pamphlets; and he was even so much irritated, that he declared his resolution to resign his pension. His friend shewed him the impropriety of such a measure, and he afterwards expressed his gratitude, and said he had received good advice. To that friend he once signified a wish to have his pension secured to him for his life; but he neither asked nor received from government any reward whatsoever for his political labours.</p>
<p class="p24">On Friday, March 24, I met him at the LITERARY CLUB, where were Mr. Beauclerk, Mr. Langton, Mr. Colman, Dr. Percy, Mr. Vesey, Sir Charles Bunbury, Dr. George Fordyce, Mr. Steevens, and Mr. Charles Fox. Before he came in, we talked of his <span class="t8">Journey to the Western Islands</span>, and of his coming away &lsquo;willing to believe the second sight,&rsquo; which seemed to excite some ridicule. I was then so impressed with the truth of many of the stories of it which I had been told, that I avowed my conviction, saying, &lsquo;He is only <span class="t8">willing</span> to believe: I <span class="t8">do</span> believe. The evidence is enough for me, though not for his great mind. What will not fill a quart bottle will fill a pint bottle. I am filled with belief.&rsquo; &lsquo;Are you? (said Colman,) then cork it up.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I found his <span class="t8">Journey</span> the common topick of conversation in London at this time, wherever I happened to be. At one of Lord Mansfield&rsquo;s formal Sunday evening conversations, strangely called <span class="t8">Lev√©es</span>, his Lordship addressed me, &lsquo;We have all been reading your travels, Mr. Boswell.&rsquo; I answered, &lsquo;I was but the humble attendant of Dr. Johnson.&rsquo; The Chief Justice replied, with that air and manner which none, who ever saw and heard him, can forget, &lsquo;He speaks ill of nobody but Ossian.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson was in high spirits this evening at the club, and talked with great animation and success. He attacked Swift, as he used to do upon all occasions. The <span class="t8">Tale of a Tub</span> is so much superiour to his other writings, that one can hardly believe he was the authour of it: &lsquo;there is in it such a vigour of mind, such a swarm of thoughts, so much of nature, and art, and life.&rsquo; I wondered to hear him say of <span class="t8">Gulliver&rsquo;s Travels</span>, &lsquo;When once you have thought of big men and little men, it is very easy to do all the rest.&rsquo; I endeavoured to make a stand for Swift, and tried to rouse those who were much more able to defend him; but in vain. Johnson at last, of his own accord, allowed very great merit to the inventory of articles found in the pocket of the Man Mountain, particularly the description of his watch, which it was conjectured was his GOD, as he consulted it upon all occasions. He observed, that &lsquo;Swift put his name to but two things, (after he had a name to put,) <span class="t8">The Plan for the Improvement of the English Language</span>, and the last <span class="t8">Drapier&rsquo;s Letter</span>.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">From Swift, there was an easy transition to Mr. Thomas Sheridan. &mdash; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sheridan is a wonderful admirer of the tragedy of <span class="t8">Douglas</span>, and presented its authour with a gold medal. Some years ago, at a coffee-house in Oxford, I called to him, &ldquo;Mr. Sheridan, Mr. Sheridan, how came you to give a gold medal to Home, for writing that foolish play?&rdquo; This, you see, was wanton and insolent; but I <span class="t8">meant</span> to be wanton and insolent. A medal has no value but as a stamp of merit. And was Sheridan to assume to himself the right of giving that stamp? If Sheridan was magnificent enough to bestow a gold medal as an honorary reward of dramatick excellence, he should have requested one of the Universities to choose the person on whom it should be conferred. Sheridan had no right to give a stamp of merit: it was counterfeiting Apollo&rsquo;s coin.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Monday, March 27, I breakfasted with him at Mr. Strahan&rsquo;s. He told us, that he was engaged to go that evening to Mrs. Abington&rsquo;s benefit. &lsquo;She was visiting some ladies whom I was visiting, and begged that I would come to her benefit. I told her I could not hear: but she insisted so much on my coming, that it would have been brutal to have refused her.&rsquo; This was a speech quite characteristical. He loved to bring forward his having been in the gay circles of life; and he was, perhaps, a little vain of the solicitations of this elegant and fashionable actress. He told us, the play was to be <span class="t8">The Hypocrite</span>, altered from Cibber&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Nonjuror</span>, so as to satirize the Methodists. &lsquo;I do not think (said he,) the character of <span class="t8">The Hypocrite</span> justly applicable to the Methodists, but it was very applicable to the Nonjurors. I once said to Dr. Madan, a clergyman of Ireland, who was a great Whig, that perhaps a Nonjuror would have been less criminal in taking the oaths imposed by the ruling power, than refusing them; because refusing them, necessarily laid him under almost an irresistible temptation to be more criminal; for, a man <span class="t8">must</span> live, and if he precludes himself from the support furnished by the establishment, will probably be reduced to very wicked shifts to maintain himself.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;I should think, Sir, that a man who took the oaths contrary to his principles, was a determined wicked man, because he was sure he was committing perjury; whereas a Nonjuror might be insensibly led to do what was wrong, without being so directly conscious of it.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, a man who goes to bed to his patron&rsquo;s wife is pretty sure that he is committing wickedness.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Did the nonjuring clergymen do so, Sir?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;I am afraid many of them did.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I was startled at his argument, and could by no means think it convincing. Had not his own father complied with the requisition of government, (as to which he once observed to me, when I pressed him upon it, &lsquo;<span class="t8">That</span>, Sir, he was to settle with himself,&rsquo;) he would probably have thought more unfavourably of a Jacobite who took the oaths:</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo; &mdash; had he not resembled My father as he <span class="t8">swore</span> &mdash; .&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Mr. Strahan talked of launching into the great ocean of London, in order to have a chance for rising into eminence; and, observing that many men were kept back from trying their fortunes there, because they were born to a competency, said, &lsquo;Small certainties are the bane of men of talents;&rsquo; which Johnson confirmed. Mr. Strahan put Johnson in mind of a remark which he had made to him; &lsquo;There are few ways in which a man can be more innocently employed than in getting money.&rsquo; &lsquo;The more one thinks of this, (said Strahan,) the juster it will appear.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Mr. Strahan had taken a poor boy from the country as an apprentice, upon Johnson&rsquo;s recommendation. Johnson having enquired after him, said, &lsquo;Mr. Strahan, let me have five guineas on account, and I&rsquo;ll give this boy one. Nay, if a man recommends a boy, and does nothing for him, it is sad work. Call him down.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I followed him into the court-yard, behind Mr. Strahan&rsquo;s house; and there I had a proof of what I had heard him profess, that he talked alike to all. &lsquo;Some people tell you that they let themselves down to the capacity of their hearers. I never do that. I speak uniformly, in as intelligible a manner as I can.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Well, my boy, how do you go on?&rsquo; &lsquo;Pretty well, Sir; but they are afraid I an&rsquo;t strong enough for some parts of the business.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why I shall be sorry for it; for when you consider with how little mental power and corporeal labour a printer can get a guinea a week, it is a very desirable occupation for you. Do you hear, &mdash; take all the pains you can; and if this does not do, we must think of some other way of life for you. There&rsquo;s a guinea.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Here was one of the many, many instances of his active benevolence. At the same time, the slow and sonorous solemnity with which, while he bent himself down, he addressed a little thick short-legged boy, contrasted with the boy&rsquo;s aukwardness and awe, could not but excite some ludicrous emotions.</p>
<p class="p24">I met him at Drury-lane play-house in the evening. Sir Joshua Reynolds, at Mrs. Abington&rsquo;s request, had promised to bring a body of wits to her benefit; and having secured forty places in the front boxes, had done me the honour to put me in the group. Johnson sat on the seat directly behind me; and as he could neither see nor hear at such a distance from the stage, he was wrapped up in grave abstraction, and seemed quite a cloud, amidst all the sunshine of glitter and gaiety.</p>
<p class="p24">I wondered at his patience in sitting out a play of five acts, and a farce of two. He said very little; but after the prologue to Bon Ton had been spoken, which he could hear pretty well from the more slow and distinct utterance, he talked of prologue-writing, and observed, &lsquo;Dryden has written prologues superiour to any that David Garrick has written; but David Garrick has written more good prologues than Dryden has done. It is wonderful that he has been able to write such variety of them.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">At Mr. Beauclerk&rsquo;s, where I supped, was Mr. Garrick, whom I made happy with Johnson&rsquo;s praise of his prologues; and I suppose, in gratitude to him, he took up one of his favourite topicks, the nationality of the Scotch, which he maintained in a pleasant manner, with the aid of a little poetical fiction. &lsquo;Come, come, don&rsquo;t deny it: they are really national. Why, now, the Adams are as liberal-minded men as any in the world: but, I don&rsquo;t know how it is, all their workmen are Scotch. You are, to be sure, wonderfully free from that nationality: but so it happens, that you employ the only Scotch shoe-black in London.&rsquo; He imitated the manner of his old master with ludicrous exaggeration; repeating, with pauses and half-whistlings interjected,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;<span class="t8">Os homini sublime dedit, &mdash; calumque tueri Jussit, &mdash; et erectos ad sidera &mdash; tollere vultus</span>&rsquo;;</p>
<p class="p24">looking downwards all the time, and, while pronouncing the four last words, absolutely touching the ground with a kind of contorted gesticulation.</p>
<p class="p24">Garrick, however, when he pleased, could imitate Johnson very exactly; for that great actor, with his distinguished powers of expression which were so universally admired, possessed also an admirable talent of mimickry. He was always jealous that Johnson spoke lightly of him. I recollect his exhibiting him to me one day, as if saying, &lsquo;Davy has some convivial pleasantry about him, but &rsquo;tis a futile fellow;&rsquo; which he uttered perfectly with the tone and air of Johnson.</p>
<p class="p24">I cannot too frequently request of my readers, while they peruse my account of Johnson&rsquo;s conversation, to endeavour to keep in mind his deliberate and strong utterance. His mode of speaking was indeed very impressive; and I wish it could be preserved as musick is written, according to the very ingenious method of Mr. Steele, who has shown how the recitation of Mr. Garrick, and other eminent speakers, might be transmitted to posterity in score.</p>
<p class="p24">Next day I dined with Johnson at Mr. Thrale&rsquo;s. He attacked Gray, calling him &lsquo;a dull fellow.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;I understand he was reserved, and might appear dull in company; but surely he was not dull in poetry.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, he was dull in company, dull in his closet, dull every where. He was dull in a new way, and that made many people think him GREAT. He was a mechanical poet.&rsquo; He then repeated some ludicrous lines, which have escaped my memory, and said, &lsquo;Is not that GREAT, like his Odes?&rsquo; Mrs. Thrale maintained that his Odes were melodious; upon which he exclaimed,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Weave the warp, and weave the woof;&rsquo; &mdash; I added, in a solemn tone,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The winding-sheet of Edward&rsquo;s race.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;<span class="t8">There</span> is a good line.&rsquo; &lsquo;Ay, (said he), and the next line is a good one,&rsquo; (pronouncing it contemptuously;) &lsquo;Give ample verge and room enough.&rsquo; &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;No, Sir, there are but two good stanzas in Gray&rsquo;s poetry, which are in his <span class="t8">Elegy in a Country Church-yard</span>.&rsquo; He then repeated the stanza,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;For who to dumb forgetfulness a prey,&rsquo; &amp;c.</p>
<p class="p24">mistaking one word; for instead of <span class="t8">precincts</span> he said <span class="t8">confines</span>. He added, &lsquo;The other stanza I forget.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">A young lady who had married a man much her inferiour in rank being mentioned, a question arose how a woman&rsquo;s relations should behave to her in such a situation; and, while I recapitulate the debate, and recollect what has since happened, I cannot but be struck in a manner that delicacy forbids me to express. While I contended that she ought to be treated with an inflexible steadiness of displeasure, Mrs. Thrale was all for mildness and forgiveness, and, according to the vulgar phrase, &lsquo;making the best of a bad bargain.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Madam, we must distinguish. Were I a man of rank, I would not let a daughter starve who had made a mean marriage; but having voluntarily degraded herself from the station which she was originally entitled to hold, I would support her only in that which she herself had chosen; and would not put her on a level with my other daughters. You are to consider, Madam, that it is our duty to maintain the subordination of civilized society; and when there is a gross and shameful deviation from rank, it should be punished so as to deter others from the same perversion.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">After frequently considering this subject, I am more and more confirmed in what I then meant to express, and which was sanctioned by the authority, and illustrated by the wisdom, of Johnson; and I think it of the utmost consequence to the happiness of Society, to which subordination is absolutely necessary. It is weak, and contemptible, and unworthy, in a parent to relax in such a case. It is sacrificing general advantage to private feelings. And let it be considered, that the claim of a daughter who has acted thus, to be restored to her former situation, is either fantastical or unjust. If there be no value in the distinction of rank, what does she suffer by being kept in the situation to which she has descended? If there be a value in that distinction, it ought to be steadily maintained. If indulgence be shewn to such conduct, and the offenders know that in a longer or shorter time they shall be received as well as if they had not contaminated their blood by a base alliance, the great check upon that inordinate caprice which generally occasions low marriages will be removed, and the fair and comfortable order of improved life will be miserably disturbed.</p>
<p class="p24">Lord Chesterfield&rsquo;s Letters being mentioned, Johnson said, &lsquo;It was not to be wondered at that they had so great a sale, considering that they were the letters of a statesman, a wit, one who had been so much in the mouths of mankind, one long accustomed <span class="t8">vir√ªm volitare per ora</span>.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Friday, March 31, I supped with him and some friends at a tavern. One of the company attempted, with too much forwardness, to rally him on his late appearance at the theatre; but had reason to repent of his temerity. &lsquo;Why, Sir, did you go to Mrs. Abington&rsquo;s benefit? Did you see?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;No, Sir.&rsquo; &lsquo;Did you hear?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;No, Sir.&rsquo; &lsquo;Why then, Sir, did you go?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Because, Sir, she is a favourite of the publick; and when the publick cares the thousandth part for you that it does for her, I will go to your benefit too.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Next morning I won a small bet from lady Diana Beauclerk, by asking him as to one of his particularities, which her Ladyship laid I durst not do. It seems he had been frequently observed at the Club to put into his pocket the Seville oranges, after he had squeezed the juice of them into the drink which he made for himself. Beauclerk and Garrick talked of it to me, and seemed to think that he had a strange unwillingness to be discovered. We could not divine what he did with them; and this was the bold question to be put. I saw on his table the spoils of the preceding night, some fresh peels nicely scraped and cut into pieces. &lsquo;O, Sir, (said I,) I now partly see what you do with the squeezed oranges which you put into your pocket at the Club.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;I have a great love for them.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;And pray, Sir, what do you do with them? You scrape them, it seems, very neatly, and what next?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Let them dry, Sir.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;And what next?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Nay, Sir, you shall know their fate no further.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Then the world must be left in the dark. It must be said (assuming a mock solemnity,) he scraped them, and let them dry, but what he did with them next, he never could be prevailed upon to tell.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Nay, Sir, you should say it more emphatically: &mdash; he could not be prevailed upon, even by his dearest friends, to tell.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He had this morning received his Diploma as Doctor of Laws from the University of Oxford. He did not vaunt of his new dignity, but I understood he was highly pleased with it. I shall here insert the progress and completion of that high academical honour, in the same manner as I have traced his obtaining that of Master of Arts.</p>
<p class="p26">To the Reverend Dr. FOTHERGILL, Vice-Chancellor of the University of<br/>Oxford, to be communicated to the Heads of Houses, and proposed in<br/>Convocation.</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">&lsquo;MR. VICE-CHANCELLOR AND GENTLEMEN,</span></p>
<p class="p21">&lsquo;The honour of the degree of M.A. by diploma, formerly conferred upon MR. SAMUEL JOHNSON, in consequence of his having eminently distinguished himself by the publication of a series of Essays, excellently calculated to form the manners of the people, and in which the cause of religion and morality has been maintained and recommended by the strongest powers of argument and elegance of language, reflected an equal degree of lustre upon the University itself.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The many learned labours which have since that time employed the attention and displayed the abilities of that great man, so much to the advancement of literature and the benefit of the community, render him worthy of more distinguished honours in the Republick of letters: and I persuade myself, that I shall act agreeably to the sentiments of the whole University, in desiring that it may be proposed in Convocation to confer on him the degree of Doctor in Civil Law by diploma, to which I readily give my consent; and am,</p>

<p class="p24">&lsquo;MULTIS non est opus, ut testimonium quo, te praeside, Oxonienses nomen meum posteris commend√¢runt, quali animo acceperim compertum faciam. Nemo sibi placens non laetatur; nemo sibi non placet, qui vobis, literarum arbitris, placere potuit. Hoc tamen habet incommodi tantum beneficium, quod mihi nunquam posth√¢c sine vestrae famae detrimento vel labi liceat vel cessare; semperque sit timendum, ne quod mihi tam eximiae laudi est, vobis aliquando fiat opprobrio.

<p class="p24">&lsquo;7 Id. Apr., 1775.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He revised some sheets of Lord Hailes&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Annals of Scotland</span>, and wrote a few notes on the margin with red ink, which he bade me tell his Lordship did not sink into the paper, and might be wiped off with a wet sponge, so that he did not spoil his manuscript. I observed to him that there were very few of his friends so accurate as that I could venture to put down in writing what they told me as his sayings. Johnson. &lsquo;Why should you write down my sayings?&rsquo; Boswell. &lsquo;I write them when they are good.&rsquo; Johnson. &lsquo;Nay, you may as well write down the sayings of any one else that are good.&rsquo; But <span class="t8">where</span>, I might with great propriety have added, can I find such?</p>
<p class="p24">I visited him by appointment in the evening, and we drank tea with Mrs. Williams. He told me that he had been in the company of a gentleman whose extraordinary travels had been much the subject of conversation. But I found that he had not listened to him with that full confidence, without which there is little satisfaction in the society of travellers. I was curious to hear what opinion so able a judge as Johnson had formed of his abilities, and I asked if he was not a man of sense. Johnson. &lsquo;Why, Sir, he is not a distinct relater; and I should say, he is neither abounding nor deficient in sense. I did not perceive any superiority of understanding.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;But will you not allow him a nobleness of resolution, in penetrating into distant regions?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;That, Sir, is not to the present purpose. We are talking of his sense. A fighting cock has a nobleness of resolution.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Next day, Sunday, April 2, I dined with him at Mr. Hoole&rsquo;s. We talked of Pope. JOHNSON. &lsquo;He wrote his <span class="t8">Dunciad</span> for fame. That was his primary motive. Had it not been for that, the dunces might have railed against him till they were weary, without his troubling himself about them. He delighted to vex them, no doubt; but he had more delight in seeing how well he could vex them.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">The <span class="t8">Odes to Obscurity and Oblivion</span>, in ridicule of &lsquo;cool Mason and warm Gray,&rsquo; being mentioned, Johnson said, &lsquo;They are Colman&rsquo;s best things.&rsquo; Upon its being observed that it was believed these Odes were made by Colman and Lloyd jointly; &mdash; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Nay, Sir, how can two people make an Ode? Perhaps one made one of them, and one the other.&rsquo; I observed that two people had made a play, and quoted the anecdote of Beaumont and Fletcher, who were brought under suspicion of treason, because while concerting the plan of a tragedy when sitting together at a tavern, one of them was overheard saying to the other, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll kill the King.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;The first of these Odes is the best: but they are both good. They exposed a very bad kind of writing.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Surely, Sir, Mr. Mason&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Elfrida</span> is a fine Poem: at least you will allow there are some good passages in it.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;There are now and then some good imitations of Milton&rsquo;s bad manner.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I often wondered at his low estimation of the writings of Gray and Mason. Of Gray&rsquo;s poetry I have in a former part of this work expressed my high opinion; and for that of Mr. Mason I have ever entertained a warm admiration. His <span class="t8">Elfrida</span> is exquisite, both in poetical description and moral sentiment; and his <span class="t8">Caractacus</span> is a noble drama. Nor can I omit paying my tribute of praise to some of his smaller poems, which I have read with pleasure, and which no criticism shall persuade me not to like. If I wondered at Johnson&rsquo;s not tasting the works of Mason and Gray, still more have I wondered at their not tasting his works; that they should be insensible to his energy of diction, to his splendour of images, and comprehension of thought. Tastes may differ as to the violin, the flute, the hautboy, in short all the lesser instruments: but who can be insensible to the powerful impressions of the majestick organ?</p>
<p class="p24">His <span class="t8">Taxation no Tyranny</span> being mentioned, he said, &lsquo;I think I have not been attacked enough for it. Attack is the re-action; I never think I have hit hard, unless it rebounds.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know, Sir, what you would be at. Five or six shots of small arms in every newspaper, and repeated cannonading in pamphlets, might, I think, satisfy you. But, Sir, you&rsquo;ll never make out this match, of which we have talked, with a certain, political lady, since you are so severe against her principles.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Nay, Sir, I have the better chance for that. She is like the Amazons of old; she must be courted by the sword. But I have not been severe upon her.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Yes, Sir, you have made her ridiculous.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;That was already done, Sir. To endeavour to make <span class="t8">her</span> ridiculous, is like blacking the chimney.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I put him in mind that the landlord at Ellon in Scotland said, that he heard he was the greatest man in England, &mdash; next to Lord Mansfield. &lsquo;Ay, Sir, (said he,) the exception defined the idea. A Scotchman could go no farther:</p>
<p class="p24">&ldquo;The force of Nature could no farther go.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Lady Miller&rsquo;s collection of verses by fashionable people, which were put into her Vase at Batheaston villa, near Bath, in competition for honorary prizes, being mentioned, he held them very cheap: &lsquo;<span class="t8">Bouts rim√©s</span> (said he,) is a mere conceit, and an <span class="t8">old</span> conceit now, I wonder how people were persuaded to write in that manner for this lady.&rsquo; I named a gentleman of his acquaintance who wrote for the Vase. JOHNSON. &lsquo;He was a blockhead for his pains.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;The Duchess of Northumberland wrote.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, the Duchess of Northumberland may do what she pleases: nobody will say anything to a lady of her high rank. But I should be apt to throw &mdash; &mdash; &lsquo;s verses in his face.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I talked of the chearfulness of Fleet-street, owing to the constant quick succession of people which we perceive passing through it. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, Fleet-street has a very animated appearance; but I think the full tide of human existence is at Charing-cross.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He made the common remark on the unhappiness which men who have led a busy life experience, when they retire in expectation of enjoying themselves at ease, and that they generally languish for want of their habitual occupation, and wish to return to it. He mentioned as strong an instance of this as can well be imagined. &lsquo;An eminent tallow-chandler in London, who had acquired a considerable fortune, gave up the trade in favour of his foreman, and went to live at a country-house near town. He soon grew weary, and paid frequent visits to his old shop, where he desired they might let him know their <span class="t8">melting-days</span>, and he would come and assist them; which he accordingly did. Here, Sir, was a man, to whom the most disgusting circumstance in the business to which he had been used was a relief from idleness.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Wednesday, April 5, I dined with him at Messieurs Dilly&rsquo;s, with Mr. John Scott of Amwell, the Quaker, Mr. Langton, Mr. Miller, (now Sir John,) and Dr. Thomas Campbell, an Irish Clergyman, whom I took the liberty of inviting to Mr. Billy&rsquo;s table, having seen him at Mr. Thrale&rsquo;s, and been told that he had come to England chiefly with a view to see Dr. Johnson, for whom he entertained the highest veneration. He has since published <span class="t8">A Philosophical Survey of the South of Ireland</span>, a very entertaining book, which has, however, one fault; &mdash; that it assumes the fictitious character of an Englishman.</p>
<p class="p24">We talked of publick speaking. &mdash; JOHNSON. &lsquo;We must not estimate a man&rsquo;s powers by his being able or not able to deliver his sentiments in publick. Isaac Hawkins Browne, one of the first wits of this country, got into Parliament, and never opened his mouth. For my own part, I think it is more disgraceful never to try to speak, than to try it and fail; as it is more disgraceful not to fight, than to fight and be beaten.&rsquo; This argument appeared to me fallacious; for if a man has not spoken, it may be said that he would have done very well if he had tried; whereas, if he has tried and failed, there is nothing to be said for him. &lsquo;Why then, (I asked,) is it thought disgraceful for a man not to fight, and not disgraceful not to speak in publick?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Because there may be other reasons for a man&rsquo;s not speaking in publick than want of resolution: he may have nothing to say, (laughing.) Whereas, Sir, you know courage is reckoned the greatest of all virtues; because, unless a man has that virtue, he has no security for preserving any other.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He observed, that &lsquo;the statutes against bribery were intended to prevent upstarts with money from getting into Parliament;&rsquo; adding, that &lsquo;if he were a gentleman of landed property, he would turn out all his tenants who did not vote for the candidate whom he supported.&rsquo; LANGTON. &lsquo;Would not that, Sir, be checking the freedom of election?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, the law does not mean that the privilege of voting should be independent of old family interest; of the permanent property of the country.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p26">On Thursday, April 6, I dined with him at Mr. Thomas Davies&rsquo;s, with Mr.<br/>Hicky, the painter, and my old acquaintance Mr. Moody, the player.</p>
<p class="p24">Dr. Johnson, as usual, spoke contemptuously of Colley Cibber. &lsquo;It is wonderful that a man, who for forty years had lived with the great and the witty, should have acquired so ill the talents of conversation: and he had but half to furnish; for one half of what he said was oaths.&rsquo; He, however, allowed considerable merit to some of his comedies, and said there was no reason to believe that the <span class="t8">Careless Husband</span> was not written by himself. Davies said, he was the first dramatick writer who introduced genteel ladies upon the stage. Johnson refuted this observation by instancing several such characters in comedies before his time. DAVIES (trying to defend himself from a charge of ignorance,) &lsquo;I mean genteel moral characters.&rsquo; &lsquo;I think (said Hicky,) gentility and morality are inseparable.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;By no means, Sir. The genteelest characters are often the most immoral. Does not Lord Chesterfield give precepts for uniting wickedness and the graces? A man, indeed, is not genteel when he gets drunk; but most vices may be committed very genteelly: a man may debauch his friend&rsquo;s wife genteely: he may cheat at cards genteelly.&rsquo; HICKY. &lsquo;I do not think <span class="t8">that</span> is genteel.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Sir, it may not be like a gentleman, but it may be genteel.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;You are meaning two different things. One means exteriour grace; the other honour. It is certain that a man may be very immoral with exteriour grace. Lovelace, in <span class="t8">Clarissa</span>, is a very genteel and a very wicked character. Tom Hervey, who died t&rsquo;other day, though a vicious man, was one of the genteelest men that ever lived.&rsquo; Tom Davies instanced Charles the Second. JOHNSON, (taking fire at any attack upon that Prince, for whom he had an extraordinary partiality,) &lsquo;Charles the Second was licentious in his practice; but he always had a reverence for what was good. Charles the Second knew his people, and rewarded merit. The Church was at no time better filled than in his reign. He was the best King we have had from his time till the reign of his present Majesty, except James the Second, who was a very good King, but unhappily believed that it was necessary for the salvation of his subjects that they should be Roman Catholicks. <span class="t8">He</span> had the merit of endeavouring to do what he thought was for the salvation of the souls of his subjects, till he lost a great Empire. <span class="t8">We</span>, who thought that we should <span class="t8">not</span> be saved if we were Roman Catholicks, had the merit of maintaining our religion, at the experience of submitting ourselves to the government of King William, (for it could not be done otherwise,) &mdash; to the government of one of the most worthless scoundrels that ever existed. No; Charles the Second was not such a man as &mdash;&mdash; , (naming another King). He did not destroy his father&rsquo;s will. He took money, indeed, from France: but he did not betray those over whom he ruled: He did not let the French fleet pass ours. George the First knew nothing, and desired to know nothing; did nothing, and desired to do nothing: and the only good thing that is told of him is, that he wished to restore the crown to its hereditary successor.&rsquo; He roared with prodigious violence against George the Second. When he ceased, Moody interjected, in an Irish tone, and with a comick look, &lsquo;Ah! poor George the Second.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I mentioned that Dr. Thomas Campbell had come from Ireland to London, principally to see Dr. Johnson. He seemed angry at this observation. DAVIES. &lsquo;Why, you know, Sir, there came a man from Spain to see Livy; and Corelli came to England to see Purcell, and when he heard he was dead, went directly back again to Italy.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;I should not have wished to be dead to disappoint Campbell, had he been so foolish as you represent him; but I should have wished to have been a hundred miles off.&rsquo; This was apparently perverse; and I do believe it was not his real way of thinking: he could not but like a man who came so far to see him. He laughed with some complacency, when I told him Campbell&rsquo;s odd expression to me concerning him: &lsquo;That having seen such a man, was a thing to talk of a century hence,&rsquo; &mdash; as if he could live so long.</p>
<p class="p24">We got into an argument whether the Judges who went to India might with propriety engage in trade. Johnson warmly maintained that they might. &lsquo;For why (he urged) should not Judges get riches, as well as those who deserve them less?&rsquo; I said, they should have sufficient salaries, and have nothing to take off their attention from the affairs of the publick. JOHNSON. &lsquo;No Judge, Sir, can give his whole attention to his office; and it is very proper that he should employ what time he has to himself, to his own advantage, in the most profitable manner.&rsquo; &lsquo;Then, Sir, (said Davies, who enlivened the dispute by making it somewhat dramatick,) he may become an insurer; and when he is going to the bench, he may be stopped,&mdash; &ldquo;Your Lordship cannot go yet: here is a bunch of invoices: several ships are about to sail.&rdquo;&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, you may as well say a Judge should not have a house; for they may come and tell him, &ldquo;Your Lordship&rsquo;s house is on fire;&rdquo; and so, instead of minding the business of his Court, he is to be occupied in getting the engine with the greatest speed. There is no end of this. Every Judge who has land, trades to a certain extent in corn or in cattle; and in the land itself, undoubtedly. His steward acts for him, and so do clerks for a great merchant. A Judge may be a farmer; but he is not to geld his own pigs. A Judge may play a little at cards for his amusement; but he is not to play at marbles, or at chuck-farthing in the Piazza. No, Sir; there is no profession to which a man gives a very great proportion of his time. It is wonderful, when a calculation is made, how little the mind is actually employed in the discharge of any profession. No man would be a Judge, upon the condition of being totally a Judge. The best employed lawyer has his mind at work but for a small proportion of his time: a great deal of his occupation is merely mechanical. I once wrote for a magazine: I made a calculation, that if I should write but a page a day, at the same rate, I should, in ten years, write nine volumes in folio, of an ordinary size and print.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Such as Carte&rsquo;s <span class="t8">History</span>?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Yes, Sir. When a man writes from his own mind, he writes very rapidly. The greatest part of a writer&rsquo;s time is spent in reading, in order to write: a man will turn over half a library to make one book.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I argued warmly against the Judges trading, and mentioned Hale as an instance of a perfect Judge, who devoted himself entirely to his office. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Hale, Sir, attended to other things besides law: he left a great estate.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;That was, because what he got, accumulated without any exertion and anxiety on his part.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">While the dispute went on, Moody once tried to say something upon our side. Tom Davies clapped him on the back, to encourage him. Beauclerk, to whom I mentioned this circumstance, said, &lsquo;that he could not conceive a more humiliating situation than to be clapped on the back by Tom Davies.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">We spoke of Rolt, to whose <span class="t8">Dictionary of Commerce</span> Dr. Johnson wrote the Preface. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Old Gardner the bookseller employed Rolt and Smart to write a monthly miscellany, called <span class="t8">The Universal Visitor</span>. There was a formal written contract, which Allen the printer saw. Gardner thought as you do of the Judge. They were bound to write nothing else; they were to have, I think, a third of the profits of this sixpenny pamphlet; and the contract was for ninety-nine years. I wish I had thought of giving this to Thurlow, in the cause about Literary Property. What an excellent instance would it have been of the oppression of booksellers towards poor authours!&rsquo; (smiling)! Davies, zealous for the honour of <span class="t8">the Trade</span>, said, Gardner was not properly a bookseller. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Nay, Sir; he certainly was a bookseller. He had served his time regularly, was a member of the Stationers&rsquo; company, kept a shop in the face of mankind, purchased copyright, and was a <span class="t8">bibliopole</span>, Sir, in every sense. I wrote for some months in <span class="t8">The Universal Visitor</span>, for poor Smart, while he was mad, not then knowing the terms on which he was engaged to write, and thinking I was doing him good. I hoped his wits would soon return to him. Mine returned to me, and I wrote in <span class="t8">The Universal Visitor</span> no longer.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Friday, April 7, I dined with him at a Tavern, with a numerous company. JOHNSON. &lsquo;I have been reading Twiss&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Travels in Spain</span>, which are just come out. They are as good as the first book of travels that you will take up. They are as good as those of Keysler or Blainville; nay, as Addison&rsquo;s, if you except the learning. They are not so good as Brydone&rsquo;s, but they are better than Pococke&rsquo;s. I have not, indeed, cut the leaves yet; but I have read in them where the pages are open, and I do not suppose that what is in the pages which are closed is worse than what is in the open pages. It would seem (he added,) that Addison had not acquired much Italian learning, for we do not find it introduced into his writings. The only instance that I recollect, is his quoting &ldquo;<span class="t8">Stavo bene; per star meglio, sto qui</span>.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I mentioned Addison&rsquo;s having borrowed many of his classical remarks from Leandro Alberti. Mr. Beauclerk said, &lsquo;It was alledged that he had borrowed also from another Italian authour.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, all who go to look for what the Classicks have said of Italy, must find the same passages; and I should think it would be one of the first things the Italians would do on the revival of learning, to collect all that the Roman authors have said of their country.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Ossian being mentioned; &mdash; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Supposing the Irish and Erse languages to be the same, which I do not believe, yet as there is no reason to suppose that the inhabitants of the Highlands and Hebrides ever wrote their native language, it is not to be credited that a long poem was preserved among them. If we had no evidence of the art of writing being practised in one of the counties of England, we should not believe that a long poem was preserved <span class="t8">there</span>, though in the neighbouring counties, where the same language was spoken, the inhabitants could write.&rsquo; BEAUCLERK. &lsquo;The ballad of <span class="t8">Lilliburlero</span> was once in the mouths of all the people of this country, and is said to have had a great effect in bringing about the Revolution. Yet I question whether any body can repeat it now; which shews how improbable it is that much poetry should be preserved by tradition.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">One of the company suggested an internal objection to the antiquity of the poetry said to be Ossian&rsquo;s, that we do not find the wolf in it, which must have been the case had it been of that age.</p>
<p class="p24">The mention of the wolf had led Johnson to think of other wild beasts; and while Sir Joshua Reynolds and Mr. Langton were carrying on a dialogue about something which engaged them earnestly, he, in the midst of it, broke out, &lsquo;Pennant tells of Bears&mdash; &lsquo;[what he added, I have forgotten.] They went on, which he being dull of hearing, did not perceive, or, if he did, was not willing to break off his talk; so he continued to vociferate his remarks, and <span class="t8">Bear</span> (&lsquo;like a word in a catch&rsquo; as Beauclerk said,) was repeatedly heard at intervals, which coming from him who, by those who did not know him, had been so often assimilated to that ferocious animal, while we who were sitting around could hardly stifle laughter, produced a very ludicrous effect. Silence having ensued, he proceeded: &lsquo;We are told, that the black bear is innocent; but I should not like to trust myself with him.&rsquo; Mr. Gibbon muttered, in a low tone of voice. &lsquo;I should not like to trust myself with <span class="t8">you</span>.&rsquo; This piece of sarcastick pleasantry was a prudent resolution, if applied to a competition of abilities.</p>
<p class="p24">Patriotism having become one of our topicks, Johnson suddenly uttered, in a strong determined tone, an apophthegm, at which many will start: &lsquo;Patriotism is the last refuge of a scoundrel.&rsquo; But let it be considered, that he did not mean a real and generous love of our country, but that pretended patriotism which so many, in all ages and countries, have made a cloak for self-interest. I maintain, that certainly all patriots were not scoundrels. Being urged, (not by Johnson) to name one exception, I mentioned an eminent person, whom we all greatly admired. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, I do not say that he is <span class="t8">not</span> honest; but we have no reason to conclude from his political conduct that he <span class="t8">is</span> honest. Were he to accept of a place from this ministry, he would lose that character of firmness which he has, and might be turned out of his place in a year. This ministry is neither stable, nor grateful to their friends, as Sir Robert Walpole was, so that he may think it more for his interest to take his chance of his party coming in.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Mrs. Prichard being mentioned, he said, &lsquo;Her playing was quite mechanical. It is wonderful how little mind she had. Sir, she had never read the tragedy of <span class="t8">Macbeth</span> all through. She no more thought of the play out of which her part was taken, than a shoemaker thinks of the skin, out of which the piece of leather, of which he is making a pair of shoes, is cut.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Saturday, May 8, I dined with him at Mr. Thrale&rsquo;s, where we met the Irish Dr. Campbell. Johnson had supped the night before at Mrs. Abington&rsquo;s, with some fashionable people whom he named; and he seemed much pleased with having made one in so elegant a circle. Nor did he omit to pique his <span class="t8">mistress</span> a little with jealousy of her housewifery; for he said, (with a smile,) &lsquo;Mrs. Abington&rsquo;s jelly, my dear Lady, was better than yours.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Mrs. Thrale, who frequently practised a coarse mode of flattery, by repeating his <span class="t8">bon-mots</span> in his hearing, told us that he had said, a certain celebrated actor was just fit to stand at the door of an auction-room with a long pole, and cry &lsquo;Pray gentlemen, walk in;&rsquo; and that a certain authour, upon hearing this, had said, that another still more celebrated actor was fit for nothing better than that, and would pick your pocket after you came out. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Nay, my dear lady, there is no wit in what our friend added; there is only abuse. You may as well say of any man that he will pick a pocket. Besides, the man who is stationed at the door does not pick people&rsquo;s pockets; that is done within, by the auctioneer.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Mrs. Thrale told us, that Tom Davies repeated, in a very bald manner, the story of Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s first repartee to me, which I have related exactly. He made me say, &lsquo;I was <span class="t8">born</span> in Scotland,&rsquo; instead of &lsquo;I <span class="t8">come from</span> Scotland;&rsquo; so that Johnson saying, &lsquo;That, Sir, is what a great many of your countrymen cannot help,&rsquo; had no point, or even meaning: and that upon this being mentioned to Mr. Fitzherbert, he observed, &lsquo;It is not every man that can <span class="t8">carry</span> a <span class="t8">bon mot</span>.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Monday, April 10, I dined with him at General Oglethorpe&rsquo;s, with Mr. Langton and the Irish Dr. Campbell, whom the General had obligingly given me leave to bring with me. This learned gentleman was thus gratified with a very high intellectual feast, by not only being in company with Dr. Johnson, but with General Oglethorpe, who had been so long a celebrated name both at home and abroad.</p>
<p class="p24">I must, again and again, intreat of my readers not to suppose that my imperfect record of conversation contains the whole of what was said by Johnson, or other eminent persons who lived with him. What I have preserved, however, has the value of the most perfect authenticity.</p>
<p class="p24">He this day enlarged upon Pope&rsquo;s melancholy remark,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Man never <span class="t8">is</span>, but always <span class="t8">to be</span> blest.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He asserted that <span class="t8">the present</span> was never a happy state to any human being; but that, as every part of life, of which we are conscious, was at some point of time a period yet to come, in which felicity was expected, there was some happiness produced by hope. Being pressed upon this subject, and asked if he really was of opinion, that though, in general, happiness was very rare in human life, a man was not sometimes happy in the moment that was present, he answered, &lsquo;Never, but when he is drunk.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He urged General Oglethorpe to give the world his Life. He said, &lsquo;I know no man whose Life would be more interesting. If I were furnished with materials, I should be very glad to write it.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Mr. Scott of Amwell&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Elegies</span> were lying in the room. Dr. Johnson observed, &lsquo;They are very well; but such as twenty people might write.&rsquo; Upon this I took occasion to controvert Horace&rsquo;s maxim,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo; &mdash; mediocribus esse poetis Non Di, non homines, non concess√©re column√¶.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">For here, (I observed,) was a very middle-rate poet, who pleased many readers, and therefore poetry of a middle sort was entitled to some esteem; nor could I see why poetry should not, like every thing else, have different gradations of excellence, and consequently of value. Johnson repeated the common remark, that, &lsquo;as there is no necessity for our having poetry at all, it being merely a luxury, an instrument of pleasure, it can have no value, unless when exquisite in its kind.&rsquo; I declared myself not satisfied. &lsquo;Why then, Sir, (said he,) Horace and you must settle it.&rsquo; He was not much in the humour of talking.</p>
<p class="p24">No more of his conversation for some days appears in my journal, except that when a gentleman told him he had bought a suit of lace for his lady, he said, &lsquo;Well, Sir, you have done a good thing and a wise thing.&rsquo; &lsquo;I have done a good thing, (said the gentleman,) but I do not know that I have done a wise thing.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Yes, Sir; no money is better spent than what is laid out for domestick satisfaction. A man is pleased that his wife is drest as well as other people; and a wife is pleased that she is drest.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Friday, April 14, being Good-Friday, I repaired to him in the morning, according to my usual custom on that day, and breakfasted with him. I observed that he fasted so very strictly, that he did not even taste bread, and took no milk with his tea; I suppose because it is a kind of animal food.</p>
<p class="p24">He entered upon the state of the nation, and thus discoursed: &lsquo;Sir, the great misfortune now is, that government has too little power. All that it has to bestow must of necessity be given to support itself; so that it cannot reward merit. No man, for instance, can now be made a Bishop for his learning and piety; his only chance for promotion is his being connected with somebody who has parliamentary interest. Our several ministries in this reign have outbid each other in concessions to the people. Lord Bute, though a very honourable man, &mdash; a man who meant well, &mdash; a man who had his blood full of prerogative, &mdash; was a theoretical statesman, &mdash; a book-minister, &mdash; and thought this country could be governed by the influence of the Crown alone. Then, Sir, he gave up a great deal. He advised the King to agree that the Judges should hold their places for life, instead of losing them at the accession of a new King. Lord Bute, I suppose, thought to make the King popular by this concession; but the people never minded it; and it was a most impolitick measure. There is no reason why a Judge should hold his office for life, more than any other person in publick trust. A Judge may be partial otherwise than to the Crown: we have seen Judges partial to the populace. A Judge may become corrupt, and yet there may not be legal evidence against him. A Judge may become froward from age. A Judge may grow unfit for his office in many ways. It was desirable that there should be a possibility of being delivered from him by a new King. That is now gone by an act of Parliament <span class="t8">ex grati√¢</span> of the Crown. Lord Bute advised the King to give up a very large sum of money, for which nobody thanked him. It was of consequence to the King, but nothing to the publick, among whom it was divided. When I say Lord Bute advised, I mean, that such acts were done when he was minister, and we are to suppose that he advised them. &mdash; Lord Bute shewed an undue partiality to Scotchmen. He turned out Dr. Nichols, a very eminent man, from being physician to the King, to make room for one of his countrymen, a man very low in his profession. He had &mdash;&mdash; and &mdash;&mdash; to go on errands for him. He had occasion for people to go on errands for him; but he should not have had Scotchmen; and, certainly, he should not have suffered them to have access to him before the first people in England.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I told him, that the admission of one of them before the first people in England, which had given the greatest offence, was no more than what happens at every minister&rsquo;s levee, where those who attend are admitted in the order that they have come, which is better than admitting them according to their rank; for if that were to be the rule, a man who has waited all the morning might have the mortification to see a peer, newly come, go in before him, and keep him waiting still. JOHNSON. &lsquo;True, Sir; but &mdash;&mdash; should not have come to the levee, to be in the way of people of consequence. He saw Lord Bute at all times; and could have said what he had to say at any time, as well as at the levee. There is now no Prime Minister: there is only an agent for government in the House of Commons. We are governed by the Cabinet: but there is no one head there since Sir Robert Walpole&rsquo;s time.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;What then, Sir, is the use of Parliament?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, Parliament is a larger council to the King; and the advantage of such a council is, having a great number of men of property concerned in the legislature, who, for their own interest, will not consent to bad laws. And you must have observed, Sir, that administration is feeble and timid, and cannot act with that authority and resolution which is necessary. Were I in power, I would turn out every man who dared to oppose me. Government has the distribution of offices, that it may be enabled to maintain its authority.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Lord Bute (he added,) took down too fast, without building up something new.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Because, Sir, he found a rotten building. The political coach was drawn by a set of bad horses: it was necessary to change them.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;But he should have changed them one by one.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I told him that I had been informed by Mr. Orme, that many parts of the East-Indies were better mapped than the Highlands of Scotland. JOHNSON. &lsquo;That a country may be mapped, it must be travelled over.&rsquo; &lsquo;Nay, (said I, meaning to laugh with him at one of his prejudices,) can&rsquo;t you say, it is not <span class="t8">worth</span> mapping?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">As we walked to St. Clement&rsquo;s church, and saw several shops open upon this most solemn fast-day of the Christian world, I remarked, that one disadvantage arising from the immensity of London, was, that nobody was heeded by his neighbour; there was no fear of censure for not observing Good Friday, as it ought to be kept, and as it is kept in country-towns. He said, it was, upon the whole, very well observed even in London. He, however, owned, that London was too large; but added, &lsquo;It is nonsense to say the head is too big for the body. It would be as much too big, though the body were ever so large; that is to say, though the country were ever so extensive. It has no similarity to a head connected with a body.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Dr. Wetherell, Master of University College, Oxford, accompanied us home from church; and after he was gone, there came two other gentlemen, one of whom uttered the common-place complaints, that by the increase of taxes, labour would be dear, other nations would undersell us, and our commerce would be ruined. JOHNSON (smiling). &lsquo;Never fear, Sir. Our commerce is in a very good state; and suppose we had no commerce at all, we could live very well on the produce of our own country.&rsquo; I cannot omit to mention, that I never knew any man who was less disposed to be querulous than Johnson. Whether the subject was his own situation, or the state of the publick, or the state of human nature in general, though he saw the evils, his mind was turned to resolution, and never to whining or complaint.</p>
<p class="p24">We went again to St. Clement&rsquo;s in the afternoon. He had found fault with the preacher in the morning for not choosing a text adapted to the day. The preacher in the afternoon had chosen one extremely proper: &lsquo;It is finished.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">After the evening service, he said, &lsquo;Come, you shall go home with me, and sit just an hour.&rsquo; But he was better than his word; for after we had drunk tea with Mrs. Williams, he asked me to go up to his study with him, where we sat a long while together in a serene undisturbed frame of mind, sometimes in silence, and sometimes conversing, as we felt ourselves inclined, or more properly speaking, as <span class="t8">he</span> was inclined; for during all the course of my long intimacy with him, my respectful attention never abated, and my wish to hear him was such, that I constantly watched every dawning of communication from that great and illuminated mind.</p>
<p class="p24">He observed, &lsquo;All knowledge is of itself of some value. There is nothing so minute or inconsiderable, that I would not rather know it than not. In the same manner, all power, of whatever sort, is of itself desirable. A man would not submit to learn to hem a ruffle, of his wife, or his wife&rsquo;s maid; but if a mere wish could attain it, he would rather wish to be able to hem a ruffle.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He again advised me to keep a journal fully and minutely, but not to mention such trifles as, that meat was too much or too little done, or that the weather was fair or rainy. He had, till very near his death, a contempt for the notion that the weather affects the human frame.</p>
<p class="p24">I told him that our friend Goldsmith had said to me, that he had come too late into the world, for that Pope and other poets had taken up the places in the Temple of Fame; so that, as but a few at any period can possess poetical reputation, a man of genius can now hardly acquire it. JOHNSON. &lsquo;That is one of the most sensible things I have ever heard of Goldsmith. It is difficult to get literary fame, and it is every day growing more difficult. Ah, Sir, that should make a man think of securing happiness in another world, which all who try sincerely for it may attain. In comparison of that, how little are all other things! The belief of immortality is impressed upon all men, and all men act under an impression of it, however they may talk, and though, perhaps, they may be scarcely sensible of it.&rsquo; I said, it appeared to me that some people had not the least notion of immortality; and I mentioned a distinguished gentleman of our acquaintance. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, if it were not for the notion of immortality, he would cut a throat to fill his pockets.&rsquo; When I quoted this to Beauclerk, who knew much more of the gentleman than we did, he said, in his acid manner, &lsquo;He would cut a throat to fill his pockets, if it were not for fear of being hanged.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Dr. Johnson proceeded: &lsquo;Sir, there is a great cry about infidelity; but there are, in reality, very few infidels. I have heard a person, originally a Quaker, but now, I am afraid, a Deist, say, that he did not believe there were, in all England, above two hundred infidels.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He was pleased to say, &lsquo;If you come to settle here, we will have one day in the week on which we will meet by ourselves. That is the happiest conversation where there is no competition, no vanity, but a calm quiet interchange of sentiments.&rsquo; In his private register this evening is thus marked, &lsquo;Boswell sat with me till night; we had some serious talk.&rsquo; It also appears from the same record, that after I left him he was occupied in religious duties, in &lsquo;giving Francis, his servant, some directions for preparation to communicate; in reviewing his life, and resolving on better conduct.&rsquo; The humility and piety which he discovers on such occasions, is truely edifying. No saint, however, in the course of his religious warfare, was more sensible of the unhappy failure of pious resolves, than Johnson. He said one day, talking to an acquaintance on this subject, &lsquo;Sir, Hell is paved with good intentions.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Sunday, April 16, being Easter Day, after having attended the solemn service at St. Paul&rsquo;s, I dined with Dr. Johnson and Mrs. Williams. I maintained that Horace was wrong in placing happiness in <span class="t8">Nil admirari</span>, for that I thought admiration one of the most agreeable of all our feelings; and I regretted that I had lost much of my disposition to admire, which people generally do as they advance in life. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, as a man advances in life, he gets what is better than admiration &mdash; judgement, to estimate things at their true value.&rsquo; I still insisted that admiration was more pleasing than judgement, as love is more pleasing than friendship. The feeling of friendship is like that of being comfortably filled with roast beef; love, like being enlivened with champagne. JOHNSON. &lsquo;No, Sir; admiration and love are like being intoxicated with champagne; judgement and friendship like being enlivened. Waller has hit upon the same thought with you: but I don&rsquo;t believe you have borrowed from Waller. I wish you would enable yourself to borrow more.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He then took occasion to enlarge on the advantages of reading, and combated the idle superficial notion, that knowledge enough may be acquired in conversation. &lsquo;The foundation (said he,) must be laid by reading. General principles must be had from books, which, however, must be brought to the test of real life. In conversation you never get a system. What is said upon a subject is to be gathered from a hundred people. The parts of a truth, which a man gets thus, are at such a distance from each other that he never attains to a full view.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To BENNET LANGTON, ESQ.</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I have enquired more minutely about the medicine for the rheumatism, which I am sorry to hear that you still want. The receipt is this:</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Take equal quantities of flour of sulphur, and <span class="t8">flour</span> of mustard-seed, make them an electuary with honey or treacle; and take a bolus as big as a nutmeg several times a day, as you can bear it: drinking after it a quarter of a pint of the infusion of the root of Lovage.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Lovage, in Ray&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Nomenclature</span>, is Levisticum: perhaps the Botanists may know the Latin name.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Of this medicine I pretend not to judge. There is all the appearance of its efficacy, which a single instance can afford: the patient was very old, the pain very violent, and the relief, I think, speedy and lasting.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;My opinion of alterative medicine is not high, but <span class="t8">quid tentasse nocebit</span>? if it does harm, or does no good, it may be omitted; but that it may do good, you have, I hope, reason to think is desired by,</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;Sir, your most affectionate,<br/>Humble servant,<br/>SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;April 17, 1775.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Tuesday, April 18, he and I were engaged to go with Sir Joshua Reynolds to dine with Mr. Cambridge, at his beautiful villa on the banks of the Thames, near Twickenham. Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s tardiness was such, that Sir Joshua, who had an appointment at Richmond, early in the day, was obliged to go by himself on horseback, leaving his coach to Johnson and me. Johnson was in such good spirits, that every thing seemed to please him as we drove along.</p>
<p class="p24">Our conversation turned on a variety of subjects. He thought portrait-painting an improper employment for a woman. &lsquo;Publick practice of any art, (he observed,) and staring in men&rsquo;s faces, is very indelicate in a female.&rsquo; I happened to start a question, whether, when a man knows that some of his intimate friends are invited to the house of another friend, with whom they are all equally intimate, he may join them without an invitation. JOHNSON. &lsquo;No, Sir; he is not to go when he is not invited. They may be invited on purpose to abuse him&rsquo; (smiling).</p>
<p class="p24">As a curious instance how little a man knows, or wishes to know, his own character in the world, or, rather, as a convincing proof that Johnson&rsquo;s roughness was only external, and did not proceed from his heart, I insert the following dialogue. JOHNSON. &lsquo;It is wonderful, Sir, how rare a quality good humour is in life. We meet with very few good humoured men.&rsquo; I mentioned four of our friends, none of whom he would allow to be good humoured. One was <span class="t8">acid</span>, another was <span class="t8">muddy</span>, and to the others he had objections which have escaped me. Then, shaking his head and stretching himself at ease in the coach, and smiling with much complacency, he turned to me and said, &lsquo;I look upon <span class="t8">myself</span> as a good humoured fellow.&rsquo; The epithet <span class="t8">fellow</span>, applied to the great Lexicographer, the stately Moralist, the masterly Critick, as if he had been Sam Johnson, a mere pleasant companion, was highly diverting; and this light notion of himself struck me with wonder. I answered, also smiling, &lsquo;No, no, Sir; that will <span class="t8">not</span> do. You are good natured, but not good humoured: you are irascible. You have not patience with folly and absurdity. I believe you would pardon them, if there were time to deprecate your vengeance; but punishment follows so quick after sentence, that they cannot escape.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I had brought with me a great bundle of Scotch magazines and news-papers, in which his <span class="t8">Journey to the Western Islands</span> was attacked in every mode; and I read a great part of them to him, knowing they would afford him entertainment. I wish the writers of them had been present: they would have been sufficiently vexed. One ludicrous imitation of his style, by Mr. Maclaurin, now one of the Scotch Judges, with the title of Lord Dreghorn, was distinguished by him from the rude mass. &lsquo;This (said he,) is the best. But I could caricature my own style much better myself.&rsquo; He defended his remark upon the general insufficiency of education in Scotland; and confirmed to me the authenticity of his witty saying on the learning of the Scotch;&mdash; &lsquo;Their learning is like bread in a besieged town: every man gets a little, but no man gets a full meal.&rsquo; &lsquo;There is (said he,) in Scotland, a diffusion of learning, a certain portion of it widely and thinly spread. A merchant there has as much learning as one of their clergy.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He talked of Isaac Walton&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Lives</span>, which was one of his most favourite books. Dr. Donne&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Life</span>, he said, was the most perfect of them. He observed, that &lsquo;it was wonderful that Walton, who was in a very low situation in life, should have been familiarly received by so many great men, and that at a time when the ranks of society were kept more separate than they are now.&rsquo; He supposed that Walton had then given up his business as a linen draper and sempster, and was only an authour; and added, &lsquo;that he was a great panegyrist.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;No quality will get a man more friends than a disposition to admire the qualities of others. I do not mean flattery, but a sincere admiration.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Nay, Sir, flattery pleases very generally. In the first place, the flatterer may think what he says to be true: but, in the second place, whether he thinks so or not, he certainly thinks those whom he flatters of consequence enough to be flattered.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">No sooner had we made our bow to Mr. Cambridge, in his library, than Johnson ran eagerly to one side of the room, intent on poring over the backs of the books. Sir Joshua observed, (aside,) &lsquo;He runs to the books, as I do to the pictures: but I have the advantage. I can see much more of the pictures than he can of the books.&rsquo; Mr. Cambridge, upon this, politely said, &lsquo;Dr. Johnson, I am going, with your pardon, to accuse myself, for I have the same custom which I perceive you have. But it seems odd that one should have such a desire to look at the backs of books.&rsquo; Johnson, ever ready for contest, instantly started from his reverie, wheeled about, and answered, &lsquo;Sir, the reason is very plain. Knowledge is of two kinds. We know a subject ourselves, or we know where we can find information upon it. When we enquire into any subject, the first thing we have to do is to know what books have treated of it. This leads us to look at catalogues, and the backs of books in libraries.&rsquo; Sir Joshua observed to me the extraordinary promptitude with which Johnson flew upon an argument. &lsquo;Yes, (said I,) he has no formal preparation, no flourishing with his sword; he is through your body in an instant.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson was here solaced with an elegant entertainment, a very accomplished family, and much good company; among whom was Mr. Harris of Salisbury, who paid him many compliments on his <span class="t8">Journey to the Western Islands</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">The common remark as to the utility of reading history being made; &mdash; JOHNSON. &lsquo;We must consider how very little history there is; I mean real authentick history. That certain Kings reigned, and certain battles were fought, we can depend upon as true; but all the colouring, all the philosophy of history is conjecture.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Then, Sir, you would reduce all history to no better than an almanack, a mere chronological series of remarkable events.&rsquo; Mr. Gibbon, who must at that time have been employed upon his <span class="t8">History</span>, of which he published the first volume in the following year, was present; but did not step forth in defence of that species of writing. He probably did not like to trust himself with JOHNSON!</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson observed, that the force of our early habits was so great, that though reason approved, nay, though our senses relished a different course, almost every man returned to them. I do not believe there is any observation upon human nature better founded than this; and, in many cases, it is a very painful truth; for where early habits have been mean and wretched, the joy and elevation resulting from better modes of life must be damped by the gloomy consciousness of being under an almost inevitable doom to sink back into a situation which we recollect with disgust. It surely may be prevented, by constant attention and unremitting exertion to establish contrary habits of superiour efficacy.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">The Beggar&rsquo;s Opera</span>, and the common question, whether it was pernicious in its effects, having been introduced; &mdash; JOHNSON. &lsquo;As to this matter, which has been very much contested, I myself am of opinion, that more influence has been ascribed to <span class="t8">The Beggar&rsquo;s Opera</span>, than it in reality ever had; for I do not believe that any man was ever made a rogue by being present at its representation. At the same time I do not deny that it may have some influence, by making the character of a rogue familiar, and in some degree pleasing.&rsquo; Then collecting himself as it were, to give a heavy stroke: &lsquo;There is in it such a <span class="t8">labefactation</span> of all principles, as may be injurious to morality.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">While he pronounced this response, we sat in a comical sort of restraint, smothering a laugh, which we were afraid might burst out. In his <span class="t8">Life of Gay</span>, he has been still more decisive as to the inefficiency of <span class="t8">The Beggar&rsquo;s Opera</span> in corrupting society. But I have ever thought somewhat differently; for, indeed, not only are the gaiety and heroism of a highwayman very captivating to a youthful imagination, but the arguments for adventurous depredation are so plausible, the allusions so lively, and the contrasts with the ordinary and more painful modes of acquiring property are so artfully displayed, that it requires a cool and strong judgement to resist so imposing an aggregate: yet, I own, I should be very sorry to have <span class="t8">The Beggar&rsquo;s Opera</span> suppressed; for there is in it so much of real London life, so much brilliant wit, and such a variety of airs, which, from early association of ideas, engage, soothe, and enliven the mind, that no performance which the theatre exhibits, delights me more.</p>
<p class="p24">The late &lsquo;<span class="t8">worthy</span>&rsquo; Duke of Queensberry, as Thomson, in his <span class="t8">Seasons</span>, justly characterises him, told me, that when Gay first shewed him <span class="t8">The Beggar&rsquo;s Opera</span>, his Grace&rsquo;s observation was, &lsquo;This is a very odd thing, Gay; I am satisfied that it is either a very good thing, or a very bad thing.&rsquo; It proved the former, beyond the warmest expectations of the authour or his friends, Mr. Cambridge, however, shewed us to-day, that there was good reason enough to doubt concerning its success. He was told by Quin, that during the first night of its appearance it was long in a very dubious state; that there was a disposition to damn it, and that it was saved by the song,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Oh ponder well! be not severe!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">the audience being much affected by the innocent looks of Polly, when she came to those two lines, which exhibit at once a painful and ridiculous image,</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;For on the rope that hangs my Dear,<br/>Depends poor Polly&rsquo;s life.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Quin himself had so bad an opinion of it, that he refused the part of Captain Macheath, and gave it to Walker, who acquired great celebrity by his grave yet animated performance of it.</p>
<p class="p24">We talked of a young gentleman&rsquo;s marriage with an eminent singer, and his determination that she should no longer sing in publick, though his father was very earnest she should, because her talents would be liberally rewarded, so as to make her a good fortune. It was questioned whether the young gentleman, who had not a shilling in the world, but was blest with very uncommon talents, was not foolishly delicate, or foolishly proud, and his father truely rational without being mean. Johnson, with all the high spirit of a Roman senator, exclaimed, &lsquo;He resolved wisely and nobly to be sure. He is a brave man. Would not a gentleman be disgraced by having his wife singing publickly for hire? No, Sir, there can be no doubt here. I know not if I should not <span class="t8">prepare</span> myself for a publick singer, as readily as let my wife be one.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson arraigned the modern politicks of this country, as entirely devoid of all principle of whatever kind. &lsquo;Politicks (said he) are now nothing more than means of rising in the world. With this sole view do men engage in politicks, and their whole conduct proceeds upon it. How different in that respect is the state of the nation now from what it was in the time of Charles the First, during the Usurpation, and after the Restoration, in the time of Charles the Second. <span class="t8">Hudibras</span> affords a strong proof how much hold political principles had then upon the minds of men. There is in <span class="t8">Hudibras</span> a great deal of bullion which will always last. But to be sure the brightest strokes of his wit owed their force to the impression of the characters, which was upon men&rsquo;s minds at the time; to their knowing them, at table and in the street; in short, being familiar with them; and above all, to his satire being directed against those whom a little while before they had hated and feared. The nation in general has ever been loyal, has been at all times attached to the monarch, though a few daring rebels have been wonderfully powerful for a time. The murder of Charles the First was undoubtedly not committed with the approbation or consent of the people. Had that been the case, Parliament would not have ventured to consign the regicides to their deserved punishment. And we know what exuberance of joy there was when Charles the Second was restored. If Charles the Second had bent all his mind to it, had made it his sole object, he might have been as absolute as Louis the Fourteenth.&rsquo; A gentleman observed he would have done no harm if he had. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, absolute princes seldom do any harm. But they who are governed by them are governed by chance. There is no security for good government.&rsquo; CAMBRIDGE. &lsquo;There have been many sad victims to absolute government.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;So, Sir, have there been to popular factions.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;The question is, which is worst, one wild beast or many?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson praised <span class="t8">The Spectator</span>, particularly the character of Sir Roger de Coverley. He said, &lsquo;Sir Roger did not die a violent death, as has been generally fancied. He was not killed; he died only because others were to die, and because his death afforded an opportunity to Addison for some very fine writing. We have the example of Cervantes making Don Quixote die. &mdash; I never could see why Sir Roger is represented as a little cracked. It appears to me that the story of the widow was intended to have something superinduced upon it: but the superstructure did not come.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Somebody found fault with writing verses in a dead language, maintaining that they were merely arrangements of so many words, and laughed at the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge, for sending forth collections of them not only in Greek and Latin, but even in Syriac, Arabick, and other more unknown tongues. JOHNSON. &lsquo;I would have as many of these as possible; I would have verses in every language that there are the means of acquiring. Nobody imagines that an University is to have at once two hundred poets; but it should be able to show two hundred scholars. Pieresc&rsquo;s death was lamented, I think, in forty languages. And I would have had at every coronation, and every death of a King, every <span class="t8">Gaudium</span>, and every <span class="t8">Luctus</span>, University-verses, in as many languages as can be acquired. I would have the world to be thus told, &ldquo;Here is a school where every thing may be learnt.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Having set out next day on a visit to the Earl of Pembroke, at Wilton, and to my friend, Mr. Temple, at Mamhead, in Devonshire, and not having returned to town till the second of May, I did not see Dr. Johnson for a considerable time, and during the remaining part of my stay in London, kept very imperfect notes of his conversation, which had I according to my usual custom written out at large soon after the time, much might have been preserved, which is now irretrievably lost. I can now only record some particular scenes, and a few fragments of his <span class="t8">memorabilia</span>. But to make some amends for my relaxation of diligence in one respect, I have to present my readers with arguments upon two law cases, with which he favoured me.</p>
<p class="p24">On Saturday, the sixth of May, we dined by ourselves at the Mitre, and he dictated to me what follows, to obviate the complaint already mentioned, which had been made in the form of an action in the Court of Session, by Dr. Memis, of Aberdeen, that in the same translation of a charter in which <span class="t8">physicians</span> were mentioned, he was called <span class="t8">Doctor of Medicine</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;There are but two reasons for which a physician can decline the title of <span class="t8">Doctor of Medicine</span>, because he supposes himself disgraced by the doctorship, or supposes the doctorship disgraced by himself. To be disgraced by a title which he shares in common with every illustrious name of his profession, with Boerhaave, with Arbuthnot, and with Cullen, can surely diminish no man&rsquo;s reputation. It is, I suppose, to the doctorate, from which he shrinks, that he owes his right of practising physick. A doctor of Medicine is a physician under the protection of the laws, and by the stamp of authority. The physician, who is not a Doctor, usurps a profession, and is authorised only by himself to decide upon health and sickness, and life and death. That this gentleman is a Doctor, his diploma makes evident; a diploma not obtruded upon him, but obtained by solicitation, and for which fees were paid. With what countenance any man can refuse the title which he has either begged or bought, is not easily discovered.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;All verbal injury must comprise in it either some false position, or some unnecessary declaration of defamatory truth. That in calling him Doctor, a false appellation was given him, he himself will not pretend, who at the same time that he complains of the title, would be offended if we supposed him to be not a Doctor. If the title of Doctor be a defamatory truth, it is time to dissolve our colleges; for why should the publick give salaries to men whose approbation is reproach? It may likewise deserve the notice of the publick to consider what help can be given to the professors of physick, who all share with this unhappy gentleman the ignominious appellation, and of whom the very boys in the street are not afraid to say, <span class="t8">There goes the Doctor</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;What is implied by the term Doctor is well known. It distinguishes him to whom it is granted, as a man who has attained such knowledge of his profession as qualifies him to instruct others. A Doctor of Laws is a man who can form lawyers by his precepts. A Doctor of Medicine is a man who can teach the art of curing diseases. There is an old axiom which no man has yet thought fit to deny, <span class="t8">Nil dat quod non habet</span>. Upon this principle to be Doctor implies skill, for <span class="t8">nemo docet quod non didicit</span>. In England, whoever practises physick, not being a Doctor, must practise by a licence: but the doctorate conveys a licence in itself.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;By what accident it happened that he and the other physicians were mentioned in different terms, where the terms themselves were equivalent, or where in effect that which was applied to him was the most honourable, perhaps they who wrote the paper cannot now remember. Had they expected a lawsuit to have been the consequence of such petty variation, I hope they would have avoided it. But, probably, as they meant no ill, they suspected no danger, and, therefore, consulted only what appeared to them propriety or convenience.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">A few days afterwards I consulted him upon a cause, <span class="t8">Paterson and others</span> against <span class="t8">Alexander and others</span>, which had been decided by a casting vote in the Court of Session, determining that the Corporation of Stirling was corrupt, and setting aside the election of some of their officers, because it was proved that three of the leading men who influenced the majority had entered into an unjustifiable compact, of which, however, the majority were ignorant. He dictated to me, after a little consideration, the following sentences upon the subject: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;There is a difference between majority and superiority; majority is applied to number, and superiority to power; and power, like many other things, is to be estimated <span class="t8">non numero sed pondere</span>. Now though the greater <span class="t8">number</span> is not corrupt, the greater <span class="t8">weight</span> is corrupt, so that corruption predominates in the borough, taken <span class="t8">collectively</span>, though, perhaps, taken <span class="t8">numerically</span>, the greater part may be uncorrupt. That borough, which is so constituted as to act corruptly, is in the eye of reason corrupt, whether it be by the uncontrolable power of a few, or by an accidental pravity of the multitude. The objection, in which is urged the injustice of making the innocent suffer with the guilty, is an objection not only against society, but against the possibility of society. All societies, great and small, subsist upon this condition; that as the individuals derive advantages from union, they may likewise suffer inconveniences; that as those who do nothing, and sometimes those who do ill, will have the honours and emoluments of general virtue and general prosperity, so those likewise who do nothing, or perhaps do well, must be involved in the consequences of predominant corruption.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">This in my opinion was a very nice case; but the decision was affirmed in the House of Lords.</p>
<p class="p24">On Monday, May 8, we went together and visited the mansions of Bedlam. I had been informed that he had once been there before with Mr. Wedderburne, (now Lord Loughborough,) Mr. Murphy, and Mr. Foote; and I had heard Foote give a very entertaining account of Johnson&rsquo;s happening to have his attention arrested by a man who was very furious, and who, while beating his straw, supposed it was William Duke of Cumberland, whom he was punishing for his cruelties in Scotland, in 1746. There was nothing peculiarly remarkable this day; but the general contemplation of insanity was very affecting. I accompanied him home, and dined and drank tea with him.</p>
<p class="p24">Talking of an acquaintance of ours, distinguished for knowing an uncommon variety of miscellaneous articles both in antiquities and polite literature, he observed, &lsquo;You know, Sir, he runs about with little weight upon his mind.&rsquo; And talking of another very ingenious gentleman, who from the warmth of his temper was at variance with many of his acquaintance, and wished to avoid them, he said, &lsquo;Sir, he leads the life of an outlaw.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Friday, May 12, as he had been so good as to assign me a room in his house, where I might sleep occasionally, when I happened to sit with him to a late hour, I took possession of it this night, found every thing in excellent order, and was attended by honest Francis with a most civil assiduity. I asked Johnson whether I might go to a consultation with another lawyer upon Sunday, as that appeared to me to be doing work as much in my way, as if an artisan should work on the day appropriated for religious rest. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, when you are of consequence enough to oppose the practice of consulting upon Sunday, you should do it: but you may go now. It is not criminal, though it is not what one should do, who is anxious for the preservation and increase of piety, to which a peculiar observance of Sunday is a great help. The distinction is clear between what is of moral and what is of ritual obligation.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Saturday, May 13, I breakfasted with him by invitation, accompanied by Mr. Andrew Crosbie, a Scotch Advocate, whom he had seen at Edinburgh, and the Hon. Colonel (now General) Edward Stopford, brother to Lord Courtown, who was desirous of being introduced to him. His tea and rolls and butter, and whole breakfast apparatus were all in such decorum, and his behaviour was so courteous, that Colonel Stopford was quite surprised, and wondered at his having heard so much said of Johnson&rsquo;s slovenliness and roughness. I have preserved nothing of what passed, except that Crosbie pleased him much by talking learnedly of alchymy, as to which Johnson was not a positive unbeliever, but rather delighted in considering what progress had actually been made in the transmutation of metals, what near approaches there had been to the making of gold; and told us that it was affirmed, that a person in the Russian dominions had discovered the secret, but died without revealing it, as imagining it would be prejudicial to society. He added, that it was not impossible but it might in time be generally known.</p>
<p class="p24">It being asked whether it was reasonable for a man to be angry at another whom a woman had preferred to him; &mdash; JOHNSON. &lsquo;I do not see, Sir, that it is reasonable for a man to be angry at another, whom a woman has preferred to him: but angry he is, no doubt; and he is loath to be angry at himself.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Before setting out for Scotland on the 23rd, I was frequently in his company at different places, but during this period have recorded only two remarks: one concerning Garrick: &lsquo;He has not Latin enough. He finds out the Latin by the meaning rather than the meaning by the Latin.&rsquo; And another concerning writers of travels, who, he observed, &lsquo;were more defective than any other writers.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I passed many hours with him on the 17th, of which I find all my memorial is, &lsquo;much laughing.&rsquo; It should seem he had that day been in a humour for jocularity and merriment, and upon such occasions I never knew a man laugh more heartily. We may suppose, that the high relish of a state so different from his habitual gloom, produced more than ordinary exertions of that distinguishing faculty of man, which has puzzled philosophers so much to explain. Johnson&rsquo;s laugh was as remarkable as any circumstance in his manner. It was a kind of good humoured growl. Tom Davies described it drolly enough: &lsquo;He laughs like a rhinoceros.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To BENNET LANGTON, ESQ.</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I have an old amanuensis in great distress. I have given what I think I can give, and begged till I cannot tell where to beg again. I put into his hands this morning four guineas. If you could collect three guineas more, it would clear him from his present difficulty.</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;I am, Sir,<br/>&lsquo;Your most humble servant,<br/>&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;May 21, 1775.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To JAMES BOSWELL, ESQ.</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I make no doubt but you are now safely lodged in your own habitation, and have told all your adventures to Mrs. Boswell and Miss Veronica. Pray teach Veronica to love me. Bid her not mind mamma.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Mrs. Thrale has taken cold, and been very much disordered, but I hope is grown well. Mr. Langton went yesterday to Lincolnshire, and has invited Nicolaida to follow him. Beauclerk talks of going to Bath. I am to set out on Monday; so there is nothing but dispersion.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I have returned Lord Hailes&rsquo;s entertaining sheets, but must stay till I come back for more, because it will be inconvenient to send them after me in my vagrant state.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I promised Mrs. Macaulay that I would try to serve her son at Oxford. I have not forgotten it, nor am unwilling to perform it. If they desire to give him an English education, it should be considered whether they cannot send him for a year or two to an English school. If he comes immediately from Scotland, he can make no figure in our Universities. The schools in the north, I believe, are cheap; and, when I was a young man, were eminently good.</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;There are two little books published by the Foulis, Telemachus and<br/>Collins&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Poems</span>, each a shilling: I would be glad to have them.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Make my compliments to Mrs. Boswell, though she does not love me. You see what perverse things ladies are, and how little fit to be trusted with feudal estates. When she mends and loves me, there may be more hope of her daughters.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I will not send compliments to my friends by name, because I would be loath to leave any out in the enumeration. Tell them, as you see them, how well I speak of Scotch politeness, and Scotch hospitality, and Scotch beauty, and of every thing Scotch, but Scotch oat-cakes, and Scotch prejudices.</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;Let me know the answer of Rasay, and the decision relating to Sir<br/>Allan.</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;I am, my dearest Sir, with great affection,<br/>&lsquo;Your most obliged, and<br/>&lsquo;Most humble servant,<br/>&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;May 27, 1775.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">After my return to Scotland, I wrote three letters to him, from which I extract the following passages: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I have seen Lord Hailes since I came down. He thinks it wonderful that you are pleased to take so much pains in revising his <span class="t8">Annals</span>. I told him that you said you were well rewarded by the entertainment which you had in reading them.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;There has been a numerous flight of Hebrideans in Edinburgh this summer, whom I have been happy to entertain at my house. Mr. Donald Macqueen and Lord Monboddo supped with me one evening. They joined in controverting your proposition, that the Gaelick of the Highlands and Isles of Scotland was not written till of late.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;My mind has been somewhat dark this summer. I have need of your warming and vivifying rays; and I hope I shall have them frequently. I am going to pass some time with my father at Auchinleck.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To JAMES BOSWELL, ESQ.</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am returned from the annual ramble into the middle counties. Having seen nothing I had not seen before, I have nothing to relate. Time has left that part of the island few antiquities; and commerce has left the people no singularities. I was glad to go abroad, and, perhaps, glad to come home; which is, in other words, I was, I am afraid, weary of being at home, and weary of being abroad. Is not this the state of life? But, if we confess this weariness, let us not lament it, for all the wise and all the good say, that we may cure it.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;For the black fumes which rise in your mind, I can prescribe nothing but that you disperse them by honest business or innocent pleasure, and by reading, sometimes easy and sometimes serious. Change of place is useful; and I hope that your residence at Auchinleck will have many good effects.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;That I should have given pain to Rasay, I am sincerely sorry; and am therefore very much pleased that he is no longer uneasy. He still thinks that I have represented him as personally giving up the Chieftainship. I meant only that it was no longer contested between the two houses, and supposed it settled, perhaps, by the cession of some remote generation, in the house of Dunvegan. I am sorry the advertisement was not continued for three or four times in the paper.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;That Lord Monboddo and Mr. Macqueen should controvert a position contrary to the imaginary interest of literary or national prejudice, might be easily imagined; but of a standing fact there ought to be no controversy: If there are men with tails, catch an <span class="t8">homo caudatus</span>; if there was writing of old in the Highlands or Hebrides, in the Erse language, produce the manuscripts. Where men write, they will write to one another, and some of their letters, in families studious of their ancestry, will be kept. In Wales there are many manuscripts.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I have now three parcels of Lord Hailes&rsquo;s history, which I purpose to return all the next week: that his respect for my little observations should keep his work in suspense, makes one of the evils of my journey. It is in our language, I think, a new mode of history, which tells all that is wanted, and, I suppose, all that is known, without laboured splendour of language, or affected subtilty of conjecture. The exactness of his dates raises my wonder. He seems to have the closeness of Henault without his constraint.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Mrs. Thrale was so entertained with your <span class="t8">Journal</span>, that she almost read herself blind. She has a great regard for you.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Of Mrs. Boswell, though she knows in her heart that she does not love me, I am always glad to hear any good, and hope that she and the little dear ladies will have neither sickness nor any other affliction. But she knows that she does not care what becomes of me, and for that she may be sure that I think her very much to blame.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Never, my dear Sir, do you take it into your head to think that I do not love you; you may settle yourself in full confidence both of my love and my esteem; I love you as a kind man, I value you as a worthy man, and hope in time to reverence you as a man of exemplary piety. I hold you, as Hamlet has it, &lsquo;in my heart of hearts,&rsquo; and therefore, it is little to say, that I am, Sir,</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;Your affectionate humble servant,<br/>&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;London, Aug. 27, 1775.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">TO THE SAME.</span></p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;If in these papers there is little alteration attempted, do not suppose me negligent. I have read them perhaps more closely than the rest; but I find nothing worthy of an objection.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Write to me soon, and write often, and tell me all your honest heart.</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;I am Sir,<br/>&lsquo;Yours affectionately,<br/>&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Aug. 30, 1775.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">TO THE SAME.</span></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">&lsquo;MY DEAR SIR,</span></p>
<p class="p21">&lsquo;I now write to you, lest in some of your freaks and humours you should fancy yourself neglected. Such fancies I must entreat you never to admit, at least never to indulge: for my regard for you is so radicated and fixed, that it is become part of my mind, and cannot be effaced but by some cause uncommonly violent; therefore, whether I write or not, set your thoughts at rest. I now write to tell you that I shall not very soon write again, for I am to set out to-morrow on another journey.</p>
<p class="p10">* * * * *</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;Your friends are all well at Streatham, and in Leicester-fields.<br/>Make my compliments to Mrs. Boswell, if she is in good humour with me.</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;I am, Sir, &amp;c.<br/>&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;September 14, 1775.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">What he mentions in such light terms as, &lsquo;I am to set out to-morrow on another journey,&rsquo; I soon afterwards discovered was no less than a tour to France with Mr. and Mrs. Thrale. This was the only time in his life that he went upon the Continent.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To MR. ROBERT LEVET.</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;Sept. 18, 1775.<br/>Calais.</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;We are here in France, after a very pleasing passage of no more than six hours. I know not when I shall write again, and therefore I write now, though you cannot suppose that I have much to say. You have seen France yourself. From this place we are going to Rouen, and from Rouen to Paris, where Mr. Thrale designs to stay about five or six weeks. We have a regular recommendation to the English resident, so we shall not be taken for vagabonds. We think to go one way and return another, and for [?see] as much as we can. I will try to speak a little French; I tried hitherto but little, but I spoke sometimes. If I heard better, I suppose I should learn faster. I am, Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your humble servant,</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">To THE SAME.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Paris, Oct. 22, 1775.</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;We are still here, commonly very busy in looking about us. We have been to-day at Versailles. You have seen it, and I shall not describe it. We came yesterday from Fontainbleau, where the Court is now. We went to see the King and Queen at dinner, and the Queen was so impressed by Miss, that she sent one of the Gentlemen to enquire who she was. I find all true that you have ever told me of Paris. Mr. Thrale is very liberal, and keeps us two coaches, and a very fine table; but I think our cookery very bad. Mrs. Thrale got into a convent of English nuns, and I talked with her through the grate, and I am very kindly used by the English Benedictine friars. But upon the whole I cannot make much acquaintance here; and though the churches, palaces, and some private houses are very magnificent, there is no very great pleasure after having seen many, in seeing more; at least the pleasure, whatever it be, must some time have an end, and we are beginning to think when we shall come home. Mr. Thrale calculates that, as we left Streatham on the fifteenth of September, we shall see it again about the fifteenth of November.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I think I had not been on this side of the sea five days before I found a sensible improvement in my health. I ran a race in the rain this day, and beat Baretti. Baretti is a fine fellow, and speaks French, I think, quite as well as English.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Make my compliments to Mrs. Williams; and give my love to Francis; and tell my friends that I am not lost.</p>
<p class="p24">I am, dear Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your affectionate humble, &amp;c.</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To DR. SAMUEL JOHNSON.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Edinburgh, Oct. 24, 1775.</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">&lsquo;MY DEAR SIR,</span></p>
<p class="p21">&lsquo;If I had not been informed that you were at Paris, you should have had a letter from me by the earliest opportunity, announcing the birth of my son, on the 9th instant; I have named him Alexander, after my father. I now write, as I suppose your fellow traveller, Mr. Thrale, will return to London this week, to attend his duty in Parliament, and that you will not stay behind him.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I send another parcel of Lord Hailes&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Annals</span>, I have undertaken to solicit you for a favour to him, which he thus requests in a letter to me: &ldquo;I intend soon to give you <span class="t8">The Life of Robert Bruce</span>, which you will be pleased to transmit to Dr. Johnson. I wish that you could assist me in a fancy which I have taken, of getting Dr. Johnson to draw a character of Robert Bruce, from the account that I give of that prince. If he finds materials for it in my work, it will be a proof that I have been fortunate in selecting the most striking incidents.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I suppose by <span class="t8">The Life of Robert Bruce</span>, his Lordship means that part of his <span class="t8">Annals</span> which relates the history of that prince, and not a separate work.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Shall we have <span class="t8">A Journey to Paris</span> from you in the winter? You will, I hope, at any rate be kind enough to give me some account of your French travels very soon, for I am very impatient. What a different scene have you viewed this autumn, from that which you viewed in autumn 1773! I ever am, my dear Sir,</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;Your much obliged and<br/>&lsquo;Affectionate humble servant,<br/>&lsquo;JAMES BOSWELL.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">&lsquo;TO JAMES BOSWELL, ESQ.</span></p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am glad that the young Laird is born, and an end, as I hope, put to the only difference that you can ever have with Mrs. Boswell. I know that she does not love me; but I intend to persist in wishing her well till I get the better of her.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Paris is, indeed, a place very different from the Hebrides, but it is to a hasty traveller not so fertile of novelty, nor affords so many opportunities of remark. I cannot pretend to tell the publick any thing of a place better known to many of my readers than to myself. We can talk of it when we meet.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I shall go next week to Streatham, from whence I purpose to send a parcel of the <span class="t8">History</span> every post. Concerning the character of Bruce, I can only say, that I do not see any great reason for writing it; but I shall not easily deny what Lord Hailes and you concur in desiring.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I have been remarkably healthy all the journey, and hope you and your family have known only that trouble and danger which has so happily terminated. Among all the congratulations that you may receive, I hope you believe none more warm or sincere, than those of, dear Sir,</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;Your most affectionate,<br/>&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;November 16, 1775.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">&lsquo;TO MRS. LUCY PORTER, IN LICHFIELD.</span></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">&lsquo;DEAR MADAM,</span></p>
<p class="p21">&lsquo;This week I came home from Paris. I have brought you a little box, which I thought pretty; but I know not whether it is properly a snuff-box, or a box for some other use. I will send it, when I can find an opportunity. I have been through the whole journey remarkably well. My fellow-travellers were the same whom you saw at Lichfield, only we took Baretti with us. Paris is not so fine a place as you would expect. The palaces and churches, however, are very splendid and magnificent; and what would please you, there are many very fine pictures; but I do not think their way of life commodious or pleasant.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Let me know how your health has been all this while. I hope the fine summer has given you strength sufficient to encounter the winter.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Make my compliments to all my friends; and, if your fingers will let you, write to me, or let your maid write, if it be troublesome to you. I am, dear Madam,</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;Your most affectionate humble servant,<br/>&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;November 16, 1775.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">TO THE SAME.</span></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">&lsquo;DEAR MADAM,</span></p>
<p class="p21">&lsquo;Some weeks ago I wrote to you, to tell you that I was just come home from a ramble, and hoped that I should have heard from you. I am afraid winter has laid hold on your fingers, and hinders you from writing. However, let somebody write, if you cannot, and tell me how you do, and a little of what has happened at Lichfield among our friends. I hope you are all well.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;When I was in France, I thought myself growing young, but am afraid that cold weather will take part of my new vigour from me. Let us, however, take care of ourselves, and lose no part of our health by negligence.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I never knew whether you received the <span class="t8">Commentary on the New Testament</span> and the <span class="t8">Travels</span>, and the glasses.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Do, my dear love, write to me; and do not let us forget each other. This is the season of good wishes, and I wish you all good. I have not lately seen Mr. Porter, nor heard of him. Is he with you?</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Be pleased to make my compliments to Mrs. Adey, and Mrs. Cobb, and all my friends; and when I can do any good, let me know.</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;I am, dear Madam,<br/>&lsquo;Yours most affectionately,<br/>&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;December, 1775.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">It is to be regretted that he did not write an account of his travels in France; for as he is reported to have once said, that &lsquo;he could write the Life of a Broomstick,&rsquo; so, notwithstanding so many former travellers have exhausted almost every subject for remark in that great kingdom, his very accurate observation, and peculiar vigour of thought and illustration, would have produced a valuable work. During his visit to it, which lasted but about two months, he wrote notes or minutes of what he saw. He promised to show me them, but I neglected to put him in mind of it; and the greatest part of them has been lost, or perhaps, destroyed in a precipitate burning of his papers a few days before his death, which must ever be lamented. One small paper-book, however, entitled &lsquo;FRANCE II,&rsquo; has been preserved, and is in my possession. It is a diurnal register of his life and observations, from the 10th of October to the 4th of November, inclusive, being twenty-six days, and shows an extraordinary attention to various minute particulars. Being the only memorial of this tour that remains, my readers, I am confident, will peruse it with pleasure, though his notes are very short, and evidently written only to assist his own recollection.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Oct. 10. Tuesday. We saw the <span class="t8">Ecole Militaire</span>, in which one hundred and fifty young boys are educated for the army. They have arms of different sizes, according to the age; &mdash; flints of wood. The building is very large, but nothing fine, except the council-room. The French have large squares in the windows; &mdash; they make good iron palisades. Their meals are gross.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;We visited the Observatory, a large building of a great height. The upper stones of the parapet very large, but not cramped with iron. The flat on the top is very extensive; but on the insulated part there is no parapet. Though it was broad enough, I did not care to go upon it. Maps were printing in one of the rooms.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;We walked to a small convent of the Fathers of the Oratory. In the reading-desk of the refectory lay the lives of the Saints.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Oct. 11. Wednesday. We went to see <span class="t8">Hotel de Chatlois</span>, a house not very large, but very elegant. One of the rooms was gilt to a degree that I never saw before. The upper part for servants and their masters was pretty.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Thence we went to Mr. Monville&rsquo;s, a house divided into small apartments, furnished with effeminate and minute elegance. &mdash; Porphyry.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Thence we went to St. Roque&rsquo;s church, which is very large; &mdash; the lower part of the pillars incrusted with marble. &mdash; Three chapels behind the high altar; &mdash; the last a mass of low arches. &mdash; Altars, I believe, all round.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;We passed through <span class="t8">Place de Vend√¥me</span>, a fine square, about as big as Hanover-square. &mdash; Inhabited by the high families. &mdash; Lewis XIV. on horse-back in the middle.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Monville is the son of a farmer-general. In the house of Chatlois is a room furnished with japan, fitted up in Europe.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;We dined with Boccage, the Marquis Blanchetti, and his lady. &mdash; The sweetmeats taken by the Marchioness Blanchetti, after observing that they were dear. &mdash; Mr. Le Roy, Count Manucci, the Abb√©, the Prior, and Father Wilson, who staid with me, till I took him home in the coach.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Bathiani is gone.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The French have no laws for the maintenance of their poor. &mdash; Monk not necessarily a priest. &mdash; Benedictines rise at four; are at church an hour and half; at church again half an hour before, half an hour after, dinner; and again from half an hour after seven to eight. They may sleep eight hours. &mdash; Bodily labour wanted in monasteries.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The poor taken to hospitals, and miserably kept. &mdash; Monks in the convent fifteen: &mdash; accounted poor.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Oct. 12. Thursday. We went to the Gobelins. &mdash; Tapestry makes a good picture; &mdash; imitates flesh exactly. &mdash; One piece with a gold ground; &mdash; the birds not exactly coloured. &mdash; Thence we went to the King&rsquo;s cabinet; &mdash; very neat, not, perhaps, perfect. &mdash; Gold ore. &mdash; Candles of the candle-tree. &mdash; Seeds. &mdash; Woods. Thence to Gagnier&rsquo;s house, where I saw rooms nine, furnished with a profusion of wealth and elegance which I never had seen before. &mdash; Vases. &mdash; Pictures. &mdash; The Dragon china. &mdash; The lustre said to be of crystal, and to have cost 3,500¬£. &mdash; The whole furniture said to have cost 125,000¬£. &mdash; Damask hangings covered with pictures. &mdash; Porphyry. &mdash; This house struck me. &mdash; Then we waited on the ladies to Monville&rsquo;s. &mdash; Captain Irwin with us. &mdash; Spain. County towns all beggars. &mdash; At Dijon he could not find the way to Orleans. &mdash; Cross roads of France very bad. &mdash; Five soldiers. &mdash; Woman. &mdash; Soldiers escaped. &mdash; The Colonel would not lose five men for the death of one woman. &mdash; The magistrate cannot seize a soldier but by the Colonel&rsquo;s permission. &mdash; Good inn at Nismes. &mdash; Moors of Barbary fond of Englishmen. &mdash; Gibraltar eminently healthy; &mdash; It has beef from Barbary; &mdash; There is a large garden. &mdash; Soldiers sometimes fall from the rock.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Oct. 13. Friday. I staid at home all day, only went to find the Prior, who was not at home. &mdash; I read something in Canus. &mdash; <span class="t8">Nec admiror, nec multum laudo</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">Oct. 14. Saturday. We went to the house of Mr. Argenson, which was almost wainscotted with looking-glasses, and covered with gold. &mdash; The ladies&rsquo; closet wainscotted with large squares of glass over painted paper. They always place mirrours to reflect their rooms.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Then we went to Julien&rsquo;s, the Treasurer of the Clergy: &mdash; 30,000¬£ a year. &mdash; The house has no very large room, but is set with mirrours, and covered with gold. &mdash; Books of wood here, and in another library.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;At D &mdash; &mdash; &lsquo;s I looked into the books in the lady&rsquo;s closet, and, in contempt, shewed them to Mr. T. &mdash; <span class="t8">Prince Titi</span>; <span class="t8">Bibl. des F√©es</span>, and other books. &mdash; She was offended, and shut up, as we heard afterwards, her apartment.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Then we went to Julien Le Roy, the King&rsquo;s watch-maker, a man of character in his business, who shewed a small clock made to find the longitude. &mdash; A decent man.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Afterwards we saw the <span class="t8">Palais Marchand</span>, and the Courts of Justice, civil and criminal. &mdash; Queries on the <span class="t8">Sellette</span>. &mdash; This building has the old Gothick passages, and a great appearance of antiquity. &mdash; Three hundred prisoners sometimes in the gaol.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Much disturbed; hope no ill will be.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;In the afternoon I visited Mr. Freron the journalist. He spoke Latin very scantily, but seemed to understand me. &mdash; His house not splendid, but of commodious size. &mdash; His family, wife, son, and daughter, not elevated but decent. &mdash; I was pleased with my reception. &mdash; He is to translate my books, which I am to send him with notes.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Oct. 15. Sunday. At Choisi, a royal palace on the banks of the Seine, about 7m. from Paris. &mdash; The terrace noble along the river. &mdash; The rooms numerous and grand, but not discriminated from other palaces. &mdash; The chapel beautiful, but small. &mdash; China globes. &mdash; Inlaid tables. &mdash; Labyrinth. &mdash; Sinking table. &mdash; Toilet tables.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Oct. 16. Monday. The Palais Royal very grand, large, and lofty. &mdash; A very great collection of pictures. &mdash; Three of Raphael. &mdash; Two Holy Family. &mdash; One small piece of M. Angelo. &mdash; One room of Rubens &mdash; I thought the pictures of Raphael fine.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The Thuilleries. &mdash; Statues. &mdash; Venus. &mdash; Aen. and Anchises in his arms. &mdash; Nilus. &mdash; Many more. The walks not open to mean persons. &mdash; Chairs at night hired for two sous apiece. &mdash; Pont tournant.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Austin Nuns. &mdash; Grate. &mdash; Mrs. Fermor, Abbess. &mdash; She knew Pope, and thought him disagreeable. &mdash; Mrs. &mdash;&mdash;&nbsp; &mdash; has many books; &mdash; has seen life. &mdash; Their frontlet disagreeable. &mdash; Their hood. &mdash; Their life easy. &mdash; Rise about five; hour and half in chapel. &mdash; Dine at ten. &mdash; Another hour and half at chapel; half an hour about three, and half an hour more at seven: &mdash; four hours in chapel. &mdash; A large garden. &mdash; Thirteen pensioners. &mdash; Teacher complained.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;At the Boulevards saw nothing, yet was glad to be there. &mdash; Rope-dancing and farce. &mdash; Egg dance.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;N. [Note.] Near Paris, whether on week-days or Sundays, the roads empty.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Oct. 17, Tuesday. At the Palais Marchand I bought</p>
<p class="p26">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A snuff-box, 24 L.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &mdash;&mdash;&nbsp; &mdash;&mdash;&nbsp; &mdash;&mdash; 6<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Table book 15<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scissars 3 p [pair] 18<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &mdash;&mdash; <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;63 &mdash; 2 12 6</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;We heard the lawyers plead. &mdash; N. As many killed at Paris as there are days in the year. <span class="t8">Chambre de question</span>. &mdash; Tournelle at the Palais Marchand. &mdash; An old venerable building.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The Palais Bourbon, belonging to the Prince of Cond√©. Only one small wing shown; &mdash; lofty; &mdash; splendid; &mdash; gold and glass. &mdash; The battles of the great Cond√© are painted in one of the rooms. The present Prince a grandsire at thirty-nine.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The sight of palaces, and other great buildings, leaves no very distinct images, unless to those who talk of them. As I entered, my wife was in my mind: she would have been pleased. Having now nobody to please, I am little pleased.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;N. In France there is no middle rank.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;So many shops open, that Sunday is little distinguished at Paris. &mdash; The palaces of Louvre and Thuilleries granted out in lodgings.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;In the <span class="t8">Palais de Bourbon</span>, gilt globes of metal at the fire-place.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The French beds commended. &mdash; Much of the marble, only paste.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The Colosseum a mere wooden building, at least much of it.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Oct. 18. Wednesday. We went to Fontainebleau, which we found a large mean town, crowded with people. &mdash; The forest thick with woods, very extensive. &mdash; Manucci secured us lodgings. &mdash; The appearance of the country pleasant. No hills, few streams, only one hedge. &mdash; I remember no chapels nor crosses on the road. &mdash; Pavement still, and rows of trees.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;N. Nobody but mean people walk in Paris.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Oct. 19. Thursday. At Court, we saw the apartments; &mdash; the King&rsquo;s bed-chamber and council-chamber extremely splendid &mdash; Persons of all ranks in the external rooms through which the family passes: &mdash; servants and masters. &mdash; Brunet with us the second time.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The introductor came to us; &mdash; civil to me. &mdash; Presenting. &mdash; I had scruples. &mdash; Not necessary. &mdash; We went and saw the King and Queen at dinner. &mdash; We saw the other ladies at dinner &mdash; Madame Elizabeth, with the Princess of Guimen√©. &mdash; At night we went to a comedy. I neither saw nor heard. &mdash; Drunken women. &mdash; Mrs. Th. preferred one to the other.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Oct. 20. Friday. We saw the Queen mount in the forest &mdash; Brown habit; rode aside: one lady rode aside. &mdash; The Queen&rsquo;s horse light grey; martingale. &mdash; She galloped. &mdash; We then went to the apartments, and admired them. &mdash; Then wandered through the palace. &mdash; In the passages, stalls and shops. &mdash; Painting in Fresco by a great master, worn out. &mdash; We saw the King&rsquo;s horses and dogs. &mdash; The dogs almost all English. &mdash; Degenerate.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The horses not much commended. &mdash; The stables cool; the kennel filthy.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;At night the ladies went to the opera. I refused, but should have been welcome.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The King fed himself with his left hand as we.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Saturday, 21. In the night I got ground. &mdash; We came home to Paris. &mdash; I think we did not see the chapel. &mdash; Tree broken by the wind. &mdash; The French chairs made all of boards painted.</p>
<p class="p24">N. Soldiers at the court of justice. &mdash; Soldiers not amenable to the magistrates. &mdash; Dijon woman.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Faggots in the palace. &mdash; Every thing slovenly, except in the chief rooms. &mdash; Trees in the roads, some tall, none old, many very young and small.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Women&rsquo;s saddles seem ill made. &mdash; Queen&rsquo;s bridle woven with silver. &mdash; Tags to strike the horse.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Sunday, Oct. 22. To Versailles, a mean town. Carriages of business passing. &mdash; Mean shops against the wall. &mdash; Our way lay through S√™ve, where the China manufacture. &mdash; Wooden bridge at S√™ve, in the way to Versailles. &mdash; The palace of great extent. &mdash; The front long; I saw it not perfectly. &mdash; The Menagerie. Cygnets dark; their black feet; on the ground; tame. &mdash; Halcyons, or gulls. &mdash; Stag and hind, young. &mdash; Aviary, very large; the net, wire. &mdash; Black stag of China, small. &mdash; Rhinoceros, the horn broken and pared away, which, I suppose, will grow; the basis, I think, four inches &lsquo;cross; the skin folds like loose cloth doubled over his body, and cross his hips; a vast animal, though young; as big, perhaps, as four oxen. &mdash; The young elephant, with his tusks just appearing. &mdash; The brown bear put out his paws; &mdash; all very tame. &mdash; The lion. &mdash; The tigers I did not well view. &mdash; The camel, or dromedary with two bunches called the Huguin, taller than any horse. &mdash; Two camels with one bunch. &mdash; Among the birds was a pelican, who being let out, went to a fountain, and swam about to catch fish. His feet well webbed: he dipped his head, and turned his long bill sidewise. He caught two or three fish, but did not eat them.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Trianon is a kind of retreat appendant to Versailles. It has an open portico; the pavement, and, I think, the pillars, of marble. &mdash; There are many rooms, which I do not distinctly remember &mdash; A table of porphyry, about five feet long, and between two and three broad, given to Louis XIV. by the Venetian State. &mdash; In the council-room almost all that was not door or window, was, I think, looking-glass. &mdash; Little Trianon is a small palace like a gentleman&rsquo;s house. &mdash; The upper floor paved with brick. &mdash; Little Vienne. &mdash; The court is ill paved. &mdash; The rooms at the top are small, fit to sooth the imagination with privacy. In the front of Versailles are small basons of water on the terrace, and other basons, I think, below them. There are little courts. &mdash; The great gallery is wainscotted with mirrors, not very large, but joined by frames. I suppose the large plates were not yet made. &mdash; The play-house was very large. &mdash; The chapel I do not remember if we saw &mdash; We saw one chapel, but I am not certain whether there or at Trianon. &mdash; The foreign office paved with bricks. &mdash; The dinner half a Louis each, and, I think, a Louis over. &mdash; Money given at Menagerie, three livres; at palace, six livres.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Oct. 23. Monday. Last night I wrote to Levet. &mdash; We went to see the looking-glasses wrought. They come from Normandy in cast plates, perhaps the third of an inch thick. At Paris they are ground upon a marble table, by rubbing one plate upon another with grit between them. The various sands, of which there are said to be five, I could not learn. The handle, by which the upper glass is moved, has the form of a wheel, which may be moved in all directions. The plates are sent up with their surfaces ground, but not polished, and so continue till they are bespoken, lest time should spoil the surface, as we were told. Those that are to be polished, are laid on a table, covered with several thick cloths, hard strained, that the resistance may be equal; they are then rubbed with a hand rubber, held down hard by a contrivance which I did not well understand. The powder which is used last seemed to me to be iron dissolved in aqua fortis: they called it, as Baretti said, <span class="t8">marc de beau forte</span>, which he thought was dregs. They mentioned vitriol and salt-petre. The cannon ball swam in the quicksilver. To silver them, a leaf of beaten tin is laid, and rubbed with quicksilver, to which it unites. Then more quicksilver is poured upon it, which, by its mutual [attraction] rises very high. Then a paper is laid at the nearest end of the plate, over which the glass is slided till it lies upon the plate, having driven much of the quicksilver before it. It is then, I think, pressed upon cloths, and then set sloping to drop the superfluous mercury; the slope is daily heightened towards a perpendicular.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;In the way I saw the Greve, the Mayor&rsquo;s house, and the Bastile.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;We then went to Sans-terre, a brewer. He brews with about as much malt as Mr. Thrale, and sells his beer at the same price, though he pays no duty for malt, and little more than half as much for beer. Beer is sold retail at 6d. a bottle. He brews 4,000 barrels a year. There are seventeen brewers in Paris, of whom none is supposed to brew more than he: &mdash; reckoning them at 3,000 each, they make 51,000 a year. &mdash; They make their malt, for malting is here no trade. The moat of the Bastile is dry.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Oct. 24, Tuesday. We visited the King&rsquo;s library &mdash; I saw the <span class="t8">Speculum humanae Salvationis</span>, rudely printed, with ink, sometimes pale, sometimes black; part supposed to be with wooden types, and part with pages cut on boards. &mdash; The Bible, supposed to be older than that of Mentz, in 62: it has no date; it is supposed to have been printed with wooden types. &mdash; I am in doubt; the print is large and fair, in two folios. &mdash; Another book was shown me, supposed to have been printed with wooden types; &mdash; I think, <span class="t8">Durandi Sanctuarium</span> in 58. This is inferred from the difference of form sometimes seen in the same letter, which might be struck with different puncheons. &mdash; The regular similitude of most letters proves better that they are metal. &mdash; I saw nothing but the <span class="t8">Speculum</span> which I had not seen, I think, before.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Thence to the Sorbonne. &mdash; The library very large, not in lattices like the King&rsquo;s. <span class="t8">Marbone</span> and <span class="t8">Durandi</span>, q. collection 14 vol. <span class="t8">Scriptores de rebus Gallicis</span>, many folios. &mdash; <span class="t8">Histoire G√©n√©alogique of France</span>, 9 vol. &mdash; <span class="t8">Gallia Christiana</span>, the first edition, 4to. the last, f. 12 vol. &mdash; The Prior and Librarian dined [with us]: &mdash; I waited on them home. &mdash; Their garden pretty, with covered walks, but small; yet may hold many students. &mdash; The Doctors of the Sorbonne are all equal: &mdash; choose those who succeed to vacancies. &mdash; Profit little.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Oct. 25. Wednesday. I went with the Prior to St. Cloud, to see Dr. Hooke. &mdash; We walked round the palace, and had some talk. &mdash; I dined with our whole company at the Monastery. &mdash; In the library,<span class="t8">Beroald</span>, &mdash; <span class="t8">Cymon</span>, &mdash; <span class="t8">Titus</span>, from Boccace. &mdash; <span class="t8">Oratio Proverbialis</span> to the Virgin, from Petrarch; Falkland to Sandys; Dryden&rsquo;s Preface to the third vol. of Miscellanies.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Oct. 26. Thursday. We saw the china at S√™ve, cut, glazed, painted. Bellevue, a pleasing house, not great: fine prospect. &mdash; Meudon, an old palace. &mdash; Alexander, in Porphyry: hollow between eyes and nose, thin cheeks. &mdash; Plato and Aristotle &mdash; Noble terrace overlooks the town. &mdash; St. Cloud. &mdash; Gallery not very high, nor grand, but pleasing. &mdash; In the rooms, Michael Angelo, drawn by himself, Sir Thomas More, Des Cartes, Bochart, Naudacus, Mazarine. &mdash; Gilded wainscot, so common that it is not minded. &mdash; Gough and Keene. &mdash; Hooke came to us at the inn. &mdash; A message from Drumgold.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Oct. 27. Friday. I staid at home. &mdash; Gough and Keene, and Mrs. S &mdash; &mdash; &lsquo;s friend dined with us. &mdash; This day we began to have a fire. &mdash; The weather is grown very cold, and I fear, has a bad effect upon my breath, which has grown much more free and easy in this country.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Sat. Oct. 28. I visited the Grand Chartreux built by St. Louis. &mdash; It is built for forty, but contains only twenty-four, and will not maintain more. The friar that spoke to us had a pretty apartment. &mdash; Mr. Baretti says four rooms; I remember but three. &mdash; His books seemed to be French. &mdash; His garden was neat; he gave me grapes. &mdash; We saw the Place de Victoire, with the statues of the King, and the captive nations.</p>
<p class="p24">We saw the palace and gardens of Luxembourg, but the gallery was shut. &mdash; We climbed to the top stairs. &mdash; I dined with Colbrooke, who had much company: &mdash; Foote, Sir George Rodney, Motteux, Udson, Taaf. &mdash; Called on the Prior, and found him in bed.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Hotel &mdash; a guinea a day. &mdash; Coach, three guineas a week. &mdash; Valet de place, three l. a day. &mdash; <span class="t8">Avantcoureur</span>, a guinea a week. &mdash; Ordinary dinner, six l. a head. &mdash; Our ordinary seems to be about five guineas a day. &mdash; Our extraordinary expences, as diversions, gratuities, clothes, I cannot reckon. &mdash; Our travelling is ten guineas a day.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;White stockings, 18l. &mdash; Wig. &mdash; Hat.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Sunday, Oct. 29. We saw the boarding-school. &mdash; The <span class="t8">Enfans trouv√©s</span> . &mdash; A room with about eighty-six children in cradles, as sweet as a parlour. &mdash; They lose a third; take in to perhaps more than seven [years old]; put them to trades; pin to them the papers sent with them. &mdash; Want nurses. &mdash; Saw their chapel.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Went to St. Eustatia; saw an innumerable company of girls catechised, in many bodies, perhaps 100 to a catechist. &mdash; Boys taught at one time, girls at another. &mdash; The sermon; the preacher wears a cap, which he takes off at the name: &mdash; his action uniform, not very violent.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Oct. 30. Monday. We saw the library of St. Germain. &mdash; A very noble collection. &mdash; <span class="t8">Codex Divinorum Officiorum</span>, 1459: &mdash; a letter, square like that of the <span class="t8">Offices</span>, perhaps the same. &mdash; The <span class="t8">Codex</span>, by Fust and Gernsheym. &mdash; <span class="t8">Meursius</span>, 12 v. fol. &mdash; <span class="t8">Amadis</span>, in French, 3 v. fol. &mdash; CATHOLICON <span class="t8">sine colophone</span>, but of 1460. &mdash; Two other editions, one by ‚Ä¶ <span class="t8">Augustin. de Civitate Dei</span>, without name, date, or place, but of Fust&rsquo;s square letter as it seems.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I dined with Col. Drumgold; &mdash; had a pleasing afternoon.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Some of the books of St. Germain&rsquo;s stand in presses from the wall, like those at Oxford.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Oct. 31. Tuesday. I lived at the Benedictines; meagre day; soup meagre, herrings, eels, both with sauce; fryed fish; lentils, tasteless in themselves. In the library; where I found <span class="t8">Maffeus&rsquo;s de Histori√¢ Indic√¢: Promontorium flectere, to double the Cape</span>. I parted very tenderly from the Prior and Friar Wilkes.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Maitre des Arts</span>, 2 y. &mdash; <span class="t8">Bacc. Theol</span>. 3 y. &mdash; <span class="t8">Licentiate</span>, 2 y. &mdash; <span class="t8">Doctor Th</span>. 2 y. in all 9 years. &mdash; For the Doctorate three disputations, <span class="t8">Major, Minor, Sorbonica</span>. &mdash; Several colleges suppressed, and transferred to that which was the Jesuits&rsquo; College.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Nov. 1. Wednesday. We left Paris. &mdash; St. Denis, a large town; the church not very large, but the middle isle is very lofty and aweful. &mdash; On the left are chapels built beyond the line of the wall, which destroy the symmetry of the sides. The organ is higher above the pavement than any I have ever seen. &mdash; The gates are of brass. &mdash; On the middle gate is the history of our Lord. &mdash; The painted windows are historical, and said to be eminently beautiful. &mdash; We were at another church belonging to a convent, of which the portal is a dome; we could not enter further, and it was almost dark.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Nov. 2. Thursday. We came this day to Chantilly, a seat belonging to the Prince of Cond√©. &mdash; This place is eminently beautified by all varieties of waters starting up in fountains, falling in cascades, running in streams, and spread in lakes. &mdash; The water seems to be too near the house. &mdash; All this water is brought from a source or river three leagues off, by an artificial canal, which for one league is carried under ground. &mdash; The house is magnificent. &mdash; The cabinet seems well stocked: what I remember was, the jaws of a hippopotamus, and a young hippopotamus preserved, which, however, is so small, that I doubt its reality. &mdash; It seems too hairy for an abortion, and too small for a mature birth. &mdash; Nothing was in spirits; all was dry. &mdash; The dog, the deer; the ant-bear with long snout. &mdash; The toucan, long broad beak. &mdash; The stables were of very great length. &mdash; The kennel had no scents. &mdash; There was a mockery of a village. &mdash; The Menagerie had few animals. For Dr. Blagden see <span class="t8">post</span>, 1780 in Mr. Langton&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Collection</span>. &mdash; Two faussans, or Brasilian weasels, spotted, very wild. &mdash; There is a forest, and, I think, a park. &mdash; I walked till I was very weary, and next morning felt my feet battered, and with pains in the toes.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Nov. 3. Friday. We came to Compiegne, a very large town, with a royal palace built round a pentagonal court. &mdash; The court is raised upon vaults, and has, I suppose, an entry on one side by a gentle rise. &mdash; Talk of painting, &mdash; The church is not very large, but very elegant and splendid. &mdash; I had at first great difficulty to walk, but motion grew continually easier. &mdash; At night we came to Noyon, an episcopal city. &mdash; The cathedral is very beautiful, the pillars alternately gothick and Corinthian. &mdash; We entered a very noble parochial church. &mdash; Noyon is walled, and is said to be three miles round.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Nov. 4. Saturday. We rose very early, and came through St. Quintin to Cambray, not long after three. &mdash; We went to an English nunnery, to give a letter to Father Welch, the confessor, who came to visit us in the evening.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Nov. 5. Sunday. We saw the cathedral. &mdash; It is very beautiful, with chapels on each side. The choir splendid. The balustrade in one part brass. &mdash; The Neff very high and grand. &mdash; The altar silver as far as it is seen. &mdash; The vestments very splendid. &mdash; At the Benedictines church &mdash; &mdash; &lsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Here his Journal ends abruptly. Whether he wrote any more after this time, I know not; but probably not much, as he arrived in England about the 12th of November. These short notes of his tour, though they may seem minute taken singly, make together a considerable mass of information, and exhibit such an ardour of enquiry and acuteness of examination, as, I believe, are found in but few travellers, especially at an advanced age. They completely refute the idle notion which has been propagated, <span class="t8">that he could not see</span>; and, if he had taken the trouble to revise and digest them, he undoubtedly could have expanded them into a very entertaining narrative.</p>
<p class="p24">When I met him in London the following year, the account which he gave me of his French tour, was, &lsquo;Sir, I have seen all the visibilities of Paris, and around it; but to have formed an acquaintance with the people there, would have required more time than I could stay. I was just beginning to creep into acquaintance by means of Colonel Drumgold, a very high man, Sir, head of <span class="t8">L&rsquo;Ecole Militaire</span>, a most complete character, for he had first been a professor of rhetorick, and then became a soldier. And, Sir, I was very kindly treated by the English Benedictines, and have a cell appropriated to me in their convent.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He observed, &lsquo;The great in France live very magnificently, but the rest very miserably. There is no happy middle state as in England. The shops of Paris are mean; the meat in the markets is such as would be sent to a gaol in England: and Mr. Thrale justly observed, that the cookery of the French was forced upon them by necessity; for they could not eat their meat, unless they added some taste to it. The French are an indelicate people; they will spit upon any place. At Madame &mdash; &mdash; &lsquo;s, a literary lady of rank, the footman took the sugar in his fingers, and threw it into my coffee. I was going to put it aside; but hearing it was made on purpose for me, I e&rsquo;en tasted Tom&rsquo;s fingers. The same lady would needs make tea <span class="t8">√† l&rsquo;Angloise</span>. The spout of the tea-pot did not pour freely; she bad the footman blow into it. France is worse than Scotland in every thing but climate. Nature has done more for the French; but they have done less for themselves than the Scotch have done.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">It happened that Foote was at Paris at the same time with Dr. Johnson, and his description of my friend while there, was abundantly ludicrous. He told me, that the French were quite astonished at his figure and manner, and at his dress, which he obstinately continued exactly as in London; &mdash; his brown clothes, black stockings, and plain shirt. He mentioned, that an Irish gentleman said to Johnson, &lsquo;Sir, you have not seen the best French players.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Players, Sir! I look on them as no better than creatures set upon tables and joint-stools to make faces and produce laughter, like dancing dogs.&rsquo;&mdash; &lsquo;But, Sir, you will allow that some players are better than others?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Yes, Sir, as some dogs dance better than others.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">While Johnson was in France, he was generally very resolute in speaking Latin. It was a maxim with him that a man should not let himself down, by speaking a language which he speaks imperfectly. Indeed, we must have often observed how inferiour, how much like a child a man appears, who speaks a broken tongue. When Sir Joshua Reynolds, at one of the dinners of the Royal Academy, presented him to a Frenchman of great distinction, he would not deign to speak French, but talked Latin, though his Excellency did not understand it, owing, perhaps, to Johnson&rsquo;s English pronunciation: yet upon another occasion he was observed to speak French to a Frenchman of high rank, who spoke English; and being asked the reason, with some expression of surprise, &mdash; he answered, &lsquo;because I think my French is as good as his English.&rsquo; Though Johnson understood French perfectly, he could not speak it readily, as I have observed at his first interview with General Paoli, in 1769; yet he wrote it, I imagine, pretty well, as appears from some of his letters in Mrs. Piozzi&rsquo;s collection, of which I shall transcribe one: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">A Madame La Comtesse de &mdash;&mdash; </span>. &lsquo;July 16, 1775.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Oui, <span class="t8">Madame, le moment est arriv√©, et il faut que je parte. Mais pourquoi faut il partir? Est ce que je m&rsquo;ennuye? Je m&rsquo;ennuyerai ailleurs. Est ce que je cherche ou quelque plaisir, ou quelque soulagement? Je ne cherche rien, je n&rsquo;espere rien. Aller voir ce que jai v√ª, etre un peu rejou√©, un peu degout√©, me resouvenir que la vie se passe en vain, me plaindre de moi, m&rsquo;endurcir aux dehors; void le tout de ce qu&rsquo;on compte pour les delices de l&rsquo;anne√©. Que Dieu vous donne, Madame, tous les agr√©mens de la vie, avec un esprit qui peut en jouir sans s&rsquo;y livrer trop</span>.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Here let me not forget a curious anecdote, as related to me by Mr. Beauclerk, which I shall endeavour to exhibit as well as I can in that gentleman&rsquo;s lively manner; and in justice to him it is proper to add, that Dr. Johnson told me I might rely both on the correctness of his memory, and the fidelity of his narrative. &lsquo;When Madame de Boufflers was first in England, (said Beauclerk,) she was desirous to see Johnson. I accordingly went with her to his chambers in the Temple, where she was entertained with his conversation for some time. When our visit was over, she and I left him, and were got into Inner Temple-lane, when all at once I heard a noise like thunder. This was occasioned by Johnson, who it seems, upon a little recollection, had taken it into his head that he ought to have done the honours of his literary residence to a foreign lady of quality, and eager to shew himself a man of gallantry, was hurrying down the stair-case in violent agitation. He overtook us before we reached the Temple-gate, and brushing in between me and Madame de Boufflers, seized her hand, and conducted her to her coach. His dress was a rusty brown morning suit, a pair of old shoes by way of slippers, a little shrivelled wig sticking on the top of his head, and the sleeves of his shirt and the knees of his breeches hanging loose. A considerable crowd of people gathered round, and were not a little struck by this singular appearance.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He spoke Latin with wonderful fluency and elegance. When Pere Boscovich was in England, Johnson dined in company with him at Sir Joshua Reynolds&rsquo;s, and at Dr. Douglas&rsquo;s, now Bishop of Salisbury. Upon both occasions that celebrated foreigner expressed his astonishment at Johnson&rsquo;s Latin conversation. When at Paris, Johnson thus characterised Voltaire to Freron the Journalist: &lsquo;<span class="t8">Vir est acerrimi ingenii et paucarum literarum!</span>&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">&lsquo;TO DR. SAMUEL JOHNSON.</span></p>
<p class="p21">&lsquo;Edinburgh, Dec. 5, 1775.</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">&lsquo;MY DEAR SIR,</span></p>
<p class="p21">&lsquo;Mr. Alexander Maclean, the young Laird of Col, being to set out to-morrow for London, I give him this letter to introduce him to your acquaintance. The kindness which you and I experienced from his brother, whose unfortunate death we sincerely lament, will make us always desirous to shew attention to any branch of the family. Indeed, you have so much of the true Highland cordiality, that I am sure you would have thought me to blame if I had neglected to recommend to you this Hebridean prince, in whose island we were hospitably entertained.</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;I ever am with respectful attachment, my dear Sir,<br/>&lsquo;Your most obliged<br/>&lsquo;And most humble servant,<br/>&lsquo;JAMES BOSWELL.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Mr. Maclean returned with the most agreeable accounts of the polite attention with which he was received by Dr. Johnson.</p>
<p class="p24">In the course of this year Dr. Burney informs me that &lsquo;he very frequently met Dr. Johnson at Mr. Thrale&rsquo;s, at Streatham, where they had many long conversations, often sitting up as long as the fire and candles lasted, and much longer than the patience of the servants subsisted.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">A few of Johnson&rsquo;s sayings, which that gentleman recollects, shall here be inserted.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I never take a nap after dinner but when I have had a bad night, and then the nap takes me.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The writer of an epitaph should not be considered as saying nothing but what is strictly true. Allowance must be made for some degree of exaggerated praise. In lapidary inscriptions a man is not upon oath.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;There is now less flogging in our great schools than formerly, but then less is learned there; so that what the boys get at one end they lose at the other.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;More is learned in publick than in private schools, from emulation; there is the collision of mind with mind, or the radiation of many minds pointing to one centre. Though few boys make their own exercises, yet if a good exercise is given up, out of a great number of boys, it is made by somebody.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I hate by-roads in education. Education is as well known, and has long been as well known, as ever it can be. Endeavouring to make children prematurely wise is useless labour. Suppose they have more knowledge at five or six years old than other children, what use can be made of it? It will be lost before it is wanted, and the waste of so much time and labour of the teacher can never be repaid. Too much is expected from precocity, and too little performed. Miss &mdash;&mdash; was an instance of early cultivation, but in what did it terminate? In marrying a little Presbyterian parson, who keeps an infant boarding-school, so that all her employment now is,</p>
<p class="p24">&ldquo;To suckle fools, and chronicle small-beer.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;She tells the children, &ldquo;This is a cat, and that is a dog, with four legs and a tail; see there! you are much better than a cat or a dog, for you can speak.&rdquo; If I had bestowed such an education on a daughter, and had discovered that she thought of marrying such a fellow, I would have sent her to the <span class="t8">Congress</span>.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;After having talked slightingly of musick, he was observed to listen very attentively while Miss Thrale played on the harpsichord, and with eagerness he called to her, &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you dash away like Burney?&rdquo; Dr. Burney upon this said to him, &ldquo;I believe, Sir, we shall make a musician of you at last.&rdquo; Johnson with candid complacency replied, &ldquo;Sir, I shall be glad to have a new sense given to me.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;He had come down one morning to the breakfast-room, and been a considerable time by himself before any body appeared. When, on a subsequent day, he was twitted by Mrs. Thrale for being very late, which he generally was, he defended himself by alluding to the extraordinary morning, when he had been too early. &ldquo;Madam, I do not like to come down to <span class="t8">vacuity</span>.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Dr. Burney having remarked that Mr. Garrick was beginning to look old, he said, &ldquo;Why, Sir, you are not to wonder at that; no man&rsquo;s face has had more wear and tear.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Not having heard from him for a longer time than I supposed he would be silent, I wrote to him December 18, not in good spirits: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Sometimes I have been afraid that the cold which has gone over Europe this year like a sort of pestilence has seized you severely: sometimes my imagination, which is upon occasions prolifick of evil, hath figured that you may have somehow taken offence at some part of my conduct.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To JAMES BOSWELL, ESQ.</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Never dream of any offence. How should you offend me? I consider your friendship as a possession, which I intend to hold till you take it from me, and to lament if ever by my fault I should lose it. However, when such suspicions find their way into your mind, always give them vent; I shall make haste to disperse them; but hinder their first ingress if you can. Consider such thoughts as morbid.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Such illness as may excuse my omission to Lord Hailes, I cannot honestly plead. I have been hindered, I know not how, by a succession of petty obstructions. I hope to mend immediately, and to send next post to his Lordship. Mr. Thrale would have written to you if I had omitted; he sends his compliments and wishes to see you.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;You and your lady will now have no more wrangling about feudal inheritance. How does the young Laird of Auchinleck? I suppose Miss Veronica is grown a reader and discourser.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I have just now got a cough, but it has never yet hindered me from sleeping: I have had quieter nights than are common with me.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I cannot but rejoice that Joseph has had the wit to find the way back. He is a fine fellow, and one of the best travellers in the world.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Young Col brought me your letter. He is a very pleasing youth. I took him two days ago to the Mitre, and we dined together. I was as civil as I had the means of being.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I have had a letter from Rasay, acknowledging, with great appearance of satisfaction, the insertion in the Edinburgh paper. I am very glad that it was done.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;My compliments to Mrs. Boswell, who does not love me; and of all the rest, I need only send them to those that do: and I am afraid it will give you very little trouble to distribute them.</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;I am, my dear, dear Sir,<br/>&lsquo;Your affectionate humble servant,<br/>&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;December, 23, 1775.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">1776: √ÜTAT. 67 &mdash; In 1776, Johnson wrote, so far as I can discover, nothing for the publick: but that his mind was still ardent, and fraught with generous wishes to attain to still higher degrees of literary excellence, is proved by his private notes of this year, which I shall insert in their proper place.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To JAMES BOSWELL, ESQ.</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I have at last sent you all Lord Hailes&rsquo;s papers. While I was in France, I looked very often into Henault; but Lord Hailes, in my opinion, leaves him far and far behind. Why I did not dispatch so short a perusal sooner, when I look back, I am utterly unable to discover: but human moments are stolen away by a thousand petty impediments which leave no trace behind them. I have been afflicted, through the whole Christmas, with the general disorder, of which the worst effect was a cough, which is now much mitigated, though the country, on which I look from a window at Streatham, is now covered with a deep snow. Mrs. Williams is very ill: every body else is as usual.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Among the papers, I found a letter to you, which I think you had not opened; and a paper for <span class="t8">The Chronicle</span>, which I suppose it not necessary now to insert. I return them both.</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;I have, within these few days, had the honour of receiving Lord<br/>Hailes&rsquo;s first volume, for which I return my most respectful thanks.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I wish you, my dearest friend, and your haughty lady, (for I know she does not love me,) and the young ladies, and the young Laird, all happiness. Teach the young gentleman, in spite of his mamma, to think and speak well of,</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;Sir,<br/>&lsquo;Your affectionate humble servant,<br/>&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Jan. 10, 1776.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">At this time was in agitation a matter of great consequence to me and my family, which I should not obtrude upon the world, were it not that the part which Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s friendship for me made him take in it, was the occasion of an exertion of his abilities, which it would be injustice to conceal. That what he wrote upon the subject may be understood, it is necessary to give a state of the question, which I shall do as briefly as I can.</p>
<p class="p24">In the year 1504, the barony or manour of Auchinleck, (pronounced <span class="t8">Affleck</span>,) in Ayrshire, which belonged to a family of the same name with the lands, having fallen to the Crown by forfeiture, James the Fourth, King of Scotland, granted it to Thomas Boswell, a branch of an ancient family in the county of Fife, stiling him in the charter, <span class="t8">dilecto familiari nostro</span>; and assigning, as the cause of the grant, <span class="t8">pro bono et fideli servitio nobis praestito</span>. Thomas Boswell was slain in battle, fighting along with his Sovereign, at the fatal field of Flodden, in 1513.</p>
<p class="p24">From this very honourable founder of our family, the estate was transmitted, in a direct series of heirs male, to David Boswell, my father&rsquo;s great grand uncle, who had no sons, but four daughters, who were all respectably married, the eldest to Lord Cathcart.</p>
<p class="p24">David Boswell, being resolute in the military feudal principle of continuing the male succession, passed by his daughters, and settled the estate on his nephew by his next brother, who approved of the deed, and renounced any pretensions which he might possibly have, in preference to his son. But the estate having been burthened with large portions to the daughters, and other debts, it was necessary for the nephew to sell a considerable part of it, and what remained was still much encumbered.</p>
<p class="p24">The frugality of the nephew preserved, and, in some degree, relieved the estate. His son, my grandfather, an eminent lawyer, not only re-purchased a great part of what had been sold, but acquired other lands; and my father, who was one of the Judges of Scotland, and had added considerably to the estate, now signified his inclination to take the privilege allowed by our law, to secure it to his family in perpetuity by an entail, which, on account of his marriage articles, could not be done without my consent.</p>
<p class="p24">In the plan of entailing the estate, I heartily concurred with him, though I was the first to be restrained by it; but we unhappily differed as to the series of heirs which should be established, or in the language of our law, called to the succession. My father had declared a predilection for heirs general, that is, males and females indiscriminately. He was willing, however, that all males descending from his grandfather should be preferred to females; but would not extend that privilege to males deriving their descent from a higher source. I, on the other hand, had a zealous partiality for heirs male, however remote, which I maintained by arguments which appeared to me to have considerable weight. And in the particular case of our family, I apprehended that we were under an implied obligation, in honour and good faith, to transmit the estate by the same tenure which we held it, which was as heirs male, excluding nearer females. I therefore, as I thought conscientiously, objected to my father&rsquo;s scheme.</p>
<p class="p24">My opposition was very displeasing to my father, who was entitled to great respect and deference; and I had reason to apprehend disagreeable consequences from my non-compliance with his wishes. After much perplexity and uneasiness, I wrote to Dr. Johnson, stating the case, with all its difficulties, at full length, and earnestly requesting that he would consider it at leisure, and favour me with his friendly opinion and advice.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To James Boswell, Esq.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Dear Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I was much impressed by your letter, and if I can form upon your case any resolution satisfactory to myself, will very gladly impart it: but whether I am quite equal to it, I do not know. It is a case compounded of law and justice, and requires a mind versed in juridical disquisitions. Could not you tell your whole mind to Lord Hailes? He is, you know, both a Christian and a Lawyer. I suppose he is above partiality, and above loquacity: and, I believe, he will not think the time lost in which he may quiet a disturbed, or settle a wavering mind. Write to me, as any thing occurs to you; and if I find myself stopped by want of facts necessary to be known, I will make inquiries of you as my doubts arise.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;If your former resolutions should be found only fanciful, you decide rightly in judging that your father&rsquo;s fancies may claim the preference; but whether they are fanciful or rational, is the question. I really think Lord Hailes could help us.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Make my compliments to dear Mrs. Boswell; and tell her, that I hope to be wanting in nothing that I can contribute to bring you all out of your troubles.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am, dear Sir, most affectionately,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your humble servant,</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;London, Jan. 15, 1776.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">TO THE SAME.</span></p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am going to write upon a question which requires more knowledge of local law, and more acquaintance with the general rules of inheritance, than I can claim; but I write, because you request it.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Land is, like any other possession, by natural right wholly in the power of its present owner; and may be sold, given, or bequeathed, absolutely or conditionally, as judgment shall direct, or passion incite.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;But natural right would avail little without the protection of law; and the primary notion of law is restraint in the exercise of natural right. A man is therefore, in society, not fully master of what he calls his own, but he still retains all the power which law does not take from him.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;In the exercise of the right which law either leaves or gives, regard is to be paid to moral obligations.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Of the estate which we are now considering, your father still retains such possession, with such power over it, that he can sell it, and do with the money what he will, without any legal impediment. But when he extends his power beyond his own life, by settling the order of succession, the law makes your consent necessary.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Let us suppose that he sells the land to risk the money in some specious adventure, and in that adventure loses the whole; his posterity would be disappointed; but they could not think themselves injured or robbed. If he spent it upon vice or pleasure, his successors could only call him vicious and voluptuous; they could not say that he was injurious or unjust.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;He that may do more may do less. He that, by selling, or squandering, may disinherit a whole family, may certainly disinherit part, by a partial settlement.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Laws are formed by the manners and exigencies of particular times, and it is but accidental that they last longer than their causes: the limitation of feudal succession to the male arose from the obligation of the tenant to attend his chief in war.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;As times and opinions are always changing, I know not whether it be not usurpation to prescribe rules to posterity, by presuming to judge of what we cannot know: and I know not whether I fully approve either your design or your father&rsquo;s, to limit that succession which descended to you unlimited. If we are to leave <span class="t8">sartum tectum</span> to posterity, what we have without any merit of our own received from our ancestors, should not choice and free-will be kept unviolated? Is land to be treated with more reverence than liberty? &mdash; If this consideration should restrain your father from disinheriting some of the males, does it leave you the power of disinheriting all the females?</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Can the possessor of a feudal estate make any will? Can he appoint, out of the inheritance, any portions to his daughters? There seems to be a very shadowy difference between the power of leaving land, and of leaving money to be raised from land; between leaving an estate to females, and leaving the male heir, in effect, only their steward.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Suppose at one time a law that allowed only males to inherit, and during the continuance of this law many estates to have descended, passing by the females, to remoter heirs. Suppose afterwards the law repealed in correspondence with a change of manners, and women made capable of inheritance; would not then the tenure of estates be changed? Could the women have no benefit from a law made in their favour? Must they be passed by upon moral principles for ever, because they were once excluded by a legal prohibition? Or may that which passed only to males by one law, pass likewise to females by another?</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;You mention your resolution to maintain the right of your brothers:<br/>I do not see how any of their rights are invaded.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;As your whole difficulty arises from the act of your ancestor, who diverted the succession from the females, you enquire, very properly, what were his motives, and what was his intention; for you certainly are not bound by his act more than he intended to bind you, nor hold your land on harder or stricter terms than those on which it was granted.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Intentions must be gathered from acts. When he left the estate to his nephew, by excluding his daughters, was it, or was it not, in his power to have perpetuated the succession to the males? If he could have done it, he seems to have shown, by omitting it, that he did not desire it to be done; and, upon your own principles, you will not easily prove your right to destroy that capacity of succession which your ancestors have left.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;If your ancestor had not the power of making a perpetual settlement; and if, therefore, we cannot judge distinctly of his intentions, yet his act can only be considered as an example; it makes not an obligation. And, as you observe, he set no example of rigorous adherence to the line of succession. He that overlooked a brother, would not wonder that little regard is shown to remote relations.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;As the rules of succession are, in a great part, purely legal, no man can be supposed to bequeath any thing, but upon legal terms; he can grant no power which the law denies; and if he makes no special and definite limitation, he confers all the power which the law allows.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your ancestor, for some reason, disinherited his daughters; but it no more follows that he intended this act as a rule for posterity, than the disinheriting of his brother.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;If, therefore, you ask by what right your father admits daughters to inheritance, ask yourself, first, by what right you require them to be excluded?</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;It appears, upon reflection, that your father excludes nobody; he only admits nearer females to inherit before males more remote; and the exclusion is purely consequential.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;These, dear Sir, are my thoughts, immethodical and deliberative; but, perhaps, you may find in them some glimmering of evidence.</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;I cannot, however, but again recommend to you a conference with Lord<br/>Hailes, whom you know to be both a Lawyer and a Christian.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Make my compliments to Mrs. Boswell, though she does not love me.</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;I am, Sir,<br/>&lsquo;Your affectionate servant,<br/>&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Feb. 3, 1773&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I had followed his recommendation and consulted Lord Hailes, who upon this subject had a firm opinion contrary to mine. His Lordship obligingly took the trouble to write me a letter, in which he discussed with legal and historical learning, the points in which I saw much difficulty, maintaining that &lsquo;the succession of heirs general was the succession, by the law of Scotland, from the throne to the cottage, as far as we can learn it by record;&rsquo; observing that the estate of our family had not been limited to heirs male; and that though an heir male had in one instance been chosen in preference to nearer females, that had been an arbitrary act, which had seemed to be best in the embarrassed state of affairs at that time; and the fact was, that upon a fair computation of the value of land and money at the time, applied to the estate and the burthens upon it, there was nothing given to the heir male but the skeleton of an estate. &lsquo;The plea of conscience (said his Lordship,) which you put, is a most respectable one, especially when <span class="t8">conscience</span> and <span class="t8">self</span> are on different sides. But I think that conscience is not well informed, and that self and she ought on this occasion to be of a side.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">This letter, which had considerable influence upon my mind, I sent to Dr. Johnson, begging to hear from him again, upon this interesting question.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To JAMES BOSWELL, ESQ.</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Having not any acquaintance with the laws or customs of Scotland, I endeavoured to consider your question upon general principles, and found nothing of much validity that I could oppose to this position: &ldquo;He who inherits a fief unlimited by his ancestors, inherits the power of limiting it according to his own judgement or opinion.&rdquo; If this be true, you may join with your father.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Further consideration produces another conclusion: &ldquo;He who receives a fief unlimited by his ancestors, gives his heirs some reason to complain, if he does not transmit it unlimited to posterity. For why should he make the state of others worse than his own, without a reason?&rdquo; If this be true, though neither you nor your father are about to do what is quite right, but as your father violates (I think) the legal succession least, he seems to be nearer the right than yourself.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;It cannot but occur that &ldquo;Women have natural and equitable claims as well as men, and these claims are not to be capriciously or lightly superseded or infringed.&rdquo; When fiefs implied military service, it is easily discerned why females could not inherit them; but that reason is now at an end. As manners make laws, manners likewise repeal them.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;These are the general conclusions which I have attained. None of them are very favourable to your scheme of entail, nor perhaps to any scheme. My observation, that only he who acquires an estate may bequeath it capriciously, if it contains any conviction, includes this position likewise, that only he who acquires an estate may entail it capriciously. But I think it may be safely presumed, that &ldquo;he who inherits an estate, inherits all the power legally concomitant;&rdquo; and that &ldquo;He who gives or leaves unlimited an estate legally limitable, must be presumed to give that power of limitation which he omitted to take away, and to commit future contingencies to future prudence.&rdquo; In these two positions I believe Lord Hailes will advise you to rest; every other notion of possession seems to me full of difficulties and embarrassed with scruples.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;If these axioms be allowed, you have arrived now at full liberty without the help of particular circumstances, which, however, have in your case great weight. You very rightly observe, that he who passing by his brother gave the inheritance to his nephew, could limit no more than he gave; and by Lord Hailes&rsquo;s estimate of fourteen years&rsquo; purchase, what he gave was no more than you may easily entail according to your own opinion, if that opinion should finally prevail.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Lord Hailes&rsquo;s suspicion that entails are encroachments on the dominion of Providence, may be extended to all hereditary privileges and all permanent institutions; I do not see why it may not be extended to any provision for the present hour, since all care about futurity proceeds upon a supposition, that we know at least in some degree what will be future. Of the future we certainly know nothing; but we may form conjectures from the past; and the power of forming conjectures, includes, in my opinion, the duty of acting in conformity to that probability which we discover. Providence gives the power, of which reason teaches the use.</p>

<p class="p24">&lsquo;I hope I shall get some ground now with Mrs. Boswell; make my compliments to her, and to the little people.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t burn papers; they may be safe enough in your own box, &mdash; you will wish to see them hereafter.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">To THE SAME.</p>
