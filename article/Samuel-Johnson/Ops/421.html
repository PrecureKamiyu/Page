<title>FALL OF FIERS</title>

<h2 class="h20"><a id="a889"></a>FALL OF FIERS</h2>
<p class="p21">Towards evening we crossed, by a bridge, the river which makes the celebrated fall of Fiers.&nbsp; The country at the bridge strikes the imagination with all the gloom and grandeur of Siberian solitude.&nbsp; The way makes a flexure, and the mountains, covered with trees, rise at once on the left hand and in the front.&nbsp; We desired our guides to shew us the fall, and dismounting, clambered over very rugged crags, till I began to wish that our curiosity might have been gratified with less trouble and danger.&nbsp; We came at last to a place where we could overlook the river, and saw a channel torn, as it seems, through black piles of stone, by which the stream is obstructed and broken, till it comes to a very steep descent, of such dreadful depth, that we were naturally inclined to turn aside our eyes.</p>
<p class="p24">But we visited the place at an unseasonable time, and found it divested of its dignity and terror.&nbsp; Nature never gives every thing at once.&nbsp; A long continuance of dry weather, which made the rest of the way easy and delightful, deprived us of the pleasure expected from the fall of Fiers.&nbsp; The river having now no water but what the springs supply, showed us only a swift current, clear and shallow, fretting over the asperities of the rocky bottom, and we were left to exercise our thoughts, by endeavouring to conceive the effect of a thousand streams poured from the mountains into one channel, struggling for expansion in a narrow passage, exasperated by rocks rising in their way, and at last discharging all their violence of waters by a sudden fall through the horrid chasm.</p>
<p class="p24">The way now grew less easy, descending by an uneven declivity, but without either dirt or danger.&nbsp; We did not arrive at Fort Augustus till it was late.&nbsp; Mr. Boswell, who, between his father&rsquo;s merit and his own, is sure of reception wherever he comes, sent a servant before to beg admission and entertainment for that night.&nbsp; Mr. Trapaud, the governor, treated us with that courtesy which is so closely connected with the military character.&nbsp; He came out to meet us beyond the gates, and apologized that, at so late an hour, the rules of a garrison suffered him to give us entrance only at the postern.</p>
