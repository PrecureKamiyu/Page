<p class="p24">The gentleman being gone, and Dr. Johnson having left the room for some time, a debate arose between the Reverend Mr. Stockdale and Mrs. Desmoulins, whether Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander were entitled to any share of glory from their expedition. When Dr. Johnson returned to us, I told him the subject of their dispute. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, it was properly for botany that they went out: I believe they thought only of culling of simples.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I thanked him for showing civilities to Beattie. &lsquo;Sir, (said he,) I should thank <span class="t8">you</span>. We all love Beattie. Mrs. Thrale says, if ever she has another husband, she&rsquo;ll have Beattie. He sunk upon us that he was married; else we should have shewn his lady more civilities. She is a very fine woman. But how can you shew civilities to a non-entity? I did not think he had been married. Nay, I did not think about it one way or other; but he did not tell us of his lady till late.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He then spoke of St. Kilda, the most remote of the Hebrides. I told him, I thought of buying it. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Pray do, Sir. We will go and pass a winter amid the blasts there. We shall have fine fish, and we will take some dried tongues with us, and some books. We will have a strong built vessel, and some Orkney men to navigate her. We must build a tolerable house: but we may carry with us a wooden house ready made, and requiring nothing but to be put up. Consider, Sir, by buying St. Kilda, you may keep the people from falling into worse hands. We must give them a clergyman, and he shall be one of Beattie&rsquo;s choosing. He shall be educated at Marischal College. I&rsquo;ll be your Lord Chancellor, or what you please.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Are you serious, Sir, in advising me to buy St. Kilda? for if you should advise me to go to Japan, I believe I should do it.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why yes, Sir, I am serious.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Why then, I&rsquo;ll see what can be done.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I gave him an account of the two parties in the Church of Scotland, those for supporting the rights of patrons, independent of the people, and those against it. JOHNSON. &lsquo;It should be settled one way or other. I cannot wish well to a popular election of the clergy, when I consider that it occasions such animosities, such unworthy courting of the people, such slanders between the contending parties, and other disadvantages. It is enough to allow the people to remonstrate against the nomination of a minister for solid reasons.&rsquo; (I suppose he meant heresy or immorality.)</p>
<p class="p24">He was engaged to dine abroad, and asked me to return to him in the evening, at nine, which I accordingly did.</p>
<p class="p24">We drank tea with Mrs. Williams, who told us a story of second sight, which happened in Wales where she was born. He listened to it very attentively, and said he should be glad to have some instances of that faculty well authenticated. His elevated wish for more and more evidence for spirit, in opposition to the groveling belief of materialism, led him to a love of such mysterious disquisitions. He again justly observed, that we could have no certainty of the truth of supernatural appearances, unless something was told us which we could not know by ordinary means, or something done which could not be done but by supernatural power; that Pharaoh in reason and justice required such evidence from Moses; nay, that our Saviour said, &lsquo;If I had not done among them the works which none other man did, they had not had sin.&rsquo; He had said in the morning, that Macaulay&rsquo;s <span class="t8">History of St. Kilda</span>, was very well written, except some foppery about liberty and slavery. I mentioned to him that Macaulay told me, he was advised to leave out of his book the wonderful story that upon the approach of a stranger all the inhabitants catch cold; but that it had been so well authenticated, he determined to retain it. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, to leave things out of a book, merely because people tell you they will not be believed, is meanness. Macaulay acted with more magnanimity.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">We talked of the Roman Catholick religion, and how little difference there was in essential matters between ours and it. JOHNSON. &lsquo;True, Sir; all denominations of Christians have really little difference in point of doctrine, though they may differ widely in external forms. There is a prodigious difference between the external form of one of your Presbyterian churches in Scotland, and a church in Italy; yet the doctrine taught is essentially the same.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I mentioned the petition to Parliament for removing the subscription to the Thirty-nine Articles. JOHNSON. &lsquo;It was soon thrown out. Sir, they talk of not making boys at the University subscribe to what they do not understand; but they ought to consider, that our Universities were founded to bring up members for the Church of England, and we must not supply our enemies with arms from our arsenal. No, Sir, the meaning of subscribing is, not that they fully understand all the articles, but that they will adhere to the Church of England. Now take it in this way, and suppose that they should only subscribe their adherence to the Church of England, there would be still the same difficulty; for still the young men would be subscribing to what they do not understand. For if you should ask them, what do you mean by the Church of England? Do you know in what it differs from the Presbyterian Church? from the Romish Church? from the Greek Church? from the Coptick Church? they could not tell you. So, Sir, it comes to the same thing.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;But, would it not be sufficient to subscribe the Bible?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why no, Sir; for all sects will subscribe the Bible; nay, the Mahometans will subscribe the Bible; for the Mahometans acknowledge JESUS CHRIST, as well as Moses, but maintain that GOD sent Mahomet as a still greater prophet than either.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I mentioned the motion which had been made in the House of Commons, to abolish the fast of the 30th of January. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, I could have wished that it had been a temporary act, perhaps, to have expired with the century. I am against abolishing it; because that would be declaring it wrong to establish it; but I should have no objection to make an act, continuing it for another century, and then letting it expire.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He disapproved of the Royal Marriage Bill; &lsquo;Because (said he) I would not have the people think that the validity of marriage depends on the will of man, or that the right of a King depends on the will of man. I should not have been against making the marriage of any of the royal family without the approbation of King and Parliament, highly criminal.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">In the morning we had talked of old families, and the respect due to them. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, you have a right to that kind of respect, and are arguing for yourself. I am for supporting the principle, and am disinterested in doing it, as I have no such right.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Why, Sir, it is one more incitement to a man to do well.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Yes, Sir, and it is a matter of opinion, very necessary to keep society together. What is it but opinion, by which we have a respect for authority, that prevents us, who are the rabble, from rising up and pulling down you who are gentlemen from your places, and saying &ldquo;We will be gentlemen in our turn&rdquo;? Now, Sir, that respect for authority is much more easily granted to a man whose father has had it, than to an upstart, and so Society is more easily supported.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Perhaps, Sir, it might be done by the respect belonging to office, as among the Romans, where the dress, the toga, inspired reverence.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, we know very little about the Romans. But, surely, it is much easier to respect a man who has always had respect, than to respect a man who we know was last year no better than ourselves, and will be no better next year. In republicks there is not a respect for authority, but a fear of power.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;At present, Sir, I think riches seem to gain most respect.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;No, Sir, riches do not gain hearty respect; they only procure external attention. A very rich man, from low beginnings, may buy his election in a borough; but, <span class="t8">caeteris paribus</span>, a man of family will be preferred. People will prefer a man for whose father their fathers have voted, though they should get no more money, or even less. That shows that the respect for family is not merely fanciful, but has an actual operation. If gentlemen of family would allow the rich upstarts to spend their money profusely, which they are ready enough to do, and not vie with them in expence, the upstarts would soon be at an end, and the gentlemen would remain: but if the gentlemen will vie in expence with the upstarts, which is very foolish, they must be ruined.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I gave him an account of the excellent mimickry of a friend of mine in Scotland; observing, at the same time, that some people thought it a very mean thing. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, it is making a very mean use of a man&rsquo;s powers. But to be a good mimick, requires great powers; great acuteness of observation, great retention of what is observed, and great pliancy of organs, to represent what is observed. I remember a lady of quality in this town, Lady &mdash;&mdash;&nbsp; &mdash;&mdash; , who was a wonderful mimick, and used to make me laugh immoderately. I have heard she is now gone mad.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;It is amazing how a mimick can not only give you the gestures and voice of a person whom he represents; but even what a person would say on any particular subject.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, you are to consider that the manner and some particular phrases of a person do much to impress you with an idea of him, and you are not sure that he would say what the mimick says in his character.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think Foote a good mimick, Sir.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;No, Sir; his imitations are not like. He gives you something different from himself, but not the character which he means to assume. He goes out of himself, without going into other people. He cannot take off any person unless he is strongly marked, such as George Faulkner. He is like a painter, who can draw the portrait of a man who has a wen upon his face, and who, therefore, is easily known. If a man hops upon one leg, Foote can hop upon one leg. But he has not that nice discrimination which your friend seems to possess. Foote is, however, very entertaining, with a kind of conversation between wit and buffoonery.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Monday, March 23, I found him busy, preparing a fourth edition of his folio Dictionary. Mr. Peyton, one of his original amanuenses, was writing for him. I put him in mind of a meaning of the word <span class="t8">side</span>, which he had omitted, viz. relationship; as father&rsquo;s side, mother&rsquo;s side. He inserted it. I asked him if <span class="t8">humiliating</span> was a good word. He said, he had seen it frequently used, but he did not know it to be legitimate English. He would not admit <span class="t8">civilization</span>, but only <span class="t8">civility</span>. With great deference to him, I thought <span class="t8">civilization</span>, from <span class="t8">to civilize</span> better in the sense opposed to <span class="t8">barbarity</span>, than <span class="t8">civility</span>; as it is better to have a distinct word for each sense, than one word with two senses, which <span class="t8">civility</span> is, in his way of using it.</p>
<p class="p24">He seemed also to be intent on some sort of chymical operation. I was entertained by observing how he contrived to send Mr. Peyton on an errand, without seeming to degrade him. &lsquo;Mr. Peyton, &mdash; Mr. Peyton, will you be so good as to take a walk to Temple-Bar? You will there see a chymist&rsquo;s shop; at which you will be pleased to buy for me an ounce of oil of vitriol; not spirit of vitriol, but oil of vitriol. It will cost three half-pence.&rsquo; Peyton immediately went, and returned with it, and told him it cost but a penny.</p>
<p class="p24">I then reminded him of the schoolmaster&rsquo;s cause, and proposed to read to him the printed papers concerning it. &lsquo;No, Sir, (said he,) I can read quicker than I can hear.&rsquo; So he read them to himself.</p>
<p class="p24">After he had read for some time, we were interrupted by the entrance of Mr. Kristrom, a Swede, who was tutor to some young gentlemen in the city. He told me, that there was a very good History of Sweden, by Daline. Having at that time an intention of writing the history of that country, I asked Dr. Johnson whether one might write a history of Sweden, without going thither. &lsquo;Yes, Sir, (said he,) one for common use.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">We talked of languages. Johnson observed, that Leibnitz had made some progress in a work, tracing all languages up to the Hebrew. &lsquo;Why, Sir, (said he,) you would not imagine that the French <span class="t8">jour</span>, day, is derived from the Latin <span class="t8">dies</span>, and yet nothing is more certain; and the intermediate steps are very clear. From <span class="t8">dies</span>, comes <span class="t8">diurnus</span>. <span class="t8">Diu</span> is, by inaccurate ears, or inaccurate pronunciation, easily confounded with <span class="t8">giu</span>; then the Italians form a substantive of the ablative of an adjective, and thence <span class="t8">giurno</span>, or, as they make it, <span class="t8">giorno</span>; which is readily contracted into <span class="t8">giour</span>, or <span class="t8">jour</span>&rsquo; He observed, that the Bohemian language was true Sclavonick. The Swede said, it had some similarity with the German. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, to be sure, such parts of Sclavonia as confine with Germany, will borrow German words; and such parts as confine with Tartary will borrow Tartar words.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He said, he never had it properly ascertained that the Scotch Highlanders and the Irish understood each other. I told him that my cousin Colonel Graham, of the Royal Highlanders, whom I met at Drogheda, told me they did. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, if the Highlanders understood Irish, why translate the New Testament into Erse, as was done lately at Edinburgh, when there is an Irish translation?&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Although the Erse and Irish are both dialects of the same language, there may be a good deal of diversity between them, as between the different dialects in Italy.&rsquo; &mdash; The Swede went away, and Mr. Johnson continued his reading of the papers. I said, &lsquo;I am afraid, Sir, it is troublesome.&rsquo; &lsquo;Why, Sir, (said he,) I do not take much delight in it; but I&rsquo;ll go through it.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">We went to the Mitre, and dined in the room where he and I first supped together. He gave me great hopes of my cause. &lsquo;Sir, (said he,) the government of a schoolmaster is somewhat of the nature of military government; that is to say, it must be arbitrary, it must be exercised by the will of one man, according to particular circumstances. You must shew some learning upon this occasion. You must shew, that a schoolmaster has a prescriptive right to beat; and that an action of assault and battery cannot be admitted against him, unless there is some great excess, some barbarity. This man has maimed none of his boys. They are all left with the full exercise of their corporeal faculties. In our schools in England, many boys have been maimed; yet I never heard of an action against a schoolmaster on that account. Puffendorf, I think, maintains the right of a schoolmaster to beat his scholars.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Saturday, March 27, I introduced to him Sir Alexander Macdonald, with whom he had expressed a wish to be acquainted. He received him very courteously.</p>
<p class="p24">Sir Alexander observed, that the Chancellors in England are chosen from views much inferiour to the office, being chosen from temporary political views. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, in such a government as ours, no man is appointed to an office because he is the fittest for it, nor hardly in any other government; because there are so many connections and dependencies to be studied. A despotick prince may choose a man to an office, merely because he is the fittest for it. The King of Prussia may do it.&rsquo; SIR A. &lsquo;I think, Sir, almost all great lawyers, such at least as have written upon law, have known only law, and nothing else.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why no, Sir; Judge Hale was a great lawyer, and wrote upon law; and yet he knew a great many other things, and has written upon other things. Selden too.&rsquo; SIR A. &lsquo;Very true, Sir; and Lord Bacon. But was not Lord Coke a mere lawyer?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, I am afraid he was; but he would have taken it very ill if you had told him so. He would have prosecuted you for scandal.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Lord Mansfield is not a mere lawyer.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;No, Sir. I never was in Lord Mansfield&rsquo;s company; but Lord Mansfield was distinguished at the University. Lord Mansfield, when he first came to town, &ldquo;drank champagne with the wits,&rdquo; as Prior says. He was the friend of Pope.&rsquo; SIR A. &lsquo;Barristers, I believe, are not so abusive now as they were formerly. I fancy they had less law long ago, and so were obliged to take to abuse, to fill up the time. Now they have such a number of precedents, they have no occasion for abuse.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Nay, Sir, they had more law long ago than they have now. As to precedents, to be sure they will increase in course of time; but the more precedents there are, the less occasion is there for law; that is to say, the less occasion is there for investigating principles.&rsquo; SIR A. &lsquo;I have been correcting several Scotch accents in my friend Boswell. I doubt, Sir, if any Scotchman ever attains to a perfect English pronunciation.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, few of them do, because they do not persevere after acquiring a certain degree of it. But, Sir, there can be no doubt that they may attain to a perfect English pronunciation, if they will. We find how near they come to it; and certainly, a man who conquers nineteen parts of the Scottish accent, may conquer the twentieth. But, Sir, when a man has got the better of nine tenths he grows weary, he relaxes his diligence, he finds he has corrected his accent so far as not to be disagreeable, and he no longer desires his friends to tell him when he is wrong; nor does he choose to be told. Sir, when people watch me narrowly, and I do not watch myself, they will find me out to be of a particular county. In the same manner, Dunning may be found out to be a Devonshire man. So most Scotchmen may be found out. But, Sir, little aberrations are of no disadvantage. I never catched Mallet in a Scotch accent; and yet Mallet, I suppose, was past five-and-twenty before he came to London.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Upon another occasion I talked to him on this subject, having myself taken some pains to improve my pronunciation, by the aid of the late Mr. Love, of Drury-lane theatre, when he was a player at Edinburgh, and also of old Mr. Sheridan. Johnson said to me, &lsquo;Sir, your pronunciation is not offensive.&rsquo; With this concession I was pretty well satisfied; and let me give my countrymen of North-Britain an advice not to aim at absolute perfection in this respect; not to speak <span class="t8">High English</span>, as we are apt to call what is far removed from the <span class="t8">Scotch</span>, but which is by no means <span class="t8">good English</span>, and makes, &lsquo;the fools who use it,&rsquo; truly ridiculous. Good English is plain, easy, and smooth in the mouth of an unaffected English Gentleman. A studied and factitious pronunciation, which requires perpetual attention and imposes perpetual constraint, is exceedingly disgusting. A small intermixture of provincial peculiarities may, perhaps, have an agreeable effect, as the notes of different birds concur in the harmony of the grove, and please more than if they were all exactly alike. I could name some gentlemen of Ireland, to whom a slight proportion of the accent and recitative of that country is an advantage. The same observation will apply to the gentlemen of Scotland. I do not mean that we should speak as broad as a certain prosperous member of Parliament from that country; though it has been well observed, that &lsquo;it has been of no small use to him; as it rouses the attention of the House by its uncommonness; and is equal to tropes and figures in a good English speaker.&rsquo; I would give as an instance of what I mean to recommend to my countrymen, the pronunciation of the late Sir Gilbert Elliot; and may I presume to add that of the present Earl of Marchmont, who told me, with great good humour, that the master of a shop in London, where he was not known, said to him, &lsquo;I suppose, Sir, you are an American.&rsquo; &lsquo;Why so, Sir?&rsquo; (said his Lordship.) &lsquo;Because, Sir, (replied the shopkeeper,) you speak neither English nor Scotch, but something different from both, which I conclude is the language of America.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">BOSWELL. &lsquo;It may be of use, Sir, to have a Dictionary to ascertain the pronunciation.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, my Dictionary shows you the accents of words, if you can but remember them.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;But, Sir, we want marks to ascertain the pronunciation of the vowels. Sheridan, I believe, has finished such a work.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, consider how much easier it is to learn a language by the ear, than by any marks. Sheridan&rsquo;s Dictionary may do very well; but you cannot always carry it about with you: and, when you want the word, you have not the Dictionary. It is like a man who has a sword that will not draw. It is an admirable sword, to be sure: but while your enemy is cutting your throat, you are unable to use it. Besides, Sir, what entitles Sheridan to fix the pronunciation of English? He has, in the first place, the disadvantage of being an Irishman: and if he says he will fix it after the example of the best company, why they differ among themselves. I remember an instance: when I published the Plan for my Dictionary, Lord Chesterfield told me that the word <span class="t8">great</span> should be pronounced so as to rhyme to <span class="t8">state</span>; and Sir William Yonge sent me word that it should be pronounced so as to rhyme to <span class="t8">seat</span>, and that none but an Irishman would pronounce it <span class="t8">grait</span>. Now here were two men of the highest rank, the one, the best speaker in the House of Lords, the other, the best speaker in the House of Commons, differing entirely.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I again visited him at night. Finding him in a very good humour, I ventured to lead him to the subject of our situation in a future state, having much curiosity to know his notions on that point. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, the happiness of an unembodied spirit will consist in a consciousness of the favour of GOD, in the contemplation of truth, and in the possession of felicitating ideas.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;But, Sir, is there any harm in our forming to ourselves conjectures as to the particulars of our happiness, though the scripture has said but very little on the subject? &ldquo;We know not what we shall be.&rdquo;&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, there is no harm. What philosophy suggests to us on this topick is probable: what scripture tells us is certain. Dr. Henry More has carried it as far as philosophy can. You may buy both his theological and philosophical works in two volumes folio, for about eight shillings.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;One of the most pleasing thoughts is, that we shall see our friends again.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Yes, Sir; but you must consider, that when we are become purely rational, many of our friendships will be cut off. Many friendships are formed by a community of sensual pleasures: all these will be cut off. We form many friendships with bad men, because they have agreeable qualities, and they can be useful to us; but, after death, they can no longer be of use to us. We form many friendships by mistake, imagining people to be different from what they really are. After death, we shall see every one in a true light. Then, Sir, they talk of our meeting our relations: but then all relationship is dissolved; and we shall have no regard for one person more than another, but for their real value. However, we shall either have the satisfaction of meeting our friends, or be satisfied without meeting them.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Yet, Sir, we see in scripture, that Dives still retained an anxious concern about his brethren.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, we must either suppose that passage to be metaphorical, or hold with many divines, and all the Purgatorians that departed souls do not all at once arrive at the utmost perfection of which they are capable.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;I think, Sir, that is a very rational supposition.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, yes, Sir; but we do not know it is a true one. There is no harm in believing it: but you must not compel others to make it an article of faith; for it is not revealed.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Do you think, Sir, it is wrong in a man who holds the doctrine of purgatory, to pray for the souls of his deceased friends?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, no, Sir.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;I have been told, that in the Liturgy of the Episcopal Church of Scotland, there was a form of prayer for the dead.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, it is not in the liturgy which Laud framed for the Episcopal Church of Scotland: if there is a liturgy older than that, I should be glad to see it.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;As to our employment in a future state, the sacred writings say little. The Revelation, however, of St. John gives us many ideas, and particularly mentions musick.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, ideas must be given you by means of something which you know: and as to musick there are some philosophers and divines who have maintained that we shall not be spiritualized to such a degree, but that something of matter, very much refined, will remain. In that case, musick may make a part of our future felicity.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">BOSWELL. &lsquo;I do not know whether there are any well-attested stories of the appearance of ghosts. You know there is a famous story of the appearance of Mrs. Veal, prefixed to <span class="t8">Drelincourt on Death</span>.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;I believe, Sir, that is given up. I believe the woman declared upon her death-bed that it was a lie.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;This objection is made against the truth of ghosts appearing: that if they are in a state of happiness, it would be a punishment to them to return to this world; and if they are in a state of misery, it would be giving them a respite.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, as the happiness or misery of embodied spirits does not depend upon place, but is intellectual, we cannot say that they are less happy or less miserable by appearing upon earth.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">We went down between twelve and one to Mrs. Williams&rsquo;s room, and drank tea. I mentioned that we were to have the remains of Mr. Gray, in prose and verse, published by Mr. Mason. JOHNSON. &lsquo;I think we have had enough of Gray. I see they have published a splendid edition of Akenside&rsquo;s works. One bad ode may be suffered; but a number of them together makes one sick.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Akenside&rsquo;s distinguished poem is his <span class="t8">Pleasures of Imagination</span>: but for my part, I never could admire it so much as most people do.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, I could not read it through.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;I have read it through; but I did not find any great power in it.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I mentioned Elwal, the heretick, whose trial Sir John Pringle had given me to read. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, Mr. Elwal was, I think, an ironmonger at Wolverhampton; and he had a mind to make himself famous, by being the founder of a new sect, which he wished much should be called <span class="t8">Elwallians</span>. He held, that every thing in the Old Testament that was not typical, was to be of perpetual observance; and so he wore a ribband in the plaits of his coat, and he also wore a beard. I remember I had the honour of dining in company with Mr. Elwal. There was one Barter, a miller, who wrote against him; and you had the controversy between Mr. ELWAL and Mr. BARTER. To try to make himself distinguished, he wrote a letter to King George the Second, challenging him to dispute with him, in which he said, &ldquo;George, if you be afraid to come by yourself, to dispute with a poor old man, you may bring a thousand of your <span class="t8">black</span>-guards with you; and if you should still be afraid, you may bring a thousand of your <span class="t8">red</span>-guards.&rdquo; The letter had something of the impudence of Junius to our present King. But the men of Wolverhampton were not so inflammable as the Common-Council of London; so Mr. Elwal failed in his scheme of making himself a man of great consequence.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Tuesday, March 31, he and I dined at General Paoli&rsquo;s. A question was started, whether the state of marriage was natural to man. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, it is so far from being natural for a man and woman to live in a state of marriage, that we find all the motives which they have for remaining in that connection, and the restraints which civilized society imposes to prevent separation, are hardly sufficient to keep them together.&rsquo; The General said, that in a state of nature a man and woman uniting together, would form a strong and constant affection, by the mutual pleasure each would receive; and that the same causes of dissention would not arise between them, as occur between husband and wife in a civilized state. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, they would have dissentions enough, though of another kind. One would choose to go a hunting in this wood, the other in that; one would choose to go a fishing in this lake, the other in that; or, perhaps, one would choose to go a hunting, when the other would choose to go a fishing; and so they would part. Besides, Sir, a savage man and a savage woman meet by chance; and when the man sees another woman that pleases him better, he will leave the first.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">We then fell into a disquisition whether there is any beauty independent of utility. The General maintained there was not. Dr. Johnson maintained that there was; and he instanced a coffee-cup which he held in his hand, the painting of which was of no real use, as the cup would hold the coffee equally well if plain; yet the painting was beautiful.</p>
<p class="p24">We talked of the strange custom of swearing in conversation. The General said, that all barbarous nations swore from a certain violence of temper, that could not be confined to earth, but was always reaching at the powers above. He said, too, that there was greater variety of swearing, in proportion as there was a greater variety of religious ceremonies.</p>
<p class="p24">Dr. Johnson went home with me to my lodgings in Conduit-street and drank tea, previous to our going to the Pantheon, which neither of us had seen before.</p>
<p class="p24">He said, &lsquo;Goldsmith&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Life of Parnell</span> is poor; not that it is poorly written, but that he had poor materials; for nobody can write the life of a man, but those who have eat and drunk and lived in social intercourse with him.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I said, that if it was not troublesome and presuming too much, I would request him to tell me all the little circumstances of his life; what schools he attended, when he came to Oxford, when he came to London, &amp;c. &amp;c. He did not disapprove of my curiosity as to these particulars; but said, &lsquo;They&rsquo;ll come out by degrees as we talk together.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He censured Ruffhead&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Life of Pope</span>; and said, &lsquo;he knew nothing of Pope, and nothing of poetry.&rsquo; He praised Dr. Joseph Warton&rsquo;s Essay on Pope; but said, he supposed we should have no more of it, as the authour had not been able to persuade the world to think of Pope as he did. BOSWELL. &lsquo;Why, Sir, should that prevent him from continuing his work? He is an ingenious Counsel, who has made the most of his cause: he is not obliged to gain it.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;But, Sir, there is a difference when the cause is of a man&rsquo;s own making.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">We talked of the proper use of riches. JOHNSON. &lsquo;If I were a man of a great estate, I would drive all the rascals whom I did not like out of the county at an election.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I asked him how far he thought wealth should be employed in hospitality. JOHNSON. &lsquo;You are to consider that ancient hospitality, of which we hear so much, was in an uncommercial country, when men being idle, were glad to be entertained at rich men&rsquo;s tables. But in a commercial country, a busy country, time becomes precious, and therefore hospitality is not so much valued. No doubt there is still room for a certain degree of it; and a man has a satisfaction in seeing his friends eating and drinking around him. But promiscuous hospitality is not the way to gain real influence. You must help some people at table before others; you must ask some people how they like their wine oftener than others. You therefore offend more people than you please. You are like the French statesman, who said, when he granted a favour, &lsquo;<span class="t8">J&rsquo; ai fait dix mecontents et un ingrat</span>.&rsquo; Besides, Sir, being entertained ever so well at a man&rsquo;s table, impresses no lasting regard or esteem. No, Sir, the way to make sure of power and influence is, by lending money confidentially to your neighbours at a small interest, or, perhaps, at no interest at all, and having their bonds in your possession.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;May not a man, Sir, employ his riches to advantage in educating young men of merit?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Yes, Sir, if they fall in your way; but if it be understood that you patronize young men of merit, you will be harassed with solicitations. You will have numbers forced upon you who have no merit; some will force them upon you from mistaken partiality; and some from downright interested motives, without scruple; and you will be disgraced.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Were I a rich man, I would propagate all kinds of trees that will grow in the open air. A greenhouse is childish. I would introduce foreign animals into the country; for instance the reindeer.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">The conversation now turned on critical subjects. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Bayes, in <span class="t8">The Rehearsal</span>, is a mighty silly character. If it was intended to be like a particular man, it could only be diverting while that man was remembered. But I question whether it was meant for Dryden, as has been reported; for we know some of the passages said to be ridiculed, were written since <span class="t8">The Rehearsal</span>; at least a passage mentioned in the Preface is of a later date.&rsquo; I maintained that it had merit as a general satire on the self-importance of dramatick authours. But even in this light he held it very cheap.</p>
<p class="p24">We then walked to the Pantheon. The first view of it did not strike us so much as Ranelagh, of which he said, the &lsquo;<span class="t8">coup d&rsquo;oeil</span> was the finest thing he had ever seen.&rsquo; The truth is, Ranelagh is of a more beautiful form; more of it, or rather indeed the whole <span class="t8">rotunda</span>, appears at once, and it is better lighted. However, as Johnson observed, we saw the Pantheon in time of mourning, when there was a dull uniformity; whereas we had seen Ranelagh when the view was enlivened with a gay profusion of colours. Mrs. Bosville, of Gunthwait, in Yorkshire, joined us, and entered into conversation with us. Johnson said to me afterwards, &lsquo;Sir, this is a mighty intelligent lady.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I said there was not half a guinea&rsquo;s worth of pleasure in seeing this place. JOHNSON. &lsquo;But, Sir, there is half a guinea&rsquo;s worth of inferiority to other people in not having seen it.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;I doubt, Sir, whether there are many happy people here.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Yes, Sir, there are many happy people here. There are many people here who are watching hundreds, and who think hundreds are watching them.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Happening to meet Sir Adam Fergusson, I presented him to Dr. Johnson. Sir Adam expressed some apprehension that the Pantheon would encourage luxury. &lsquo;Sir, (said Johnson,) I am a great friend to publick amusements; for they keep people from vice. You now (addressing himself to me,) would have been with a wench, had you not been here. &mdash; O! I forgot you were married.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Sir Adam suggested, that luxury corrupts a people, and destroys the spirit of liberty. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, that is all visionary. I would not give half a guinea to live under one form of government rather than another. It is of no moment to the happiness of an individual. Sir, the danger of the abuse of power is nothing to a private man. What Frenchman is prevented from passing his life as he pleases?&rsquo; SIR ADAM. &lsquo;But, Sir, in the British constitution it is surely of importance to keep up a spirit in the people, so as to preserve a balance against the crown.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, I perceive you are a vile Whig. Why all this childish jealousy of the power of the crown? The crown has not power enough. When I say that all governments are alike, I consider that in no government power can be abused long. Mankind will not bear it. If a sovereign oppresses his people to a great degree, they will rise and cut off his head. There is a remedy in human nature against tyranny, that will keep us safe under every form of government. Had not the people of France thought themselves honoured as sharing in the brilliant actions of Lewis XIV, they would not have endured him; and we may say the same of the King of Prussia&rsquo;s people.&rsquo; Sir Adam introduced the ancient Greeks and Romans. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, the mass of both of them were barbarians. The mass of every people must be barbarous where there is no printing, and consequently knowledge is not generally diffused. Knowledge is diffused among our people by the news-papers.&rsquo; Sir Adam mentioned the orators, poets, and artists of Greece. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, I am talking of the mass of the people. We see even what the boasted Athenians were. The little effect which Demosthenes&rsquo;s orations had upon them, shews that they were barbarians.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Sir Adam was unlucky in his topicks; for he suggested a doubt of the propriety of Bishops having seats in the House of Lords. JOHNSON. &lsquo;How so, Sir? Who is more proper for having the dignity of a peer, than a Bishop, provided a Bishop be what he ought to be; and if improper Bishops be made, that is not the fault of the Bishops, but of those who make them.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Sunday, April 5, after attending divine service at St. Paul&rsquo;s church, I found him alone. Of a schoolmaster of his acquaintance, a native of Scotland, he said, &lsquo;He has a great deal of good about him; but he is also very defective in some respects. His inner part is good, but his outer part is mighty aukward. You in Scotland do not attain that nice critical skill in languages, which we get in our schools in England. I would not put a boy to him, whom I intended for a man of learning. But for the sons of citizens, who are to learn a little, get good morals, and then go to trade, he may do very well.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I mentioned a cause in which I had appeared as counsel at the bar of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, where a <span class="t8">Probationer</span>, (as one licensed to preach, but not yet ordained, is called,) was opposed in his application to be inducted, because it was alledged that he had been guilty of fornication five years before. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, if he has repented, it is not a sufficient objection. A man who is good enough to go to heaven, is good enough to be a clergyman.&rsquo; This was a humane and liberal sentiment. But the character of a clergyman is more sacred than that of an ordinary Christian. As he is to instruct with authority, he should be regarded with reverence, as one upon whom divine truth has had the effect to set him above such transgressions, as men less exalted by spiritual habits, and yet upon the whole not to be excluded from heaven, have been betrayed into by the predominance of passion. That clergymen may be considered as sinners in general, as all men are, cannot be denied; but this reflection will not counteract their good precepts so much, as the absolute knowledge of their having been guilty of certain specifick immoral acts. I told him, that by the rules of the Church of Scotland, in their <span class="t8">Book of Discipline</span>, if a <span class="t8">scandal</span>, as it is called, is not prosecuted for five years, it cannot afterwards be proceeded upon, &lsquo;unless it be of a <span class="t8">heinous nature</span>, or again become flagrant;&rsquo; and that hence a question arose, whether fornication was a sin of a heinous nature; and that I had maintained, that it did not deserve that epithet, in as much as it was not one of those sins which argue very great depravity of heart: in short, was not, in the general acceptation of mankind, a heinous sin. JOHNSON. &lsquo;No, Sir, it is not a heinous sin. A heinous sin is that for which a man is punished with death or banishment.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;But, Sir, after I had argued that it was not an heinous sin, an old clergyman rose up, and repeating the text of scripture denouncing judgement against whoremongers, asked, whether, considering this, there could be any doubt of fornication being a heinous sin.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, observe the word <span class="t8">whoremonger</span>. Every sin, if persisted in, will become heinous. Whoremonger is a dealer in whores, as ironmonger is a dealer in iron. But as you don&rsquo;t call a man an ironmonger for buying and selling a pen-knife; so you don&rsquo;t call a man a whoremonger for getting one wench with child.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I spoke of the inequality of the livings of the clergy in England, and the scanty provisions of some of the Curates. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why yes, Sir; but it cannot be helped. You must consider, that the revenues of the clergy are not at the disposal of the state, like the pay of the army. Different men have founded different churches; and some are better endowed, some worse. The State cannot interfere and make an equal division of what has been particularly appropriated. Now when a clergyman has but a small living, or even two small livings, he can afford very little to a curate.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He said, he went more frequently to church when there were prayers only, than when there was also a sermon, as the people required more an example for the one than the other; it being much easier for them to hear a sermon, than to fix their minds on prayer.</p>
<p class="p24">On Monday, April 6, I dined with him at Sir Alexander Macdonald&rsquo;s, where was a young officer in the regimentals of the Scots Royal, who talked with a vivacity, fluency, and precision so uncommon, that he attracted particular attention. He proved to be the Honourable Thomas Erskine, youngest brother to the Earl of Buchan, who has since risen into such brilliant reputation at the bar in Westminster-hall.</p>
<p class="p24">Fielding being mentioned, Johnson exclaimed, &lsquo;he was a blockhead;&rsquo; and upon my expressing my astonishment at so strange an assertion, he said, &lsquo;What I mean by his being a blockhead is that he was a barren rascal.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Will you not allow, Sir, that he draws very natural pictures of human life?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, it is of very low life. Richardson used to say, that had he not known who Fielding was, he should have believed he was an ostler. Sir, there is more knowledge of the heart in one letter of Richardson&rsquo;s, than in all <span class="t8">Tom Jones</span>. I, indeed, never read <span class="t8">Joseph Andrews</span>.&rsquo; ERSKINE, &lsquo;Surely, Sir, Richardson is very tedious.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, if you were to read Richardson for the story, your impatience would be so much fretted that you would hang yourself. But you must read him for the sentiment, and consider the story as only giving occasion to the sentiment.&rsquo; &mdash; I have already given my opinion of Fielding; but I cannot refrain from repeating here my wonder at Johnson&rsquo;s excessive and unaccountable depreciation of one of the best writers that England has produced. <span class="t8">Tom Jones</span> has stood the test of publick opinion with such success, as to have established its great merit, both for the story, the sentiments, and the manners, and also the varieties of diction, so as to leave no doubt of its having an animated truth of execution throughout.</p>
<p class="p24">A book of travels, lately published under the title of <span class="t8">Coriat Junior</span>, and written by Mr. Paterson, was mentioned. Johnson said, this book was an imitation of Sterne, and not of Coriat, whose name Paterson had chosen as a whimsical one. &lsquo;Tom Coriat, (said he,) was a humourist about the court of James the First. He had a mixture of learning, of wit, and of buffoonery. He first travelled through Europe, and published his travels. He afterwards travelled on foot through Asia, and had made many remarks; but he died at Mandoa, and his remarks were lost.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">We talked of gaming, and animadverted on it with severity. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Nay, gentlemen, let us not aggravate the matter. It is not roguery to play with a man who is ignorant of the game, while you are master of it, and so win his money; for he thinks he can play better than you, as you think you can play better than he; and the superiour skill carries it.&rsquo; ERSKINE. &lsquo;He is a fool, but you are not a rogue.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;That&rsquo;s much about the truth, Sir. It must be considered, that a man who only does what every one of the society to which he belongs would do, is not a dishonest man. In the republick of Sparta, it was agreed, that stealing was not dishonourable, if not discovered. I do not commend a society where there is an agreement that what would not otherwise be fair, shall be fair; but I maintain, that an individual of any society, who practises what is allowed, is not a dishonest man.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;So then, Sir, you do not think ill of a man who wins perhaps forty thousand pounds in a winter?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, I do not call a gamester a dishonest man; but I call him an unsocial man, an unprofitable man. Gaming is a mode of transferring property without producing any intermediate good. Trade gives employment to numbers, and so produces intermediate good.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Mr. Erskine told us, that when he was in the island of Minorca, he not only read prayers, but preached two sermons to the regiment. He seemed to object to the passage in scripture where we are told that the angel of the Lord smote in one night forty thousand Assyrians. &lsquo;Sir, (said Johnson,) you should recollect that there was a supernatural interposition; they were destroyed by pestilence. You are not to suppose that the angel of the LORD went about and stabbed each of them with a dagger, or knocked them on the head, man by man.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">After Mr. Erskine was gone, a discussion took place, whether the present Earl of Buchan, when Lord Cardross, did right to refuse to go Secretary of the Embassy to Spain, when Sir James Gray, a man of inferiour rank, went Ambassadour. Dr. Johnson said, that perhaps in point of interest he did wrong; but in point of dignity he did well. Sir Alexander insisted that he was wrong; and said that Mr. Pitt intended it as an advantageous thing for him. &lsquo;Why, Sir, (said Johnson,) Mr. Pitt might think it an advantageous thing for him to make him a vintner, and get him all the Portugal trade; but he would have demeaned himself strangely had he accepted of such a situation. Sir, had he gone Secretary while his inferiour was Ambassadour, he would have been a traitor to his rank and family.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I talked of the little attachment which subsisted between near relations in London. &lsquo;Sir, (said Johnson,) in a country so commercial as ours, where every man can do for himself, there is not so much occasion for that attachment. No man is thought the worse of here, whose brother was hanged. In uncommercial countries, many of the branches of a family must depend on the stock; so, in order to make the head of the family take care of them, they are represented as connected with his reputation, that, self-love being interested, he may exert himself to promote their interest. You have first large circles, or clans; as commerce increases, the connection is confined to families. By degrees, that too goes off, as having become unnecessary, and there being few opportunities of intercourse. One brother is a merchant in the city, and another is an officer in the guards. How little intercourse can these two have!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I argued warmly for the old feudal system. Sir Alexander opposed it, and talked of the pleasure of seeing all men free and independent. JOHNSON. &lsquo;I agree with Mr. Boswell that there must be a high satisfaction in being a feudal Lord; but we are to consider, that we ought not to wish to have a number of men unhappy for the satisfaction of one.&rsquo; &mdash; I maintained that numbers, namely, the vassals or followers, were not unhappy; for that there was a reciprocal satisfaction between the Lord and them: he being kind in his authority over them; they being respectful and faithful to him.</p>
<p class="p24">On Thursday, April 9, I called on him to beg he would go and dine with me at the Mitre tavern. He had resolved not to dine at all this day, I know not for what reason; and I was so unwilling to be deprived of his company, that I was content to submit to suffer a want, which was at first somewhat painful, but he soon made me forget it; and a man is always pleased with himself when he finds his intellectual inclinations predominate.</p>
<p class="p24">He observed, that to reason philosophically on the nature of prayer, was very unprofitable.</p>
<p class="p24">Talking of ghosts, he said, he knew one friend, who was an honest man and a sensible man, who told him he had seen a ghost, old Mr. Edward Cave, the printer at St. John&rsquo;s Gate. He said, Mr. Cave did not like to talk of it, and seemed to be in great horrour whenever it was mentioned. BOSWELL. &lsquo;Pray, Sir, what did he say was the appearance?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, something of a shadowy being.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I mentioned witches, and asked him what they properly meant. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, they properly mean those who make use of the aid of evil spirits.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;There is no doubt, Sir, a general report and belief of their having existed.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;You have not only the general report and belief, but you have many voluntary solemn confessions.&rsquo; He did not affirm anything positively upon a subject which it is the fashion of the times to laugh at as a matter of absurd credulity. He only seemed willing, as a candid enquirer after truth, however strange and inexplicable, to shew that he understood what might be urged for it.</p>
<p class="p24">On Friday, April 10, I dined with him at General Oglethorpe&rsquo;s, where we found Dr. Goldsmith.</p>
<p class="p24">Armorial bearings having been mentioned, Johnson said they were as ancient as the siege of Thebes, which he proved by a passage in one of the tragedies of Euripides.</p>
<p class="p24">I started the question whether duelling was consistent with moral duty. The brave old General fired at this, and said, with a lofty air, &lsquo;Undoubtedly a man has a right to defend his honour.&rsquo; GOLDSMITH, (turning to me.) &lsquo;I ask you first, Sir, what would you do if you were affronted?&rsquo; I answered I should think it necessary to fight. &lsquo;Why then, (replied Goldsmith,) that solves the question.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;No, Sir, it does not solve the question. It does not follow that what a man would do is therefore right.&rsquo; I said, I wished to have it settled, whether duelling was contrary to the laws of Christianity. Johnson immediately entered on the subject, and treated it in a masterly manner; and so far as I have been able to recollect, his thoughts were these: &lsquo;Sir, as men become in a high degree refined, various causes of offence arise; which are considered to be of such importance, that life must be staked to atone for them, though in reality they are not so. A body that has received a very fine polish may be easily hurt. Before men arrive at this artificial refinement, if one tells his neighbour he lies, his neighbour tells him he lies; if one gives his neighbour a blow, his neighbour gives him a blow: but in a state of highly polished society, an affront is held to be a serious injury. It must therefore be resented, or rather a duel must be fought upon it; as men have agreed to banish from their society one who puts up with an affront without fighting a duel. Now, Sir, it is never unlawful to fight in self-defence. He, then, who fights a duel, does not fight from passion against his antagonist, but out of self-defence; to avert the stigma of the world, and to prevent himself from being driven out of society. I could wish there was not that superfluity of refinement; but while such notions prevail, no doubt a man may lawfully fight a duel.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Let it be remembered, that this justification is applicable only to the person who <span class="t8">receives</span> an affront. All mankind must condemn the aggressor.</p>
<p class="p24">The General told us, that when he was a very young man, I think only fifteen, serving under Prince Eugene of Savoy, he was sitting in a company at table with a Prince of Wirtemberg, The Prince took up a glass of wine, and, by a fillip, made some of it fly in Oglethorpe&rsquo;s face. Here was a nice dilemma. To have challenged him instantly, might have fixed a quarrelsome character upon the young soldier: to have taken no notice of it might have been considered as cowardice. Oglethorpe, therefore, keeping his eye upon the Prince, and smiling all the time, as if he took what his Highness had done in jest, said &lsquo;Man Prince,&mdash; &lsquo;(I forget the French words he used, the purport however was.) &lsquo;That&rsquo;s a good joke; but we do it much better in England;&rsquo; and threw a whole glass of wine in the Prince&rsquo;s face. An old General who sat by, said, &lsquo;<span class="t8">Il a bien fait, mon Prince, vous l&rsquo;avez commencé</span>:&rsquo; and thus all ended in good humour.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Dr. Johnson said, &lsquo;Pray, General, give us an account of the siege of Belgrade.&rsquo; Upon which the General, pouring a little wine upon the table, described every thing with a wet finger: &lsquo;Here we were, here were the Turks,&rsquo; &amp;c. &amp;c. Johnson listened with the closest attention.</p>
<p class="p24">A question was started, how far people who disagree in a capital point can live in friendship together. Johnson said they might. Goldsmith said they could not, as they had not the <span class="t8">idem velle atque idem nolle</span> &mdash; the same likings and the same aversions. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, you must shun the subject as to which you disagree. For instance, I can live very well with Burke: I love his knowledge, his genius, his diffusion, and affluence of conversation; but I would not talk to him of the Rockingham party.&rsquo; GOLDSMITH. &lsquo;But, Sir, when people live together who have something as to which they disagree, and which they want to shun, they will be in the situation mentioned in the story of Bluebeard: &ldquo;You may look into all the chambers but one.&rdquo; But we should have the greatest inclination to look into that chamber, to talk of that subject.&rsquo; JOHNSON, (with a loud voice.) &lsquo;Sir, I am not saying that <span class="t8">you</span> could live in friendship with a man from whom you differ as to some point: I am only saying that <span class="t8">I</span> could do it. You put me in mind of Sappho in Ovid.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Goldsmith told us, that he was now busy in writing a natural history, and, that he might have full leisure for it, he had taken lodgings, at a farmer&rsquo;s house, near to the six mile-stone, on the Edgeware road, and had carried down his books in two returned post-chaises. He said, he believed the farmer&rsquo;s family thought him an odd character, similar to that in which the <span class="t8">Spectator</span> appeared to his landlady and her children: he was <span class="t8">The Gentleman</span>. Mr. Mickle, the translator of <span class="t8">The Lusiad</span>, and I went to visit him at this place a few days afterwards. He was not at home; but having a curiosity to see his apartment, we went in and found curious scraps of descriptions of animals, scrawled upon the wall with a black lead pencil.</p>
<p class="p24">The subject of ghosts being introduced, Johnson repeated what he had told me of a friend of his, an honest man, and a man of sense, having asserted to him, that he had seen an apparition. Goldsmith told us, he was assured by his brother, the Reverend Mr. Goldsmith, that he also had seen one. General Oglethorpe told us, that Prendergast, an officer in the Duke of Marlborough&rsquo;s army, had mentioned to many of his friends, that he should die on a particular day. That upon that day a battle took place with the French; that after it was over, and Prendergast was still alive, his brother officers, while they were yet in the field, jestingly asked him, where was his prophecy now. Prendergast gravely answered. &lsquo;I shall die, notwithstanding what you see.&rsquo; Soon afterwards, there came a shot from a French battery, to which the orders for a cessation of arms had not yet reached, and he was killed upon the spot. Colonel Cecil, who took possession of his effects, found in his pocket-book the following solemn entry:</p>
<p class="p24">[Here the date.] &lsquo;Dreamt &mdash; or &mdash;&mdash; . Sir John Friend meets me:&rsquo; (here the very day on which he was killed, was mentioned.) Prendergast had been connected with Sir John Friend, who was executed for high treason. General Oglethorpe said, he was with Colonel Cecil when Pope came and enquired into the truth of this story, which made a great noise at the time, and was then confirmed by the Colonel.</p>
<p class="p24">On Saturday, April 11, he appointed me to come to him in the evening, when he should be at leisure to give me some assistance for the defence of Hastie, the schoolmaster of Campbelltown, for whom I was to appear in the House of Lords. When I came, I found him unwilling to exert himself. I pressed him to write down his thoughts upon the subject. He said, &lsquo;There&rsquo;s no occasion for my writing. I&rsquo;ll talk to you.&rsquo; He was, however, at last prevailed on to dictate to me, while I wrote as follows: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The charge is, that he has used immoderate and cruel correction. Correction, in itself, is not cruel; children, being not reasonable, can be governed only by fear. To impress this fear, is therefore one of the first duties of those who have the care of children. It is the duty of a parent; and has never been thought inconsistent with parental tenderness. It is the duty of a master, who is in his highest exaltation when he is <span class="t8">loco parentis</span>. Yet, as good things become evil by excess, correction, by being immoderate, may become cruel. But when is correction immoderate? When it is more frequent or more severe than is required <span class="t8">ad monendum et docendum</span>, for reformation and instruction. No severity is cruel which obstinacy makes necessary; for the greatest cruelty would be to desist, and leave the scholar too careless for instruction, and too much hardened for reproof. Locke, in his treatise of Education, mentions a mother, with applause, who whipped an infant eight times before she had subdued it; for had she stopped at the seventh act of correction, her daughter, says he, would have been ruined. The degrees of obstinacy in young minds, are very different; as different must be the degrees of persevering severity. A stubborn scholar must be corrected till he is subdued. The discipline of a school is military. There must be either unbounded licence or absolute authority. The master, who punishes, not only consults the future happiness of him who is the immediate subject of correction; but he propagates obedience through the whole school; and establishes regularity by exemplary justice. The victorious obstinacy of a single boy would make his future endeavours of reformation or instruction totally ineffectual. Obstinacy, therefore, must never be victorious. Yet, it is well known, that there sometimes occurs a sullen and hardy resolution, that laughs at all common punishment, and bids defiance to all common degrees of pain. Correction must be proportioned to occasions. The flexible will be reformed by gentle discipline, and the refractory must be subdued by harsher methods. The degrees of scholastick, as of military punishment, no stated rules can ascertain. It must be enforced till it overpowers temptation; till stubbornness becomes flexible, and perverseness regular. Custom and reason have, indeed, set some bounds to scholastick penalties. The schoolmaster inflicts no capital punishments; nor enforces his edicts by either death or mutilation. The civil law has wisely determined, that a master who strikes at a scholar&rsquo;s eye shall be considered as criminal. But punishments, however severe, that produce no lasting evil, may be just and reasonable, because they may be necessary. Such have been the punishments used by the respondent. No scholar has gone from him either blind or lame, or with any of his limbs or powers injured or impaired. They were irregular, and he punished them: they were obstinate, and he enforced his punishment. But, however provoked, he never exceeded the limits of moderation, for he inflicted nothing beyond present pain; and how much of that was required, no man is so little able to determine as those who have determined against him; &mdash; the parents of the offenders. It has been said, that he used unprecedented and improper instruments of correction. Of this accusation the meaning is not very easy to be found. No instrument of correction is more proper than another, but as it is better adapted to produce present pain without lasting mischief. Whatever were his instruments, no lasting mischief has ensued; and therefore, however unusual, in hands so cautious they were proper. It has been objected, that the respondent admits the charge of cruelty, by producing no evidence to confute it. Let it be considered, that his scholars are either dispersed at large in the world, or continue to inhabit the place in which they were bred. Those who are dispersed cannot be found; those who remain are the sons of his persecutors, and are not likely to support a man to whom their fathers are enemies. If it be supposed that the enmity of their fathers proves the justice of the charge, it must be considered how often experience shews us, that men who are angry on one ground will accuse on another; with how little kindness, in a town of low trade, a man who lives by learning is regarded; and how implicitly, where the inhabitants are not very rich, a rich man is hearkened to and followed. In a place like Campbelltown, it is easy for one of the principal inhabitants to make a party. It is easy for that party to heat themselves with imaginary grievances. It is easy for them to oppress a man poorer than themselves; and natural to assert the dignity of riches, by persisting in oppression. The argument which attempts to prove the impropriety of restoring him to the school, by alledging that he has lost the confidence of the people, is not the subject of juridical consideration; for he is to suffer, if he must suffer, not for their judgement, but for his own actions. It may be convenient for them to have another master; but it is a convenience of their own making. It would be likewise convenient for him to find another school; but this convenience he cannot obtain. The question is not what is now convenient, but what is generally right. If the people of Campbelltown be distressed by the restoration of the respondent, they are distressed only by their own fault; by turbulent passions and unreasonable desires; by tyranny, which law has defeated, and by malice, which virtue has surmounted.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;This, Sir, (said he,) you are to turn in your mind, and make the best use of it you can in your speech.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Of our friend, Goldsmith, he said, &lsquo;Sir, he is so much afraid of being unnoticed, that he often talks merely lest you should forget that he is in the company.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Yes, he stands forward.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;True, Sir; but if a man is to stand forward, he should wish to do it not in an aukward posture, not in rags, not so as that he shall only be exposed to ridicule.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;For my part, I like very well to hear honest Goldsmith talk away carelessly.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why yes, Sir; but he should not like to hear himself.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Tuesday, April 14, the decree of the Court of Session in the schoolmaster&rsquo;s cause was reversed in the House of Lords, after a very eloquent speech by Lord Mansfield, who shewed himself an adept in school discipline, but I thought was too rigorous towards my client. On the evening of the next day I supped with Dr. Johnson, at the Crown and Anchor tavern, in the Strand, in company with Mr. Langton and his brother-in-law, Lord Binning. I repeated a sentence of Lord Mansfield&rsquo;s speech, of which, by the aid of Mr. Longlands, the solicitor on the other side, who obligingly allowed me to compare his note with my own, I have a full copy: &lsquo;My Lords, severity is not the way to govern either boys or men.&rsquo; &lsquo;Nay, (said Johnson,) it is the way to <span class="t8">govern</span> them. I know not whether it be the way to <span class="t8">mend</span> them.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I talked of the recent expulsion of six students from the University of Oxford, who were methodists and would not desist from publickly praying and exhorting. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, that expulsion was extremely just and proper. What have they to do at an University who are not willing to be taught, but will presume to teach? Where is religion to be learnt but at an University? Sir, they were examined, and found to be mighty ignorant fellows.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;But, was it not hard, Sir, to expel them, for I am told they were good beings?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;I believe they might be good beings; but they were not fit to be in the University of Oxford. A cow is a very good animal in the field; but we turn her out of a garden.&rsquo; Lord Elibank used to repeat this as an illustration uncommonly happy.</p>
<p class="p24">Desirous of calling Johnson forth to talk, and exercise his wit, though I should myself be the object of it, I resolutely ventured to undertake the defence of convivial indulgence in wine, though he was not to-night in the most genial humour. After urging the common plausible topicks, I at last had recourse to the maxim, <span class="t8">in vino veritas</span>, a man who is well warmed with wine will speak truth. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, that may be an argument for drinking, if you suppose men in general to be liars. But, Sir, I would not keep company with a fellow, who lyes as long as he is sober, and whom you must make drunk before you can get a word of truth out of him.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Mr. Langton told us he was about to establish a school upon his estate, but it had been suggested to him, that it might have a tendency to make the people less industrious. JOHNSON. &lsquo;No, Sir. While learning to read and write is a distinction, the few who have that distinction may be the less inclined to work; but when every body learns to read and write, it is no longer a distinction. A man who has a laced waistcoat is too fine a man to work; but if every body had laced waistcoats, we should have people working in laced waistcoats. There are no people whatever more industrious, none who work more, than our manufacturers; yet they have all learnt to read and write. Sir, you must not neglect doing a thing immediately good, from fear of remote evil; &mdash; from fear of its being abused. A man who has candles may sit up too late, which he would not do if he had not candles; but nobody will deny that the art of making candles, by which light is continued to us beyond the time that the sun gives us light, is a valuable art, and ought to be preserved.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;But, Sir, would it not be better to follow Nature; and go to bed and rise just as nature gives us light or with-holds it?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;No, Sir; for then we should have no kind of equality in the partition of our time between sleeping and waking. It would be very different in different seasons and in different places. In some of the northern parts of Scotland how little light is there in the depth of winter!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">We talked of Tacitus, and I hazarded an opinion, that with all his merit for penetration, shrewdness of judgement, and terseness of expression, he was too compact, too much broken into hints, as it were, and therefore too difficult to be understood. To my great satisfaction, Dr. Johnson sanctioned this opinion. &lsquo;Tacitus, Sir, seems to me rather to have made notes for an historical work, than to have written a history.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">At this time it appears from his <span class="t8">Prayers and Meditations</span>, that he had been more than commonly diligent in religious duties, particularly in reading the Holy Scriptures. It was Passion Week, that solemn season which the Christian world has appropriated to the commemoration of the mysteries of our redemption, and during which, whatever embers of religion are in our breasts, will be kindled into pious warmth.</p>
<p class="p24">I paid him short visits both on Friday and Saturday, and seeing his large folio Greek Testament before him, beheld him with a reverential awe, and would not intrude upon his time. While he was thus employed to such good purpose, and while his friends in their intercourse with him constantly found a vigorous intellect and a lively imagination, it is melancholy to read in his private register, &lsquo;My mind is unsettled and my memory confused. I have of late turned my thoughts with a very useless earnestness upon past incidents. I have yet got no command over my thoughts; an unpleasing incident is almost certain to hinder my rest.&rsquo; What philosophick heroism was it in him to appear with such manly fortitude to the world, while he was inwardly so distressed! We may surely believe that the mysterious principle of being &lsquo;made perfect through suffering&rsquo; was to be strongly exemplified in him.</p>
<p class="p24">On Sunday, April 19, being Easter-day, General Paoli and I paid him a visit before dinner. We talked of the notion that blind persons can distinguish colours by the touch. Johnson said, that Professor Sanderson mentions his having attempted to do it, but that he found he was aiming at an impossibility; that to be sure a difference in the surface makes the difference of colours; but that difference is so fine, that it is not sensible to the touch. The General mentioned jugglers and fraudulent gamesters, who could know cards by the touch. Dr. Johnson said, &lsquo;the cards used by such persons must be less polished than ours commonly are.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">We talked of sounds. The General said, there was no beauty in a simple sound, but only in an harmonious composition of sounds. I presumed to differ from this opinion, and mentioned the soft and sweet sound of a fine woman&rsquo;s voice. JOHNSON. &lsquo;No, Sir, if a serpent or a toad uttered it, you would think it ugly.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;So you would think, Sir, were a beautiful tune to be uttered by one of those animals.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;No, Sir, it would be admired. We have seen fine fiddlers whom we liked as little as toads.&rsquo; (laughing.)</p>
<p class="p24">Talking on the subject of taste in the arts, he said, that difference of taste was, in truth, difference of skill. BOSWELL. &lsquo;But, Sir, is there not a quality called taste, which consists merely in perception or in liking? For instance, we find people differ much as to what is the best style of English composition. Some think Swift&rsquo;s the best; others prefer a fuller and grander way of writing.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, you must first define what you mean by style, before you can judge who has a good taste in style, and who has a bad. The two classes of persons whom you have mentioned don&rsquo;t differ as to good and bad. They both agree that Swift has a good neat style; but one loves a neat style, another loves a style of more splendour. In like manner, one loves a plain coat, another loves a laced coat; but neither will deny that each is good in its kind.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">While I remained in London this spring, I was with him at several other times, both by himself and in company. I dined with him one day at the Crown and Anchor tavern, in the Strand, with Lord Elibank, Mr. Langton, and Dr. Vansittart of Oxford. Without specifying each particular day, I have preserved the following memorable things.</p>
<p class="p24">I regretted the reflection in his Preface to Shakspeare against Garrick, to whom we cannot but apply the following passage: &lsquo;I collated such copies as I could procure, and wished for more, but have not found the collectors of these rarities very communicative.&rsquo; I told him, that Garrick had complained to me of it, and had vindicated himself by assuring me, that Johnson was made welcome to the full use of his collection, and that he left the key of it with a servant, with orders to have a fire and every convenience for him. I found Johnson&rsquo;s notion was, that Garrick wanted to be courted for them, and that, on the contrary, Garrick should have courted him, and sent him the plays of his own accord. But, indeed, considering the slovenly and careless manner in which books were treated by Johnson, it could not be expected that scarce and valuable editions should have been lent to him.</p>
<p class="p24">A gentleman having to some of the usual arguments for drinking added this: &lsquo;You know, Sir, drinking drives away care, and makes us forget whatever is disagreeable. Would not you allow a man to drink for that reason?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Yes, Sir, if he sat next <span class="t8">you</span>.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I expressed a liking for Mr. Francis Osborne&rsquo;s works, and asked him what he thought of that writer. He answered, &lsquo;A conceited fellow. Were a man to write so now, the boys would throw stones at him.&rsquo; He, however, did not alter my opinion of a favourite authour, to whom I was first directed by his being quoted in The Spectator, and in whom I have found much shrewd and lively sense, expressed indeed in a style somewhat quaint, which, however, I do not dislike. His book has an air of originality. We figure to ourselves an ancient gentleman talking to us.</p>
<p class="p24">When one of his friends endeavoured to maintain that a country gentleman might contrive to pass his life very agreeably, &lsquo;Sir (said he,) you cannot give me an instance of any man who is permitted to lay out his own time, contriving not to have tedious hours.&rsquo; This observation, however, is equally applicable to gentlemen who live in cities, and are of no profession.</p>
<p class="p24">He said, &lsquo;there is no permanent national character; it varies according to circumstances. Alexander the Great swept India: now the Turks sweep Greece.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">A learned gentleman who in the course of conversation wished to inform us of this simple fact, that the Counsel upon the circuit at Shrewsbury were much bitten by fleas, took, I suppose, seven or eight minutes in relating it circumstantially. He in a plenitude of phrase told us, that large bales of woollen cloth were lodged in the town-hall; &mdash; that by reason of this, fleas nestled there in prodigious numbers; that the lodgings of the counsel were near to the town-hall; &mdash; and that those little animals moved from place to place with wonderful agility. Johnson sat in great impatience till the gentleman had finished his tedious narrative, and then burst out (playfully however,) &lsquo;It is a pity, Sir, that you have not seen a lion; for a flea has taken you such a time, that a lion must have served you a twelve-month.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He would not allow Scotland to derive any credit from Lord Mansfield; for he was educated in England. &lsquo;Much (said he,) may be made of a Scotchman, if he be <span class="t8">caught</span> young.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p10">Talking of a modern historian and a modern moralist, he said, &lsquo;There is more thought in the moralist than in the historian. There is but a shallow stream of thought in history.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;But surely, Sir, an historian has reflection.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why yes, Sir; and so has a cat when she catches a mouse for her kitten. But she cannot write like * * * *; neither can * * * *.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p21">He said, &lsquo;I am very unwilling to read the manuscripts of authours, and give them my opinion. If the authours who apply to me have money, I bid them boldly print without a name; if they have written in order to get money, I tell them to go to the booksellers, and make the best bargain they can.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;But, Sir, if a bookseller should bring you a manuscript to look at?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, I would desire the bookseller to take it away.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I mentioned a friend of mine who had resided long in Spain, and was unwilling to return to Britain. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, he is attached to some woman.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;I rather believe, Sir, it is the fine climate which keeps him there.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Nay, Sir, how can you talk so? What is climate to happiness? Place me in the heart of Asia, should I not be exiled? What proportion does climate bear to the complex system of human life? You may advise me to go to live at Bologna to eat sausages. The sausages there are the best in the world; they lose much by being carried.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Saturday, May 9, Mr. Dempster and I had agreed to dine by ourselves at the British Coffee-house. Johnson, on whom I happened to call in the morning, said he would join us, which he did, and we spent a very agreeable day, though I recollect but little of what passed.</p>
<p class="p24">He said, &lsquo;Walpole was a minister given by the King to the people: Pitt was a minister given by the people to the King, &mdash; as an adjunct.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The misfortune of Goldsmith in conversation is this: he goes on without knowing how he is to get off. His genius is great, but his knowledge is small. As they say of a generous man, it is a pity he is not rich, we may say of Goldsmith, it is a pity he is not knowing. He would not keep his knowledge to himself.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Before leaving London this year, I consulted him upon a question purely of Scotch law. It was held of old, and continued for a long period, to be an established principle in that law, that whoever intermeddled with the effects of a person deceased, without the interposition of legal authority to guard against embezzlement, should be subjected to pay all the debts of the deceased, as having been guilty of what was technically called <span class="t8">vicious intromission</span>. The Court of Session had gradually relaxed the strictness of this principle, where the interference proved had been inconsiderable. In a case which came before that Court the preceding winter, I had laboured to persuade the Judges to return to the ancient law. It was my own sincere opinion, that they ought to adhere to it; but I had exhausted all my powers of reasoning in vain. Johnson thought as I did; and in order to assist me in my application to the Court for a revision and alteration of the judgement, he dictated to me the following argument: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;This, we are told, is a law which has its force only from the long practice of the Court: and may, therefore, be suspended or modified as the Court shall think proper.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Concerning the power of the Court to make or to suspend a law, we have no intention to inquire. It is sufficient for our purpose that every just law is dictated by reason; and that the practice of every legal Court is regulated by equity. It is the quality of reason to be invariable and constant; and of equity, to give to one man what, in the same case, is given to another. The advantage which humanity derives from law is this: that the law gives every man a rule of action, and prescribes a mode of conduct which shall entitle him to the support and protection of society. That the law may be a rule of action, it is necessary that it be known; it is necessary that it be permanent and stable. The law is the measure of civil right; but if the measure be changeable, the extent of the thing measured never can be settled.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To permit a law to be modified at discretion, is to leave the community without law. It is to withdraw the direction of that publick wisdom, by which the deficiencies of private understanding are to be supplied. It is to suffer the rash and ignorant to act at discretion, and then to depend for the legality of that action on the sentence of the Judge. He that is thus governed, lives not by law, but by opinion: not by a certain rule to which he can apply his intention before he acts, but by an uncertain and variable opinion, which he can never know but after he has committed the act on which that opinion shall be passed. He lives by a law, (if a law it be,) which he can never know before he has offended it. To this case may be justly applied that important principle, <span class="t8">misera est servitus ubi jus est aut incognitum aut vagum</span>. If Intromission be not criminal till it exceeds a certain point, and that point be unsettled, and consequently different in different minds, the right of Intromission, and the right of the Creditor arising from it, are all <span class="t8">jura vaga</span>, and, by consequence, are <span class="t8">jura incognita</span>; and the result can be no other than a <span class="t8">misera servitus</span>, an uncertainty concerning the event of action, a servile dependence on private opinion.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;It may be urged, and with great plausibility, that there may be Intromission without fraud; which, however true, will by no means justify an occasional and arbitrary relaxation of the law. The end of law is protection as well as vengeance. Indeed, vengeance is never used but to strengthen protection. That society only is well governed, where life is freed from danger and from suspicion; where possession is so sheltered by salutary prohibitions, that violation is prevented more frequently than punished. Such a prohibition was this, while it operated with its original force. The creditor of the deceased was not only without loss, but without fear. He was not to seek a remedy for an injury suffered; for, injury was warded off.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;As the law has been sometimes administered, it lays us open to wounds, because it is imagined to have the power of healing. To punish fraud when it is detected, is the proper act of vindictive justice; but to prevent frauds, and make punishment unnecessary, is the great employment of legislative wisdom. To permit Intromission, and to punish fraud, is to make law no better than a pitfall. To tread upon the brink is safe; but to come a step further is destruction. But, surely, it is better to enclose the gulf, and hinder all access, than by encouraging us to advance a little, to entice us afterwards a little further, and let us perceive our folly only by our destruction.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;As law supplies the weak with adventitious strength, it likewise enlightens the ignorant with extrinsick understanding. Law teaches us to know when we commit injury, and when we suffer it. It fixes certain marks upon actions, by which we are admonished to do or to forbear them. <span class="t8">Qui sibi bene temperat in licitis</span>, says one of the fathers, <span class="t8">nunquam cadet in illicita</span>. He who never intromits at all, will never intromit with fraudulent intentions.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The relaxation of the law against vicious intromission has been very favourably represented by a great master of jurisprudence, whose words have been exhibited with unnecessary pomp, and seem to be considered as irresistibly decisive. The great moment of his authority makes it necessary to examine his position. &ldquo;Some ages ago, (says he,) before the ferocity of the inhabitants of this part of the island was subdued, the utmost severity of the civil law was necessary, to restrain individuals from plundering each other. Thus, the man who intermeddled irregularly with the moveables of a person deceased, was subjected to all the debts of the deceased without limitation. This makes a branch of the law of Scotland, known by the name of <span class="t8">vicious intromission</span>; and so rigidly was this regulation applied in our Courts of Law, that the most trifling moveable abstracted <span class="t8">mala fide</span>, subjected the intermeddler to the foregoing consequences, which proved in many instances a most rigorous punishment. But this severity was necessary, in order to subdue the undisciplined nature of our people. It is extremely remarkable, that in proportion to our improvement in manners, this regulation has been gradually softened, and applied by our sovereign Court with a sparing hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I find myself under a necessity of observing, that this learned and judicious writer has not accurately distinguished the deficiencies and demands of the different conditions of human life, which, from a degree of savageness and independence, in which all laws are vain, passes or may pass, by innumerable gradations, to a state of reciprocal benignity, in which laws shall be no longer necessary. Men are first wild and unsocial, living each man to himself, taking from the weak, and losing to the strong. In their first coalitions of society, much of this original savageness is retained. Of general happiness, the product of general confidence, there is yet no thought. Men continue to prosecute their own advantages by the nearest way; and the utmost severity of the civil law is necessary to restrain individuals from plundering each other. The restraints then necessary, are restraints from plunder, from acts of publick violence, and undisguised oppression. The ferocity of our ancestors, as of all other nations, produced not fraud, but rapine. They had not yet learned to cheat, and attempted only to rob. As manners grow more polished, with the knowledge of good, men attain likewise dexterity in evil. Open rapine becomes less frequent, and violence gives way to cunning. Those who before invaded pastures and stormed houses, now begin to enrich themselves by unequal contracts and fraudulent intromissions. It is not against the violence of ferocity, but the circumventions of deceit, that this law was framed; and I am afraid the increase of commerce, and the incessant struggle for riches which commerce excites, give us no prospect of an end speedily to be expected of artifice and fraud. It therefore seems to be no very conclusive reasoning, which connects those two propositions;&mdash; &ldquo;the nation is become less ferocious, and therefore the laws against fraud and <span class="t8">covin</span> shall be relaxed.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Whatever reason may have influenced the Judges to a relaxation of the law, it was not that the nation was grown less fierce; and, I am afraid, it cannot be affirmed, that it is grown less fraudulent.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Since this law has been represented as rigorously and unreasonably penal, it seems not improper to consider what are the conditions and qualities that make the justice or propriety of a penal law.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To make a penal law reasonable and just, two conditions are necessary, and two proper. It is necessary that the law should be adequate to its end; that, if it be observed, it shall prevent the evil against which it is directed. It is, secondly, necessary that the end of the law be of such importance, as to deserve the security of a penal sanction. The other conditions of a penal law, which though not absolutely necessary, are to a very high degree fit, are, that to the moral violation of the law there are many temptations, and that of the physical observance there is great facility.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;All these conditions apparently concur to justify the law which we are now considering. Its end is the security of property; and property very often of great value. The method by which it effects the security is efficacious, because it admits, in its original rigour, no gradations of injury; but keeps guilt and innocence apart, by a distinct and definite limitation. He that intromits, is criminal; he that intromits not, is innocent. Of the two secondary considerations it cannot be denied that both are in our favour. The temptation to intromit is frequent and strong; so strong and so frequent, as to require the utmost activity of justice, and vigilance of caution, to withstand its prevalence; and the method by which a man may entitle himself to legal intromission, is so open and so facile, that to neglect it is a proof of fraudulent intention: for why should a man omit to do (but for reasons which he will not confess,) that which he can do so easily, and that which he knows to be required by the law? If temptation were rare, a penal law might be deemed unnecessary. If the duty enjoined by the law were of difficult performance, omission, though it could not be justified, might be pitied. But in the present case, neither equity nor compassion operate against it. A useful, a necessary law is broken, not only without a reasonable motive, but with all the inducements to obedience that can be derived from safety and facility.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I therefore return to my original position, that a law, to have its effect, must be permanent and stable. It may be said, in the language of the schools, <span class="t8">Lex non recipit majus et minus</span>, &mdash; we may have a law, or we may have no law, but we cannot have half a law. We must either have a rule of action, or be permitted to act by discretion and by chance. Deviations from the law must be uniformly punished, or no man can be certain when he shall be safe.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;That from the rigour of the original institution this Court has sometimes departed, cannot be denied. But, as it is evident that such deviations, as they make law uncertain, make life unsafe, I hope, that of departing from it there will now be an end; that the wisdom of our ancestors will be treated with due reverence; and that consistent and steady decisions will furnish the people with a rule of action, and leave fraud and fraudulent intromission no future hope of impunity or escape.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">With such comprehension of mind, and such clearness of penetration, did he thus treat a subject altogether new to him, without any other preparation than my having stated to him the arguments which had been used on each side of the question. His intellectual powers appeared with peculiar lustre, when tried against those of a writer of so much fame as Lord Kames, and that too in his Lordship&rsquo;s own department.</p>
<p class="p24">This masterly argument, after being prefaced and concluded with some sentences of my own, and garnished with the usual formularies, was actually printed and laid before the Lords of Session, but without success. My respected friend Lord Hailes, however, one of that honourable body, had critical sagacity enough to discover a more than ordinary hand in the <span class="t8">Petition</span>. I told him Dr. Johnson had favoured me with his pen. His Lordship, with wonderful <span class="t8">acumen</span>, pointed out exactly where his composition began, and where it ended. But that I may do impartial justice, and conform to the great rule of Courts, <span class="t8">Suum cuique tribuito</span>, I must add, that their Lordships in general, though they were pleased to call this &lsquo;a well-drawn paper,&rsquo; preferred the former very inferiour petition which I had written; thus confirming the truth of an observation made to me by one of their number, in a merry mood: &lsquo;My dear Sir, give yourself no trouble in the composition of the papers you present to us; for, indeed, it is casting pearls before swine.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I renewed my solicitations that Dr. Johnson would this year accomplish his long-intended visit to Scotland.</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;TO JAMES BOSWELL, ESQ.</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The regret has not been little with which I have missed a journey so pregnant with pleasing expectations, as that in which I could promise myself not only the gratification of curiosity, both rational and fanciful, but the delight of seeing those whom I love and esteem. But such has been the course of things, that I could not come; and such has been, I am afraid, the state of my body, that it would not well have seconded my inclination. My body, I think, grows better, and I refer my hopes to another year; for I am very sincere in my design to pay the visit, and take the ramble. In the mean time, do not omit any opportunity of keeping up a favourable opinion of me in the minds of any of my friends. Beattie&rsquo;s book is, I believe, every day more liked; at least, I like it more, as I look more upon it.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am glad if you got credit by your cause, and am yet of opinion, that our cause was good, and that the determination ought to have been in your favour. Poor Hastie, I think, had but his deserts.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;You promised to get me a little <span class="t8">Pindar</span>, you may add to it a little <span class="t8">Anacreon</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The leisure which I cannot enjoy, it will be a pleasure to hear that you employ upon the antiquities of the feudal establishment. The whole system of ancient tenures is gradually passing away; and I wish to have the knowledge of it preserved adequate and complete. For such an institution makes a very important part of the history of mankind. Do not forget a design so worthy of a scholar who studies the laws of his country, and of a gentleman who may naturally be curious to know the condition of his own ancestors.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am, dear Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Yours with great affection,</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SAM JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;August 31, 1772.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;TO DR. JOHNSON.</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;MY DEAR SIR,</p>

<p class="p10">* * * * *</p>
<p class="p21">&lsquo;I was much disappointed that you did not come to Scotland last autumn. However, I must own that your letter prevents me from complaining; not only because I am sensible that the state of your health was but too good an excuse, but because you write in a strain which shews that you have agreeable views of the scheme which we have so long proposed.</p>
<p class="p10">* * * * *</p>
<p class="p21">&lsquo;I communicated to Beattie what you said of his book in your last letter to me. He writes to me thus:&mdash; &ldquo;You judge very rightly in supposing that Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s favourable opinion of any book must give me great delight. Indeed it is impossible for me to say how much I am gratified by it; for there is not a man upon earth whose good opinion I would be more ambitious to cultivate. His talents and his virtues I reverence more than any words can express. The extraordinary civilities (the paternal attentions I should rather say,) and the many instructions I have had the honour to receive from him, will to me be a perpetual source of pleasure in the recollection,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;&ldquo;<span class="t8">Dum memor ipse mei, dum spiritus has reget artus</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;&ldquo;I had still some thoughts, while the summer lasted, of being obliged to go to London on some little business; otherwise I should certainly have troubled him with a letter several months ago, and given some vent to my gratitude and admiration. This I intend to do, as soon as I am left a little at leisure. Mean time, if you have occasion to write to him, I beg you will offer him my most respectful compliments, and assure him of the sincerity of my attachment and the warmth of my gratitude.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="p24">1773: AETAT. 64. &mdash; In 1773 his only publication was an edition of his folio <span class="t8">Dictionary</span>, with additions and corrections; nor did he, so far as is known, furnish any productions of his fertile pen to any of his numerous friends or dependants, except the Preface to his old amanuensis Macbean&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Dictionary of Ancient Geography</span>. His <span class="t8">Shakspeare</span>, indeed, which had been received with high approbation by the publick, and gone through several editions, was this year re-published by George Steevens, Esq., a gentleman not only deeply skilled in ancient learning, and of very extensive reading in English literature, especially the early writers, but at the same time of acute discernment and elegant taste. It is almost unnecessary to say, that by his great and valuable additions to Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s work, he justly obtained considerable reputation:</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;<span class="t8">Divisum imperium cum Jove Caesar habet</span>.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To JAMES BOSWELL, ESQ.</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I have read your kind letter much more than the elegant <span class="t8">Pindar</span> which it accompanied. I am always glad to find myself not forgotten; and to be forgotten by you would give me great uneasiness. My northern friends have never been unkind to me: I have from you, dear Sir, testimonies of affection, which I have not often been able to excite; and Dr. Beattie rates the testimony which I was desirous of paying to his merit, much higher than I should have thought it reasonable to expect.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I have heard of your masquerade. What says your synod to such innovations? I am not studiously scrupulous, nor do I think a masquerade either evil in itself, or very likely to be the occasion of evil; yet as the world thinks it a very licentious relaxation of manners, I would not have been one of the <span class="t8">first</span> masquers in a country where no masquerade had ever been before.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;A new edition of my great <span class="t8">Dictionary</span> is printed, from a copy which I was persuaded to revise; but having made no preparation, I was able to do very little. Some superfluities I have expunged, and some faults I have corrected, and here and there have scattered a remark; but the main fabrick of the work remains as it was. I had looked very little into it since I wrote it, and, I think, I found it full as often better, as worse, than I expected.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Baretti and Davies have had a furious quarrel; a quarrel, I think, irreconcileable. Dr. Goldsmith has a new comedy, which is expected in the spring. No name is yet given it. The chief diversion arises from a stratagem by which a lover is made to mistake his future father-in-law&rsquo;s house for an inn. This, you see, borders upon farce. The dialogue is quick and gay, and the incidents are so prepared as not to seem improbable.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am sorry that you lost your cause of Intromission, because I yet think the arguments on your side unanswerable. But you seem, I think, to say that you gained reputation even by your defeat; and reputation you will daily gain, if you keep Lord Auchinleck&rsquo;s precept in your mind, and endeavour to consolidate in your mind a firm and regular system of law, instead of picking up occasional fragments.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;My health seems in general to improve; but I have been troubled for many weeks with a vexatious catarrh, which is sometimes sufficiently distressful. I have not found any great effects from bleeding and physick; and am afraid, that I must expect help from brighter days and softer air.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Write to me now and then; and whenever any good befalls you, make haste to let me know it, for no one will rejoice at it more than, dear Sir,</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;Your most humble servant,<br/>&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;<br/>&lsquo;London, Feb. 24, 1773.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;You continue to stand very high in the favour of Mrs. Thrale.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">While a former edition of my work was passing through the press, I was unexpectedly favoured with a packet from Philadelphia, from Mr. James Abercrombie, a gentleman of that country, who is pleased to honour me with very high praise of my <span class="t8">Life of Dr. Johnson</span>. To have the fame of my illustrious friend, and his faithful biographer, echoed from the New World is extremely flattering; and my grateful acknowledgements shall be wafted across the Atlantick. Mr. Abercrombie has politely conferred on me a considerable additional obligation, by transmitting to me copies of two letters from Dr. Johnson to American gentlemen. &lsquo;Gladly, Sir, (says he,) would I have sent you the originals; but being the only relicks of the kind in America, they are considered by the possessors of such inestimable value, that no possible consideration would induce them to part with them. In some future publication of yours relative to that great and good man, they may perhaps be thought worthy of insertion.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To MR. B &mdash; D.</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;That in the hurry of a sudden departure you should yet find leisure to consult my convenience, is a degree of kindness, and an instance of regard, not only beyond my claims, but above my expectation. You are not mistaken in supposing that I set a high value on my American friends, and that you should confer a very valuable favour upon me by giving me an opportunity of keeping myself in their memory.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I have taken the liberty of troubling you with a packet, to which I wish a safe and speedy conveyance, because I wish a safe and speedy voyage to him that conveys it. I am, Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your most humble servant,</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;London, Johnson&rsquo;s-court,<br/>Fleet street, March 4, 1773.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To THE REVEREND MR. WHITE.</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your kindness for your friends accompanies you across the Atlantick. It was long since observed by Horace, that no ship could leave care behind; you have been attended in your voyage by other powers, &mdash; by benevolence and constancy; and I hope care did not often shew her face in their company.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I received the copy of <span class="t8">Rasselas</span>. The impression is not magnificent, but it flatters an authour, because the printer seems to have expected that it would be scattered among the people. The little book has been well received, and is translated into Italian, French, German, and Dutch. It has now one honour more by an American edition.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I know not that much has happened since your departure that can engage your curiosity. Of all publick transactions the whole world is now informed by the newspapers. Opposition seems to despond; and the dissenters, though they have taken advantage of unsettled times, and a government much enfeebled, seem not likely to gain any immunities.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Dr. Goldsmith has a new comedy in rehearsal at Covent-Garden, to which the manager predicts ill success. I hope he will be mistaken. I think it deserves a very kind reception.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I shall soon publish a new edition of my large <span class="t8">Dictionary</span>; I have been persuaded to revise it, and have mended some faults, but added little to its usefulness.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;No book has been published since your departure, of which much notice is taken. Faction only fills the town with pamphlets, and greater subjects are forgotten in the noise of discord.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Thus have I written, only to tell you how little I have to tell. Of myself I can only add, that having been afflicted many weeks with a very troublesome cough, I am now recovered.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I take the liberty which you give me of troubling you with a letter, of which you will please to fill up the direction. I am, Sir,</p>
<p class="p26">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rsquo;Your most humble servant,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rsquo;SAM JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p26">&nbsp;&rsquo;Johnson&rsquo;s-court, Fleet-street,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;London, March 4, 1773.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Saturday, April 3, the day after my arrival in London this year, I went to his house late in the evening, and sat with Mrs. Williams till he came home. I found in the <span class="t8">London Chronicle</span>, Dr. Goldsmith&rsquo;s apology to the publick for beating Evans, a bookseller, on account of a paragraph in a newspaper published by him, which Goldsmith thought impertinent to him and to a lady of his acquaintance. The apology was written so much in Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s manner, that both Mrs. Williams and I supposed it to be his; but when he came home, he soon undeceived us. When he said to Mrs. Williams, &lsquo;Well, Dr. Goldsmith&rsquo;s <span class="t8">manifesto</span> has got into your paper;&rsquo; I asked him if Dr. Goldsmith had written it, with an air that made him see I suspected it was his, though subscribed by Goldsmith. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, Dr. Goldsmith would no more have asked me to write such a thing as that for him, than he would have asked me to feed him with a spoon, or to do anything else that denoted his imbecility. I as much believe that he wrote it, as if I had seen him do it. Sir, had he shewn it to any one friend, he would not have been allowed to publish it. He has, indeed, done it very well; but it is a foolish thing well done. I suppose he has been so much elated with the success of his new comedy, that he has thought every thing that concerned him must be of importance to the publick.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;I fancy, Sir, this is the first time that he has been engaged in such an adventure.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, I believe it is the first time he has <span class="t8">beat</span>; he may have <span class="t8">been beaten</span> before. This, Sir, is a new plume to him.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I mentioned Sir John Dalrymple&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Memoirs of Great-Britain and Ireland</span>, and his discoveries to the prejudice of Lord Russel and Algernon Sydney. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, every body who had just notions of government thought them rascals before. It is well that all mankind now see them to be rascals.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;But, Sir, may not those discoveries be true without their being rascals?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Consider, Sir; would any of them have been willing to have had it known that they intrigued with France? Depend upon it, Sir, he who does what he is afraid should be known, has something rotten about him. This Dalrymple seems to be an honest fellow; for he tells equally what makes against both sides. But nothing can be poorer than his mode of writing, it is the mere bouncing of a school-boy. Great He! but greater She! and such stuff.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I could not agree with him in this criticism; for though Sir John Dalrymple&rsquo;s style is not regularly formed in any respect, and one cannot help smiling sometimes at his affected <span class="t8">grandiloquence</span>, there is in his writing a pointed vivacity, and much of a gentlemanly spirit.</p>
<p class="p24">At Mr. Thrale&rsquo;s, in the evening, he repeated his usual paradoxical declamation against action in publick speaking. &lsquo;Action can have no effect upon reasonable minds. It may augment noise, but it never can enforce argument. If you speak to a dog, you use action; you hold up your hand thus, because he is a brute; and in proportion as men are removed from brutes, action will have the less influence upon them.&rsquo; MRS. THRALE. &lsquo;What then, Sir, becomes of Demosthenes&rsquo;s saying? &ldquo;Action, action, action!&rdquo;&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Demosthenes, Madam, spoke to an assembly of brutes; to a barbarous people.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I thought it extraordinary, that he should deny the power of rhetorical action upon human nature, when it is proved by innumerable facts in all stages of society. Reasonable beings are not solely reasonable. They have fancies which may be pleased, passions which may be roused.</p>
<p class="p24">Lord Chesterfield being mentioned, Johnson remarked, that almost all of that celebrated nobleman&rsquo;s witty sayings were puns. He, however, allowed the merit of good wit to his Lordship&rsquo;s saying of Lord Tyrawley and himself, when both very old and infirm: &lsquo;Tyrawley and I have been dead these two years; but we don&rsquo;t choose to have it known.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He talked with approbation of an intended edition of <span class="t8">The</span> Spectator, with notes; two volumes of which had been prepared by a gentleman eminent in the literary world, and the materials which he had collected for the remainder had been transferred to another hand. He observed, that all works which describe manners, require notes in sixty or seventy years, or less; and told us, he had communicated all he knew that could throw light upon <span class="t8">The Spectator</span>. He said, &lsquo;Addison had made his Sir Andrew Freeport a true Whig, arguing against giving charity to beggars, and throwing out other such ungracious sentiments; but that he had thought better, and made amends by making him found an hospital for decayed farmers.&rsquo; He called for the volume of <span class="t8">The Spectator</span>, in which that account is contained, and read it aloud to us. He read so well, that every thing acquired additional weight and grace from his utterance.</p>
<p class="p24">The conversation having turned on modern imitations of ancient ballads, and some one having praised their simplicity, he treated them with that ridicule which he always displayed when that subject was mentioned.</p>
<p class="p24">He disapproved of introducing scripture phrases into secular discourse. This seemed to me a question of some difficulty. A scripture expression may be used, like a highly classical phrase, to produce an instantaneous strong impression; and it may be done without being at all improper. Yet I own there is danger, that applying the language of our sacred book to ordinary subjects may tend to lessen our reverence for it. If therefore it be introduced at all, it should be with very great caution.</p>
<p class="p24">On Thursday, April 8, I sat a good part of the evening with him, but he was very silent. He said, &lsquo;Burnet&rsquo;s <span class="t8">History of his own times</span> is very entertaining. The style, indeed, is mere chitchat. I do not believe that Burnet intentionally lyed; but he was so much prejudiced, that he took no pains to find out the truth. He was like a man who resolves to regulate his time by a certain watch; but will not inquire whether the watch is right or not.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Though he was not disposed to talk, he was unwilling that I should leave him; and when I looked at my watch, and told him it was twelve o&rsquo;clock, he cried, &lsquo;What&rsquo;s that to you and me?&rsquo; and ordered Frank to tell Mrs. Williams that we were coming to drink tea with her, which we did. It was settled that we should go to church together next day.</p>
<p class="p24">On the 9th of April, being Good Friday, I breakfasted with him on tea and cross-buns; <span class="t8">Doctor</span> Levet, as Frank called him, making the tea. He carried me with him to the church of St. Clement Danes, where he had his seat; and his behaviour was, as I had imaged to myself, solemnly devout. I never shall forget the tremulous earnestness with which he pronounced the awful petition in the Litany: &lsquo;In the hour of death, and at the day of judgement, good LORD deliver us.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">We went to church both in the morning and evening. In the interval between the two services we did not dine; but he read in the Greek New Testament, and I turned over several of his books.</p>
<p class="p24">In Archbishop Laud&rsquo;s Diary, I found the following passage, which I read to Dr. Johnson: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;1623. February 1, Sunday. I stood by the most illustrious Prince Charles, at dinner. He was then very merry, and talked occasionally of many things with his attendants. Among other things, he said, that if he were necessitated to take any particular profession of life, he could not be a lawyer, adding his reasons: &ldquo;I cannot (saith he,) defend a bad, nor yield in a good cause.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, this is false reasoning; because every cause has a bad side; and a lawyer is not overcome, though the cause which he has endeavoured to support be determined against him.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I told him that Goldsmith had said to me a few days before, &lsquo;As I take my shoes from the shoemaker, and my coat from the taylor, so I take my religion from the priest.&rsquo; I regretted this loose way of talking. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, he knows nothing; he has made up his mind about nothing.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">To my great surprize he asked me to dine with him on Easter-day. I never supposed that he had a dinner at his house; for I had not then heard of any one of his friends having been entertained at his table. He told me, &lsquo;I generally have a meat pye on Sunday: it is baked at a publick oven, which is very properly allowed, because one man can attend it; and thus the advantage is obtained of not keeping servants from church to dress dinners.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">April 11, being Easter-Sunday, after having attended Divine Service at St. Paul&rsquo;s, I repaired to Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s. I had gratified my curiosity much in dining with JEAN JAQUES ROUSSEAU, while he lived in the wilds of Neufchatel: I had as great a curiosity to dine with DR. SAMUEL JOHNSON, in the dusky recess of a court in Fleet-street. I supposed we should scarcely have knives and forks, and only some strange, uncouth, ill-drest dish: but I found every thing in very good order. We had no other company but Mrs. Williams and a young woman whom I did not know. As a dinner here was considered as a singular phenomenon, and as I was frequently interrogated on the subject, my readers may perhaps be desirous to know our bill of fare. Foote, I remember, in allusion to Francis, the <span class="t8">negro</span>, was willing to suppose that our repast was <span class="t8">black broth</span>. But the fact was, that we had a very good soup, a boiled leg of lamb and spinach, a veal pye, and a rice pudding.</p>
<p class="p24">Of Dr. John Campbell, the authour, he said, &lsquo;He is a very inquisitive and a very able man, and a man of good religious principles, though I am afraid he has been deficient in practice. Campbell is radically right; and we may hope, that in time there will be good practice.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He owned that he thought Hawkesworth was one of his imitators, but he did not think Goldsmith was. Goldsmith, he said, had great merit. BOSWELL. &lsquo;But, Sir, he is much indebted to you for his getting so high in the publick estimation.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, he has perhaps got <span class="t8">sooner</span> to it by his intimacy with me.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Goldsmith, though his vanity often excited him to occasional competition, had a very high regard for Johnson, which he at this time expressed in the strongest manner in the Dedication of his comedy, entitled, <span class="t8">She Stoops to Conquer</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson observed, that there were very few books printed in Scotland before the Union. He had seen a complete collection of them in the possession of the Hon. Archibald Campbell, a non-juring Bishop. I wish this collection had been kept entire. Many of them are in the library of the Faculty of Advocates at Edinburgh. I told Dr. Johnson that I had some intention to write the life of the learned and worthy Thomas Ruddiman. He said, &lsquo;I should take pleasure in helping you to do honour to him. But his farewell letter to the Faculty of Advocates, when he resigned the office of their Librarian, should have been in Latin.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I put a question to him upon a fact in common life, which he could not answer, nor have I found any one else who could. What is the reason that women servants, though obliged to be at the expense of purchasing their own clothes, have much lower wages than men servants, to whom a great proportion of that article is furnished, and when in fact our female house servants work much harder than the male?</p>
<p class="p24">He told me that he had twelve or fourteen times attempted to keep a journal of his life, but never could persevere. He advised me to do it. &lsquo;The great thing to be recorded, (said he), is the state of your own mind; and you should write down every thing that you remember, for you cannot judge at first what is good or bad; and write immediately while the impression is fresh, for it will not be the same a week afterwards.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I again solicited him to communicate to me the particulars of his early life. He said, &lsquo;You shall have them all for twopence. I hope you shall know a great deal more of me before you write my Life.&rsquo; He mentioned to me this day many circumstances, which I wrote down when I went home, and have interwoven in the former part of this narrative.</p>
<p class="p24">On Tuesday, April 13, he and Dr. Goldsmith and I dined at General Oglethorpe&rsquo;s. Goldsmith expatiated on the common topick, that the race of our people was degenerated, and that this was owing to luxury. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, in the first place, I doubt the fact. I believe there are as many tall men in England now, as ever there were. But, secondly, supposing the stature of our people to be diminished, that is not owing to luxury; for, Sir, consider to how very small a proportion of our people luxury can reach. Our soldiery, surely, are not luxurious, who live on six-pence a day; and the same remark will apply to almost all the other classes. Luxury, so far as it reaches the poor, will do good to the race of people; it will strengthen and multiply them. Sir, no nation was ever hurt by luxury; for, as I said before, it can reach but to a very few. I admit that the great increase of commerce and manufactures hurts the military spirit of a people; because it produces a competition for something else than martial honours, &mdash; a competition for riches. It also hurts the bodies of the people; for you will observe, there is no man who works at any particular trade, but you may know him from his appearance to do so. One part or other of his body being more used than the rest, he is in some degree deformed: but, Sir, that is not luxury. A tailor sits cross-legged; but that is not luxury.&rsquo; GOLDSMITH. &lsquo;Come, you&rsquo;re just going to the same place by another road.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Nay, Sir, I say that is not <span class="t8">luxury</span>. Let us take a walk from Charing-cross to White-chapel, through, I suppose, the greatest series of shops in the world; what is there in any of these shops (if you except gin-shops,) that can do any human being any harm?&rsquo; GOLDSMITH. &lsquo;Well, Sir, I&rsquo;ll accept your challenge. The very next shop to Northumberland-house is a pickle-shop.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Well, Sir: do we not know that a maid can in one afternoon make pickles sufficient to serve a whole family for a year? nay, that five pickle-shops can serve all the kingdom? Besides, Sir, there is no harm done to any body by the making of pickles, or the eating of pickles.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">We drank tea with the ladies; and Goldsmith sung Tony Lumpkin&rsquo;s song in his comedy, <span class="t8">She Stoops to Conquer</span>, and a very pretty one, to an Irish tune, which he had designed for Miss Hardcastle; but as Mrs. Bulkeley, who played the part, could not sing, it was left out. He afterwards wrote it down for me, by which means it was preserved, and now appears amongst his poems. Dr. Johnson, in his way home, stopped at my lodgings in Piccadilly, and sat with me, drinking tea a second time, till a late hour.</p>
<p class="p24">I told him that Mrs. Macaulay said, she wondered how he could reconcile his political principles with his moral; his notions of inequality and subordination with wishing well to the happiness of all mankind, who might live so agreeably, had they all their portions of land, and none to domineer over another. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, I reconcile my principles very well, because mankind are happier in a state of inequality and subordination. Were they to be in this pretty state of equality, they would soon degenerate into brutes; &mdash; they would become Monboddo&rsquo;s nation; &mdash; their tails would grow. Sir, all would be losers were all to work for all: &mdash; they would have no intellectual improvement. All intellectual improvement arises from leisure; all leisure arises from one working for another.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Talking of the family of Stuart, he said, &lsquo;It should seem that the family at present on the throne has now established as good a right as the former family, by the long consent of the people; and that to disturb this right might be considered as culpable. At the same time I own, that it is a very difficult question, when considered with respect to the house of Stuart. To oblige people to take oaths as to the disputed right, is wrong. I know not whether I could take them: but I do not blame those who do.&rsquo; So conscientious and so delicate was he upon this subject, which has occasioned so much clamour against him.</p>
<p class="p24">Talking of law cases, he said, &lsquo;The English reports, in general, are very poor: only the half of what has been said is taken down; and of that half, much is mistaken. Whereas, in Scotland, the arguments on each side are deliberately put in writing, to be considered by the Court. I think a collection of your cases upon subjects of importance, with the opinions of the Judges upon them, would be valuable.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Thursday, April 15, I dined with him and Dr. Goldsmith at General Paoli&rsquo;s. We found here Signor Martinelli, of Florence, authour of a <span class="t8">History of England</span>, in Italian, printed at London.</p>
<p class="p24">I spoke of Allan Ramsay&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Gentle Shepherd</span>, in the Scottish dialect, as the best pastoral that had ever been written; not only abounding with beautiful rural imagery, and just and pleasing sentiments, but being a real picture of manners; and I offered to teach Dr. Johnson to understand it. &lsquo;No, Sir (said he,) I won&rsquo;t learn it. You shall retain your superiority by my not knowing it.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">This brought on a question whether one man is lessened by another&rsquo;s acquiring an equal degree of knowledge with him. Johnson asserted the affirmative. I maintained that the position might be true in those kinds of knowledge which produce wisdom, power, and force, so as to enable one man to have the government of others; but that a man is not in any degree lessened by others knowing as well as he what ends in mere pleasure: &mdash; eating fine fruits, drinking delicious wines, reading exquisite poetry.</p>
<p class="p24">The General observed, that Martinelli was a Whig. JOHNSON. &lsquo;I am sorry for it. It shows the spirit of the times: he is obliged to temporise.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;I rather think, Sir, that Toryism prevails in this reign.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;I know not why you should think so, Sir. You see your friend Lord Lyttelton, a nobleman, is obliged in his <span class="t8">History</span> to write the most vulgar Whiggism.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">An animated debate took place whether Martinelli should continue his <span class="t8">History of England</span> to the present day. GOLDSMITH. &lsquo;To be sure he should.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;No, Sir; he would give great offence. He would have to tell of almost all the living great what they do not wish told.&rsquo; GOLDSMITH. &lsquo;It may, perhaps, be necessary for a native to be more cautious; but a foreigner who comes among us without prejudice, may be considered as holding the place of a Judge, and may speak his mind freely.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, a foreigner, when he sends a work from the press, ought to be on his guard against catching the errour and mistaken enthusiasm of the people among whom he happens to be.&rsquo; GOLDSMITH. &lsquo;Sir, he wants only to sell his history, and to tell truth; one an honest, the other a laudable motive.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, they are both laudable motives. It is laudable in a man to wish to live by his labours; but he should write so as he may <span class="t8">live</span> by them, not so as he may be knocked on the head. I would advise him to be at Calais before he publishes his history of the present age. A foreigner who attaches himself to a political party in this country, is in the worst state that can be imagined: he is looked upon as a mere intermeddler. A native may do it from interest.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Or principle.&rsquo; GOLDSMITH. &lsquo;There are people who tell a hundred political lies every day, and are not hurt by it. Surely, then, one may tell truth with safety.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, in the first place, he who tells a hundred lies has disarmed the force of his lies. But besides; a man had rather have a hundred lies told of him, than one truth which he does not wish should be told.&rsquo; GOLDSMITH. &lsquo;For my part, I&rsquo;d tell truth, and shame the devil.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Yes, Sir; but the devil will be angry. I wish to shame the devil as much you do, but I should choose to be out of the reach of his claws.&rsquo; GOLDSMITH. &lsquo;His claws can do you no harm, when you have the shield of truth.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p26">It having been observed that there was little hospitality in<br/>London; &mdash; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Nay, Sir, any man who has a name, or who has the<br/>power of pleasing, will be very generally invited in London. The man,<br/>Sterne, I have been told, has had engagements for three months.&rsquo;<br/>GOLDSMITH. &lsquo;And a very dull fellow.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, no, Sir.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Martinelli told us, that for several years he lived much with Charles Townshend, and that he ventured to tell him he was a bad joker. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, thus much I can say upon the subject. One day he and a few more agreed to go and dine in the country, and each of them was to bring a friend in his carriage with him. Charles Townshend asked Fitzherbert to go with him, but told him, &lsquo;You must find somebody to bring you back: I can only carry you there.&rsquo; Fitzherbert did not much like this arrangement. He however consented, observing sarcastically, &lsquo;It will do very well; for then the same jokes will serve you in returning as in going.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">An eminent publick character being mentioned; &mdash; JOHNSON. &lsquo;I remember being present when he shewed himself to be so corrupted, or at least something so different from what I think right, as to maintain, that a member of parliament should go along with his party right or wrong. Now, Sir, this is so remote from native virtue, from scholastick virtue, that a good man must have undergone a great change before he can reconcile himself to such a doctrine. It is maintaining that you may lie to the publick; for you lie when you call that right which you think wrong, or the reverse. A friend of ours, who is too much an echo of that gentleman, observed, that a man who does not stick uniformly to a party, is only waiting to be bought. Why then, said I, he is only waiting to be what that gentleman is already.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">We talked of the King&rsquo;s coming to see Goldsmith&rsquo;s new play.&mdash; &lsquo;I wish he would,&rsquo; said Goldsmith; adding, however, with an affected indifference, &lsquo;Not that it would do me the least good.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Well then, Sir, let us say it would do <span class="t8">him</span> good, (laughing). No, Sir, this affectation will not pass; &mdash; it is mighty idle. In such a state as ours, who would not wish to please the Chief Magistrate?&rsquo; GOLDSMITH. &lsquo;I <span class="t8">do</span> wish to please him. I remember a line in Dryden, &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&ldquo;And every poet is the monarch&rsquo;s friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">It ought to be reversed.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Nay, there are finer lines in Dryden on this subject: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p26">&ldquo;For colleges on bounteous Kings depend,<br/>And never rebel was to arts a friend.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">General Paoli observed, that &lsquo;successful rebels might.&rsquo; MARTINELLI. &lsquo;Happy rebellions.&rsquo; GOLDSMITH. &lsquo;We have no such phrase.&rsquo; GENERAL PAOLI. &lsquo;But have you not the <span class="t8">thing</span>?&rsquo; GOLDSMITH. &lsquo;Yes; all our <span class="t8">happy</span> revolutions. They have hurt our constitution, and will hurt it, till we mend it by another HAPPY REVOLUTION.&rsquo; I never before discovered that my friend Goldsmith had so much of the old prejudice in him.</p>
<p class="p24">General Paoli, talking of Goldsmith&rsquo;s new play, said, &lsquo;Il a fait un compliment très gracieux à une certaine grande dame;&rsquo; meaning a Duchess of the first rank.</p>
<p class="p24">I expressed a doubt whether Goldsmith intended it, in order that I might hear the truth from himself. It, perhaps, was not quite fair to endeavour to bring him to a confession, as he might not wish to avow positively his taking part against the Court. He smiled and hesitated. The General at once relieved him, by this beautiful image: &lsquo;<span class="t8">Monsieur Goldsmith est comme la mer, qui jette des perles et beau-coup d&rsquo;autres belle choses, sans s&rsquo;en appercevoir</span>.&rsquo; GOLDSMITH. &lsquo;<span class="t8">Très bien dit et très elegamment</span>.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">A person was mentioned, who it was said could take down in short hand the speeches in parliament with perfect exactness. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, it is impossible. I remember one, Angel, who came to me to write for him a Preface or Dedication to a book upon short hand, and he professed to write as fast as a man could speak. In order to try him, I took down a book, and read while he wrote; and I favoured him, for I read more deliberately than usual. I had proceeded but a very little way, when he begged I would desist, for he could not follow me.&rsquo; Hearing now for the first time of this Preface or Dedication, I said, &lsquo;What an expense, Sir, do you put us to in buying books, to which you have written Prefaces or Dedications.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why I have dedicated to the Royal family all round; that is to say, to the last generation of the Royal family.&rsquo; GOLDSMITH. &lsquo;And perhaps, Sir, not one sentence of wit in a whole Dedication.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Perhaps not, Sir.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;What then is the reason for applying to a particular person to do that which any one may do as well?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, one man has greater readiness at doing it than another.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I spoke of Mr. Harris, of Salisbury, as being a very learned man, and in particular an eminent Grecian. JOHNSON. &lsquo;I am not sure of that. His friends give him out as such, but I know not who of his friends are able to judge of it.&rsquo; GOLDSMITH. &lsquo;He is what is much better: he is a worthy humane man.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Nay, Sir, that is not to the purpose of our argument: that will as much prove that he can play upon the fiddle as well as Giardini, as that he is an eminent Grecian.&rsquo; GOLDSMITH. &lsquo;The greatest musical performers have but small emoluments. Giardini, I am told, does not get above seven hundred a year.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;That is indeed but little for a man to get, who does best that which so many endeavour to do. There is nothing, I think, in which the power of art is shown so much as in playing on the fiddle. In all other things we can do something at first. Any man will forge a bar of iron, if you give him a hammer; not so well as a smith, but tolerably. A man will saw a piece of wood, and make a box, though a clumsy one; but give him a fiddle and a fiddle-stick, and he can do nothing.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Monday, April 19, he called on me with Mrs. Williams, in Mr. Strahan&rsquo;s coach, and carried me out to dine with Mr. Elphinston, at his academy at Kensington. A printer having acquired a fortune sufficient to keep his coach, was a good topick for the credit of literature. Mrs. Williams said, that another printer, Mr. Hamilton, had not waited so long as Mr. Strahan, but had kept his coach several years sooner. JOHNSON. &lsquo;He was in the right. Life is short. The sooner that a man begins to enjoy his wealth the better.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Mr. Elphinston talked of a new book that was much admired, and asked Dr. Johnson if he had read it. JOHNSON. &lsquo;I have looked into it.&rsquo; &lsquo;What (said Elphinston,) have you not read it through?&rsquo; Johnson, offended at being thus pressed, and so obliged to own his cursory mode of reading, answered tartly, &lsquo;No, Sir, do <span class="t8">you</span> read books <span class="t8">through</span>?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He this day again defended duelling, and put his argument upon what I have ever thought the most solid basis; that if publick war be allowed to be consistent with morality, private war must be equally so. Indeed we may observe what strained arguments are used, to reconcile war with the Christian religion. But, in my opinion, it is exceedingly clear that duelling, having better reasons for its barbarous violence, is more justifiable than war, in which thousands go forth without any cause of personal quarrel, and massacre each other.</p>
<p class="p24">On Wednesday, April 21, I dined with him at Mr. Thrale&rsquo;s. A gentleman attacked Garrick for being vain. JOHNSON. &lsquo;No wonder, Sir, that he is vain; a man who is perpetually flattered in every mode that can be conceived. So many bellows have blown the fire, that one wonders he is not by this time become a cinder.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;And such bellows too. Lord Mansfield with his cheeks like to burst: Lord Chatham like an Æolus. I have read such notes from them to him, as were enough to turn his head.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;True. When he whom every body else flatters, flatters me, I then am truely happy.&rsquo; MRS. THRALE. &lsquo;The sentiment is in Congreve, I think.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Yes, Madam, in <span class="t8">The Way of the World</span>:</p>
<p class="p26">&ldquo;If there&rsquo;s delight in love, &rsquo;tis when I see<br/>&nbsp;That heart which others bleed for, bleed for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;No, Sir, I should not be surprised though Garrick chained the ocean, and lashed the winds.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Should it not be, Sir, lashed the ocean and chained the winds?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;No, Sir, recollect the original:</p>
<p class="p24">&ldquo;In Corum atque Eurum solitus saevire flagellis Barbarus, Æolio nunquam hoc in carcere passos, Ipsum compedibus qui viscxerat Ennosigoeum.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;This does very well, when both the winds and the sea are personified, and mentioned by their mythological names, as in Juvenal; but when they are mentioned in plain language, the application of the epithets suggested by me, is the most obvious; and accordingly my friend himself, in his imitation of the passage which describes Xerxes, has</p>
<p class="p24">&ldquo;The waves he lashes, and enchains the wind.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">The modes of living in different countries, and the various views with which men travel in quest of new scenes, having been talked of, a learned gentleman who holds a considerable office in the law, expatiated on the happiness of a savage life; and mentioned an instance of an officer who had actually lived for some time in the wilds of America, of whom, when in that state, he quoted this reflection with an air of admiration, as if it had been deeply philosophical: &lsquo;Here am I, free and unrestrained, amidst the rude magnificence of Nature, with this Indian woman by my side, and this gun with which I can procure food when I want it: what more can be desired for human happiness?&rsquo; It did not require much sagacity to foresee that such a sentiment would not be permitted to pass without due animadversion. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Do not allow yourself, Sir, to be imposed upon by such gross absurdity. It is sad stuff; it is brutish. If a bull could speak, he might as well exclaim, &mdash; Here am I with this cow and this grass; what being can enjoy greater felicity?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">We talked of the melancholy end of a gentleman who had destroyed himself. JOHNSON. &lsquo;It was owing to imaginary difficulties in his affairs, which, had he talked with any friend, would soon have vanished.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Do you think, Sir, that all who commit suicide are mad?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, they are often not universally disordered in their intellects, but one passion presses so upon them, that they yield to it, and commit suicide, as a passionate man will stab another.&rsquo; He added, &lsquo;I have often thought, that after a man has taken the resolution to kill himself, it is not courage in him to do any thing, however desperate, because he has nothing to fear.&rsquo; GOLDSMITH. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t see that.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Nay, but my dear Sir, why should not you see what every one else sees?&rsquo; GOLDSMITH. &lsquo;It is for fear of something that he has resolved to kill himself; and will not that timid disposition restrain him?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;It does not signify that the fear of something made him resolve; it is upon the state of his mind, after the resolution is taken, that I argue. Suppose a man, either from fear, or pride, or conscience, or whatever motive, has resolved to kill himself; when once the resolution is taken, he has nothing to fear. He may then go and take the King of Prussia by the nose, at the head of his army. He cannot fear the rack, who is resolved to kill himself. When Eustace Budgel was walking down to the Thames, determined to drown himself, he might, if he pleased, without any apprehension of danger, have turned aside, and first set fire to St. James&rsquo;s palace.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Tuesday, April 27, Mr. Beauclerk and I called on him in the morning. As we walked up Johnson&rsquo;s-court, I said, &lsquo;I have a veneration for this court;&rsquo; and was glad to find that Beauclerk had the same reverential enthusiasm. We found him alone. We talked of Mr. Andrew Stuart&rsquo;s elegant and plausible Letters to Lord Mansfield: a copy of which had been sent by the authour to Dr. Johnson. JOHNSON. &lsquo;They have not answered the end. They have not been talked of; I have never heard of them. This is owing to their not being sold. People seldom read a book which is given to them; and few are given. The way to spread a work is to sell it at a low price. No man will send to buy a thing that costs even sixpence, without an intention to read it.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;May it not be doubted, Sir, whether it be proper to publish letters, arraigning the ultimate decision of an important cause by the supreme judicature of the nation?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;No, Sir, I do not think it was wrong to publish these letters. If they are thought to do harm, why not answer them? But they will do no harm; if Mr. Douglas be indeed the son of Lady Jane, he cannot be hurt: if he be not her son, and yet has the great estate of the family of Douglas, he may well submit to have a pamphlet against him by Andrew Stuart. Sir, I think such a publication does good, as it does good to show us the possibilities of human life. And Sir, you will not say that the Douglas cause was a cause of easy decision, when it divided your Court as much as it could do, to be determined at all. When your Judges were seven and seven, the casting vote of the President must be given on one side or other: no matter, for my argument, on which; one or the other <span class="t8">must</span> be taken: as when I am to move, there is no matter which leg I move first. And then, Sir, it was otherwise determined here. No, Sir, a more dubious determination of any question cannot be imagined.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He said, &lsquo;Goldsmith should not be for ever attempting to shine in conversation: he has not temper for it, he is so much mortified when he fails. Sir, a game of jokes is composed partly of skill, partly of chance, a man may be beat at times by one who has not the tenth part of his wit. Now Goldsmith&rsquo;s putting himself against another, is like a man laying a hundred to one who cannot spare the hundred. It is not worth a man&rsquo;s while. A man should not lay a hundred to one, unless he can easily spare it, though he has a hundred chances for him: he can get but a guinea, and he may lose a hundred. Goldsmith is in this state. When he contends, if he gets the better, it is a very little addition to a man of his literary reputation: if he does not get the better, he is miserably vexed.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson&rsquo;s own superlative powers of wit set him above any risk of such uneasiness. Garrick had remarked to me of him, a few days before, &lsquo;Rabelais and all other wits are nothing compared with him. You may be diverted by them; but Johnson gives you a forcible hug, and shakes laughter out of you, whether you will or no.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Goldsmith, however, was often very fortunate in his witty contests, even when he entered the lists with Johnson himself. Sir Joshua Reynolds was in company with them one day, when Goldsmith said, that he thought he could write a good fable, mentioned the simplicity which that kind of composition requires, and observed, that in most fables the animals introduced seldom talk in character. &lsquo;For instance, (said he,) the fable of the little fishes, who saw birds fly over their heads, and envying them, petitioned Jupiter to be changed into birds. The skill (continued he,) consists in making them talk like little fishes.&rsquo; While he indulged himself in this fanciful reverie, he observed Johnson shaking his sides, and laughing. Upon which he smartly proceeded, &lsquo;Why, Dr. Johnson, this is not so easy as you seem to think; for if you were to make little fishes talk, they would talk like WHALES.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson, though remarkable for his great variety of composition, never exercised his talents in fable, except we allow his beautiful tale published in Mrs. Williams&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Miscellanies</span> to be of that species. I have, however, found among his manuscript collections the following sketch of one:</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Glow-worm lying in the garden saw a candle in a neighbouring palace, &mdash; and complained of the littleness of his own light; &mdash; another observed &mdash; wait a little; &mdash; soon dark, &mdash; have outlasted [Greek: poll] [<span class="t8">many</span>] of these glaring lights which are only brighter as they haste to nothing.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Thursday, April 29, I dined with him at General Oglethorpe&rsquo;s, where were Sir Joshua Reynolds, Mr. Langton, Dr. Goldsmith, and Mr. Thrale. I was very desirous to get Dr. Johnson absolutely fixed in his resolution to go with me to the Hebrides this year; and I told him that I had received a letter from Dr. Robertson the historian, upon the subject, with which he was much pleased; and now talked in such a manner of his long-intended tour, that I was satisfied he meant to fulfil his engagement.</p>
<p class="p24">The custom of eating dogs at Otaheite being mentioned, Goldsmith observed, that this was also a custom in China; that a dog-butcher is as common there as any other butcher; and that when he walks abroad all the dogs fall on him. JOHNSON. &lsquo;That is not owing to his killing dogs, Sir. I remember a butcher at Lichfield, whom a dog that was in the house where I lived, always attacked. It is the smell of carnage which provokes this, let the animals he has killed be what they may.&rsquo; GOLDSMITH. &lsquo;Yes, there is a general abhorrence in animals at the signs of massacre. If you put a tub full of blood into a stable, the horses are like to go mad.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;I doubt that.&rsquo; GOLDSMITH. &lsquo;Nay, Sir, it is a fact well authenticated.&rsquo; THRALE. &lsquo;You had better prove it before you put it into your book on natural history. You may do it in my stable if you will.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Nay, Sir, I would not have him prove it. If he is content to take his information from others, he may get through his book with little trouble, and without much endangering his reputation. But if he makes experiments for so comprehensive a book as his, there would be no end to them: his erroneous assertions would then fall upon himself, and he might be blamed for not having made experiments as to every particular.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">The character of Mallet having been introduced, and spoken of slightingly by Goldsmith; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, Mallet had talents enough to keep his literary reputation alive as long as he himself lived; and that, let me tell you, is a good deal.&rsquo; GOLDSMITH. &lsquo;But I cannot agree that it was so. His literary reputation was dead long before his natural death. I consider an authour&rsquo;s literary reputation to be alive only while his name will ensure a good price for his copy from the booksellers. I will get you (to Johnson,) a hundred guineas for any thing whatever that you shall write, if you put your name to it.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Dr. Goldmith&rsquo;s new play, <span class="t8">She Stoops to Conquer</span>, being mentioned; JOHNSON. &lsquo;I know of no comedy for many years that has so much exhilarated an audience, that has answered so much the great end of comedy &mdash; making an audience merry.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Goldsmith having said, that Garrick&rsquo;s compliment to the Queen, which he introduced into the play of <span class="t8">The Chances</span>, which he had altered and revised this year, was mean and gross flattery; &mdash; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, I would not <span class="t8">write</span>, I would not give solemnly under my hand, a character beyond what I thought really true; but a speech on the stage, let it flatter ever so extravagantly, is formular. It has always been formular to flatter Kings and Queens; so much so, that even in our church-service we have &ldquo;our most religious King,&rdquo; used indiscriminately, whoever is King. Nay, they even flatter themselves;&mdash; &ldquo;we have been graciously pleased to grant.&rdquo; No modern flattery, however, is so gross as that of the Augustan age, where the Emperour was deified. &ldquo;<span class="t8">Praesens Divus habebitur Augustus</span>.&rdquo; And as to meanness, (rising into warmth,) how is it mean in a player, &mdash; a showman, &mdash; a fellow who exhibits himself for a shilling, to flatter his Queen? The attempt, indeed, was dangerous; for if it had missed, what became of Garrick, and what became of the Queen? As Sir William Temple says of a great General, it is necessary not only that his designs be formed in a masterly manner, but that they should be attended with success. Sir, it is right, at a time when the Royal Family is not generally liked, to let it be seen that the people like at least one of them.&rsquo; SIR JOSHUA REYNOLDS. &lsquo;I do not perceive why the profession of a player should be despised; for the great and ultimate end of all the employments of mankind is to produce amusement. Garrick produces more amusement than any body.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;You say, Dr. Johnson, that Garrick exhibits himself for a shilling. In this respect he is only on a footing with a lawyer who exhibits himself for his fee, and even will maintain any nonsense or absurdity, if the case requires it. Garrick refuses a play or a part which he does not like; a lawyer never refuses.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, what does this prove? only that a lawyer is worse. Boswell is now like Jack in <span class="t8">The Tale of a Tub</span>, who, when he is puzzled by an argument, hangs himself. He thinks I shall cut him down, but I&rsquo;ll let him hang&rsquo; (laughing vociferously). SIR JOSHUA REYNOLDS. &lsquo;Mr. Boswell thinks that the profession of a lawyer being unquestionably honourable, if he can show the profession of a player to be more honourable, he proves his argument.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Friday, April 30, I dined with him at Mr. Beauclerk&rsquo;s, where were Lord Charlemont, Sir Joshua Reynolds, and some more members of the LITERARY CLUB, whom he had obligingly invited to meet me, as I was this evening to be balloted for as candidate for admission into that distinguished society. Johnson had done me the honour to propose me, and Beauclerk was very zealous for me.</p>
<p class="p24">Goldsmith being mentioned; JOHNSON. &lsquo;It is amazing how little Goldsmith knows. He seldom comes where he is not more ignorant than any one else.&rsquo; SIR JOSHUA REYNOLDS. &lsquo;Yet there is no man whose company is more liked.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;To be sure, Sir. When people find a man of the most distinguished abilities as a writer, their inferiour while he is with them, it must be highly gratifying to them. What Goldsmith comically says of himself is very true, &mdash; he always gets the better when he argues alone; meaning, that he is master of a subject in his study, and can write well upon it; but when he comes into company, grows confused, and unable to talk. Take him as a poet, his <span class="t8">Traveller</span> is a very fine performance; ay, and so is his <span class="t8">Deserted Village</span>, were it not sometimes too much the echo of his <span class="t8">Traveller</span>. Whether, indeed, we take him as a poet, &mdash; as a comick writer, &mdash; or as an historian, he stands in the first class.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;An historian! My dear Sir, you surely will not rank his compilation of the Roman History with the works of other historians of this age?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, who are before him?&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Hume, &mdash; Robertson, &mdash; Lord Lyttelton.&rsquo; JOHNSON (his antipathy to the Scotch beginning to rise). &lsquo;I have not read Hume; but, doubtless, Goldsmith&rsquo;s <span class="t8">History</span> is better than the <span class="t8">verbiage</span> of Robertson, or the foppery of Dalrymple.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Will you not admit the superiority of Robertson, in whose <span class="t8">History</span> we find such penetration &mdash; such painting?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, you must consider how that penetration and that painting are employed. It is not history, it is imagination. He who describes what he never saw, draws from fancy. Robertson paints minds as Sir Joshua paints faces in a history-piece: he imagines an heroic countenance. You must look upon Robertson&rsquo;s work as romance, and try it by that standard.History it is not. Besides, Sir, it is the great excellence of a writer to put into his book as much as his book will hold. Goldsmith has done this in his <span class="t8">History</span>. Now Robertson might have put twice as much into his book. Robertson is like a man who has packed gold in wool: the wool takes up more room than the gold. No, Sir; I always thought Robertson would be crushed by his own weight, &mdash; would be buried under his own ornaments. Goldsmith tells you shortly all you want to know: Robertson detains you a great deal too long. No man will read Robertson&rsquo;s cumbrous detail a second time; but Goldsmith&rsquo;s plain narrative will please again and again. I would say to Robertson what an old tutor of a college said to one of his pupils: &ldquo;Read over your compositions, and where ever you meet with a passage which you think is particularly fine, strike it out.&rdquo; Goldsmith&rsquo;s abridgement is better than that of Lucius Florus or Eutropius; and I will venture to say, that if you compare him with Vertot, in the same places of the Roman History, you will find that he excels Vertot. Sir, he has the art of compiling, and of saying every thing he has to say in a pleasing manner. He is now writing a Natural History and will make it as entertaining as a Persian Tale.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I cannot dismiss the present topick without observing, that it is probable that Dr. Johnson, who owned that he often &lsquo;talked for victory,&rsquo; rather urged plausible objections to Dr. Robertson&rsquo;s excellent historical works, in the ardour of contest, than expressed his real and decided opinion; for it is not easy to suppose, that he should so widely differ from the rest of the literary world.</p>
<p class="p26">JOHNSON. &lsquo;I remember once being with Goldsmith in Westminster-abbey.<br/>While we surveyed the Poets&rsquo; Corner, I said to him,</p>
<p class="p24">&ldquo;<span class="t8">Forsitan et nostrum nomen miscebitur istis</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">When we got to Temple-bar he stopped me, pointed to the heads upon it, and slily whispered me,</p>
<p class="p24">&ldquo;<span class="t8">Forsitan et nostrum nomen miscebitur</span> ISTIS.&rdquo;&rsquo;.</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson praised John Bunyan highly. &lsquo;His <span class="t8">Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress</span> has great merit, both for invention, imagination, and the conduct of the story; and it has had the best evidence of its merit, the general and continued approbation of mankind. Few books, I believe, have had a more extensive sale. It is remarkable, that it begins very much like the poem of Dante; yet there was no translation of Dante when Bunyan wrote. There is reason to think that he had read Spenser.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">A proposition which had been agitated, that monuments to eminent persons should, for the time to come, be erected in St. Paul&rsquo;s church as well as in Westminster-abbey, was mentioned; and it was asked, who should be honoured by having his monument first erected there. Somebody suggested Pope. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, as Pope was a Roman Catholick, I would not have his to be first. I think Milton&rsquo;s rather should have the precedence. I think more highly of him now than I did at twenty. There is more thinking in him and in Butler, than in any of our poets.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Some of the company expressed a wonder why the authour of so excellent a book as <span class="t8">The Whole Duty of Man</span> should conceal himself. JOHNSON. &lsquo;There may be different reasons assigned for this, any one of which would be very sufficient. He may have been a clergyman, and may have thought that his religious counsels would have less weight when known to come from a man whose profession was Theology. He may have been a man whose practice was not suitable to his principles, so that his character might injure the effect of his book, which he had written in a season of penitence. Or he may have been a man of rigid self-denial, so that he would have no reward for his pious labours while in this world, but refer it all to a future state.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">The gentlemen went away to their club, and I was left at Beauclerk&rsquo;s till the fate of my election should be announced to me. I sat in a state of anxiety which even the charming conversation of Lady Di Beauclerk could not entirely dissipate. In a short time I received the agreeable intelligence that I was chosen. I hastened to the place of meeting, and was introduced to such a society as can seldom be found. Mr. Edmund Burke, whom I then saw for the first time, and whose splendid talents had long made me ardently wish for his acquaintance; Dr. Nugent, Mr. Garrick, Dr. Goldsmith, Mr. (afterwards Sir William) Jones, and the company with whom I had dined. Upon my entrance, Johnson placed himself behind a chair, on which he leaned as on a desk or pulpit, and with humorous formality gave me a <span class="t8">Charge</span>, pointing out the conduct expected from me as a good member of this club.</p>
<p class="p24">Goldsmith produced some very absurd verses which had been publickly recited to an audience for money. JOHNSON. &lsquo;I can match this nonsense. There was a poem called <span class="t8">Eugenio</span>, which came out some years ago, and concludes thus:</p>
<p class="p26">&ldquo;And now, ye trifling, self-assuming elves,<br/>&nbsp;Brimful of pride, of nothing, of yourselves,<br/>&nbsp;Survey Eugenio, view him o&rsquo;er and o&rsquo;er,<br/>&nbsp;Then sink into yourselves, and be no more.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Nay, Dryden in his poem on the Royal Society, has these lines:</p>
<p class="p26">&ldquo;Then we upon our globe&rsquo;s last verge shall go,<br/>&nbsp;And see the ocean leaning on the sky;<br/>&nbsp;From thence our rolling neighbours we shall know,<br/>&nbsp;And on the lunar world securely pry.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Talking of puns, Johnson, who had a great contempt for that species of wit, deigned to allow that there was one good pun in <span class="t8">Menagiana</span>, I think on the word <span class="t8">corps</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">Much pleasant conversation passed, which Johnson relished with great good humour. But his conversation alone, or what led to it, or was interwoven with it, is the business of this work.</p>
<p class="p24">On Saturday, May 1, we dined by ourselves at our old rendezvous, the Mitre tavern. He was placid, but not much disposed to talk. He observed that &lsquo;The Irish mix better with the English than the Scotch do; their language is nearer to English; as a proof of which, they succeed very well as players, which Scotchmen do not. Then, Sir, they have not that extreme nationality which we find in the Scotch. I will do you, Boswell, the justice to say, that you are the most <span class="t8">unscottified</span> of your countrymen. You are almost the only instance of a Scotchman that I have known, who did not at every other sentence bring in some other Scotchman.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">We drank tea with Mrs. Williams. I introduced a question which has been much agitated in the Church of Scotland, whether the claim of lay-patrons to present ministers to parishes be well founded; and supposing it to be well founded, whether it ought to be exercised without the concurrence of the people? That Church is composed of a series of judicatures: a Presbytery, a Synod, and finally, a General Assembly; before all of which, this matter may be contended: and in some cases the Presbytery having refused to induct or <span class="t8">settle</span>, as they call it, the person presented by the patron, it has been found necessary to appeal to the General Assembly. He said, I might see the subject well treated in the <span class="t8">Defence of Pluralities</span>; and although he thought that a patron should exercise his right with tenderness to the inclinations of the people of a parish, he was very clear as to his right. Then supposing the question to be pleaded before the General Assembly, he dictated to me what follows:</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Against the right of patrons is commonly opposed, by the inferiour judicatures, the plea of conscience. Their conscience tells them, that the people ought to choose their pastor; their conscience tells them that they ought not to impose upon a congregation a minister ungrateful and unacceptable to his auditors. Conscience is nothing more than a conviction felt by ourselves of something to be done, or something to be avoided; and in questions of simple unperplexed morality, conscience is very often a guide that may be trusted. But before conscience can determine, the state of the question is supposed to be completely known. In questions of law, or of fact, conscience is very often confounded with opinion. No man&rsquo;s conscience can tell him the right of another man; they must be known by rational investigation or historical enquiry. Opinion, which he that holds it may call his conscience, may teach some men that religion would be promoted, and quiet preserved, by granting to the people universally the choice of their ministers. But it is a conscience very ill informed that violates the rights of one man, for the convenience of another. Religion cannot be promoted by injustice: and it was never yet found that a popular election was very quietly transacted.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;That justice would be violated by transferring to the people the right of patronage, is apparent to all who know whence that right had its original. The right of patronage was not at first a privilege torn by power from unresisting poverty. It is not an authority at first usurped in times of ignorance, and established only by succession and by precedents. It is not a grant capriciously made from a higher tyrant to a lower. It is a right dearly purchased by the first possessors, and justly inherited by those that succeeded them. When Christianity was established in this island, a regular mode of publick worship was prescribed. Publick worship requires a publick place; and the proprietors of lands, as they were converted, built churches for their families and their vassals. For the maintenance of ministers, they settled a certain portion of their lands; and a district, through which each minister was required to extend his care, was, by that circumscription, constituted a parish. This is a position so generally received in England, that the extent of a manor and of a parish are regularly received for each other. The churches which the proprietors of lands had thus built and thus endowed, they justly thought themselves entitled to provide with ministers; and where the episcopal government prevails, the Bishop has no power to reject a man nominated by the patron, but for some crime that might exclude him from the priesthood. For the endowment of the church being the gift of the landlord, he was consequently at liberty to give it according to his choice, to any man capable of performing the holy offices. The people did not choose him, because the people did not pay him.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;We hear it sometimes urged, that this original right is passed out of memory, and is obliterated and obscured by many translations of property and changes of government; that scarce any church is now in the hands of the heirs of the builders; and that the present persons have entered subsequently upon the pretended rights by a thousand accidental and unknown causes. Much of this, perhaps, is true. But how is the right of patronage extinguished? If the right followed the lands, it is possessed by the same equity by which the lands are possessed. It is, in effect, part of the manor, and protected by the same laws with every other privilege. Let us suppose an estate forfeited by treason, and granted by the Crown to a new family. With the lands were forfeited all the rights appendant to those lands; by the same power that grants the lands, the rights also are granted. The right lost to the patron falls not to the people, but is either retained by the Crown, or what to the people is the same thing, is by the Crown given away. Let it change hands ever so often, it is possessed by him that receives it with the same right as it was conveyed. It may, indeed, like all our possessions, be forcibly seized or fraudulently obtained. But no injury is still done to the people; for what they never had, they have never lost. Caius may usurp the right of Titius; but neither Caius nor Titius injure the people; and no man&rsquo;s conscience, however tender or however active, can prompt him to restore what may be proved to have been never taken away. Supposing, what I think cannot be proved, that a popular election of ministers were to be desired, our desires are not the measure of equity. It were to be desired that power should be only in the hands of the merciful, and riches in the possession of the generous; but the law must leave both riches and power where it finds them: and must often leave riches with the covetous, and power with the cruel. Convenience may be a rule in little things, where no other rule has been established. But as the great end of government is to give every man his own, no inconvenience is greater than that of making right uncertain. Nor is any man more an enemy to publick peace, than he who fills weak heads with imaginary claims, and breaks the series of civil subordination, by inciting the lower classes of mankind to encroach upon the higher.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Having thus shown that the right of patronage, being originally purchased, may be legally transferred, and that it is now in the hands of lawful possessors, at least as certainly as any other right; &mdash; we have left to the advocates of the people no other plea than that of convenience. Let us, therefore, now consider what the people would really gain by a general abolition of the right of patronage. What is most to be desired by such a change is, that the country should be supplied with better ministers. But why should we suppose that the parish will make a wiser choice than the patron? If we suppose mankind actuated by interest, the patron is more likely to choose with caution, because he will suffer more by choosing wrong. By the deficiencies of his minister, or by his vices, he is equally offended with the rest of the congregation; but he will have this reason more to lament them, that they will be imputed to his absurdity or corruption. The qualifications of a minister are well known to be learning and piety. Of his learning the patron is probably the only judge in the parish; and of his piety not less a judge than others; and is more likely to enquire minutely and diligently before he gives a presentation, than one of the parochial rabble, who can give nothing but a vote. It may be urged, that though the parish might not choose better ministers, they would at least choose ministers whom they like better, and who would therefore officiate with greater efficacy. That ignorance and perverseness should always obtain what they like, was never considered as the end of government; of which it is the great and standing benefit, that the wise see for the simple, and the regular act for the capricious. But that this argument supposes the people capable of judging, and resolute to act according to their best judgments, though this be sufficiently absurd, it is not all its absurdity. It supposes not only wisdom, but unanimity in those, who upon no other occasions are unanimous or wise. If by some strange concurrence all the voices of a parish should unite in the choice of any single man, though I could not charge the patron with injustice for presenting a minister, I should censure him as unkind and injudicious. But, it is evident, that as in all other popular elections there will be contrariety of judgment and acrimony of passion, a parish upon every vacancy would break into factions, and the contest for the choice of a minister would set neighbours at variance, and bring discord into families. The minister would be taught all the arts of a candidate, would flatter some, and bribe others; and the electors, as in all other cases, would call for holidays and ale, and break the heads of each other during the jollity of the canvas. The time must, however, come at last, when one of the factions must prevail, and one of the ministers get possession of the church. On what terms does he enter upon his ministry but those of enmity with half his parish? By what prudence or what diligence can he hope to conciliate the affections of that party by whose defeat he has obtained his living? Every man who voted against him will enter the church with hanging head and downcast eyes, afraid to encounter that neighbour by whose vote and influence he has been overpowered. He will hate his neighbour for opposing him, and his minister for having prospered by the opposition; and as he will never see him but with pain, he will never see him but with hatred. Of a minister presented by the patron, the parish has seldom any thing worse to say than that they do not know him. Of a minister chosen by a popular contest, all those who do not favour him, have nursed up in their bosoms principles of hatred and reasons of rejection. Anger is excited principally by pride. The pride of a common man is very little exasperated by the supposed usurpation of an acknowledged superiour. He bears only his little share of a general evil, and suffers in common with the whole parish; but when the contest is between equals, the defeat has many aggravations; and he that is defeated by his next neighbour, is seldom satisfied without some revenge; and it is hard to say what bitterness of malignity would prevail in a parish where these elections should happen to be frequent, and the enmity of opposition should be re-kindled before it had cooled.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Though I present to my readers Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s masterly thoughts on the subject, I think it proper to declare, that notwithstanding I am myself a lay patron, I do not entirely subscribe to his opinion.</p>
<p class="p24">On Friday, May 7, I breakfasted with him at Mr. Thrale&rsquo;s in the Borough. While we were alone, I endeavoured as well as I could to apologise for a lady who had been divorced from her husband by act of Parliament. I said, that he had used her very ill, had behaved brutally to her, and that she could not continue to live with him without having her delicacy contaminated; that all affection for him was thus destroyed; that the essence of conjugal union being gone, there remained only a cold form, a mere civil obligation; that she was in the prime of life, with qualities to produce happiness; that these ought not to be lost; and, that the gentleman on whose account she was divorced had gained her heart while thus unhappily situated. Seduced, perhaps, by the charms of the lady in question, I thus attempted to palliate what I was sensible could not be justified; for when I had finished my harangue, my venerable friend gave me a proper check: &lsquo;My dear Sir, never accustom your mind to mingle virtue and vice. The woman&rsquo;s a whore, and there&rsquo;s an end on&rsquo;t.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He described the father of one of his friends thus: &lsquo;Sir, he was so exuberant a talker at publick meeting, that the gentlemen of his county were afraid of him. No business could be done for his declamation.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He did not give me full credit when I mentioned that I had carried on a short conversation by signs with some Esquimaux who were then in London, particularly with one of them who was a priest. He thought I could not make them understand me. No man was more incredulous as to particular facts, which were at all extraordinary; and therefore no man was more scrupulously inquisitive, in order to discover the truth.</p>
<p class="p24">I dined with him this day at the house of my friends, Messieurs Edward and Charles Dilly, booksellers in the Poultry: there were present, their elder brother Mr. Dilly of Bedfordshire, Dr. Goldsmith, Mr. Langton, Mr. Claxton, Reverend Dr. Mayo a dissenting minister, the Reverend Mr. Toplady, and my friend the Reverend Mr. Temple.</p>
<p class="p24">Hawkesworth&rsquo;s compilation of the voyages to the South Sea being mentioned; &mdash; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, if you talk of it as a subject of commerce, it will be gainful; if as a book that is to increase human knowledge, I believe there will not be much of that. Hawkesworth can tell only what the voyagers have told him; and they have found very little, only one new animal, I think.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;But many insects, Sir.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, as to insects, Ray reckons of British insects twenty thousand species. They might have staid at home and discovered enough in that way.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Talking of birds, I mentioned Mr. Daines Barrington&rsquo;s ingenious Essay against the received notion of their migration. JOHNSON. &lsquo;I think we have as good evidence for the migration of woodcocks as can be desired. We find they disappear at a certain time of the year, and appear again at a certain time of the year; and some of them, when weary in their flight, have been known to alight on the rigging of ships far out at sea.&rsquo; One of the company observed, that there had been instances of some of them found in summer in Essex. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, that strengthens our argument. <span class="t8">Exceptio probat regulam</span>. Some being found shews, that, if all remained, many would be found. A few sick or lame ones may be found.&rsquo; GOLDSMITH. &lsquo;There is a partial migration of the swallows; the stronger ones migrate, the others do not.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">BOSWELL. &lsquo;I am well assured that the people of Otaheite who have the bread tree, the fruit of which serves them for bread, laughed heartily when they were informed of the tedious process necessary with us to have bread; &mdash; plowing, sowing, harrowing, reaping, threshing, grinding, baking.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, all ignorant savages will laugh when they are told of the advantages of civilized life. Were you to tell men who live without houses, how we pile brick upon brick, and rafter upon rafter, and that after a house is raised to a certain height, a man tumbles off a scaffold, and breaks his neck; he would laugh heartily at our folly in building; but it does not follow that men are better without houses. No, Sir, (holding up a slice of a good loaf,) this is better than the bread tree.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He repeated an argument, which is to be found in his <span class="t8">Rambler</span>, against the notion that the brute creation is endowed with the faculty of reason: &lsquo;birds build by instinct; they never improve; they build their first nest as well as any one they ever build.&rsquo; GOLDSMITH. &lsquo;Yet we see if you take away a bird&rsquo;s nest with the eggs in it, she will make a slighter nest and lay again.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, that is because at first she has full time and makes her nest deliberately. In the case you mention she is pressed to lay, and must therefore make her nest quickly, and consequently it will be slight.&rsquo; GOLDSMITH. &lsquo;The identification of birds is what is least known in natural history, though one of the most curious things in it.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I introduced the subject of toleration. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Every society has a right to preserve publick peace and order, and therefore has a good right to prohibit the propagation of opinions which have a dangerous tendency. To say the <span class="t8">magistrate</span> has this right, is using an inadequate word: it is the <span class="t8">society</span> for which the magistrate is agent. He may be morally or theologically wrong in restraining the propagation of opinions which he thinks dangerous, but he is politically right.&rsquo; MAYO. &lsquo;I am of opinion, Sir, that every man is entitled to liberty of conscience in religion; and that the magistrate cannot restrain that right.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, I agree with you. Every man has a right to liberty of conscience, and with that the magistrate cannot interfere. People confound liberty of thinking with liberty of talking; nay, with liberty of preaching. Every man has a physical right to think as he pleases; for it cannot be discovered how he thinks. He has not a moral right, for he ought to inform himself, and think justly. But, Sir, no member of a society has a right to <span class="t8">teach</span> any doctrine contrary to what the society holds to be true. The magistrate, I say, may be wrong in what he thinks: but while he thinks himself right, he may and ought to enforce what he thinks.&rsquo; MAYO. &lsquo;Then, Sir, we are to remain always in errour, and truth never can prevail; and the magistrate was right in persecuting the first Christians.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, the only method by which religious truth can be established is by martyrdom. The magistrate has a right to enforce what he thinks; and he who is conscious of the truth has a right to suffer. I am afraid there is no other way of ascertaining the truth, but by persecution on the one hand and enduring it on the other.&rsquo; GOLDSMITH. &lsquo;But how is a man to act, Sir? Though firmly convinced of the truth of his doctrine, may he not think it wrong to expose himself to persecution? Has he a right to do so? Is it not, as it were, committing voluntary suicide?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, as to voluntary suicide, as you call it, there are twenty thousand men in an army who will go without scruple to be shot at, and mount a breach for five-pence a day.&rsquo; GOLDSMITH. &lsquo;But have they a moral right to do this?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Nay, Sir, if you will not take the universal opinion of mankind, I have nothing to say. If mankind cannot defend their own way of thinking, I cannot defend it. Sir, if a man is in doubt whether it would be better for him to expose himself to martyrdom or not, he should not do it. He must be convinced that he has a delegation from heaven.&rsquo; GOLDSMITH. &lsquo;I would consider whether there is the greater chance of good or evil upon the whole. If I see a man who had fallen into a well, I would wish to help him out; but if there is a greater probability that he shall pull me in, than that I shall pull him out, I would not attempt it. So were I to go to Turkey, I might wish to convert the Grand Signor to the Christian faith; but when I considered that I should probably be put to death without effectuating my purpose in any degree, I should keep myself quiet.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir you must consider that we have perfect and imperfect obligations. Perfect obligations, which are generally not to do something, are clear and positive; as, &lsquo;thou shalt not kill.&rsquo; But charity, for instance, is not definable by limits. It is a duty to give to the poor; but no man can say how much another should give to the poor, or when a man has given too little to save his soul. In the same manner it is a duty to instruct the ignorant, and of consequence to convert infidels to Christianity; but no man in the common course of things is obliged to carry this to such a degree as to incur the danger of martyrdom, as no man is obliged to strip himself to the shirt in order to give charity. I have said, that a man must be persuaded that he has a particular delegation from heaven.&rsquo; GOLDSMITH. &lsquo;How is this to be known? Our first reformers, who were burnt for not believing bread and wine to be CHRIST&rsquo; &mdash; JOHNSON, (interrupting him,) &lsquo;Sir, they were not burnt for not believing bread and wine to be CHRIST, but for insulting those who did believe it. And, Sir, when the first reformers began, they did not intend to be martyred: as many of them ran away as could.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;But, Sir, there was your countryman, Elwal, who you told me challenged King George with his black-guards, and his red-guards.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;My countryman, Elwal, Sir, should have been put in the stocks; a proper pulpit for him; and he&rsquo;d have had a numerous audience. A man who preaches in the stocks will always have hearers enough.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;But Elwal thought himself in the right.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;We are not providing for mad people; there are places for them in the neighbourhood&rsquo; (meaning Moorfields). MAYO. &lsquo;But, Sir, is it not very hard that I should not be allowed to teach my children what I really believe to be the truth?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, you might contrive to teach your children <span class="t8">extrà scandalum</span>; but, Sir, the magistrate, if he knows it, has a right to restrain you. Suppose you teach your children to be thieves?&rsquo; MAYO. &lsquo;This is making a joke of the subject.&rsquo; JOHNSON.&rsquo; &lsquo;Nay, Sir, take it thus: &mdash; that you teach them the community of goods; for which there are as many plausible arguments as for most erroneous doctrines. You teach them that all things at first were in common, and that no man had a right to any thing but as he laid his hands upon it; and that this still is, or ought to be, the rule amongst mankind. Here, Sir, you sap a great principle in society, &mdash; property. And don&rsquo;t you think the magistrate would have a right to prevent you? Or, suppose you should teach your children the notion of the Adamites, and they should run naked into the streets, would not the magistrate have a right to flog &rsquo;em into their doublets?&rsquo; MAYO. &lsquo;I think the magistrate has no right to interfere till there is some overt act.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;So, Sir, though he sees an enemy to the state charging a blunderbuss, he is not to interfere till it is fired off?&rsquo; MAYO. &lsquo;He must be sure of its direction against the state.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;The magistrate is to judge of that. &mdash; He has no right to restrain your thinking, because the evil centers in yourself. If a man were sitting at this table, and chopping off his fingers, the magistrate, as guardian of the community, has no authority to restrain him, however he might do it from kindness as a parent. &mdash; Though, indeed, upon more consideration, I think he may; as it is probable, that he who is chopping off his own fingers, may soon proceed to chop off those of other people. If I think it right to steal Mr. Dilly&rsquo;s plate, I am a bad man; but he can say nothing to me. If I make an open declaration that I think so, he will keep me out of his house. If I put forth my hand, I shall be sent to Newgate. This is the gradation of thinking, preaching, and acting: if a man thinks erroneously, he may keep his thoughts to himself, and nobody will trouble him; if he preaches erroneous doctrine, society may expel him; if he acts in consequence of it, the law takes place, and he is hanged.&rsquo; MAYO. &lsquo;But, Sir, ought not Christians to have liberty of conscience?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;I have already told you so, Sir. You are coming back to where you were,&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Dr. Mayo is always taking a return post-chaise, and going the stage over again. He has it at half price.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Dr. Mayo, like other champions for unlimited toleration, has got a set of words. Sir, it is no matter, politically, whether the magistrate be right or wrong. Suppose a club were to be formed, to drink confusion to King George the Third, and a happy restoration to Charles the Third, this would be very bad with respect to the State; but every member of that club must either conform to its rules, or be turned out of it. Old Baxter, I remember, maintains, that the magistrate should &ldquo;tolerate all things that are tolerable.&rdquo; This is no good definition of toleration upon any principle; but it shews that he thought some things were not tolerable.&rsquo; TOPLADY. &lsquo;Sir, you have untwisted this difficult subject with great dexterity.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">During this argument, Goldsmith sat in restless agitation, from a wish to get in and <span class="t8">shine</span>. Finding himself excluded, he had taken his hat to go away, but remained for some time with it in his hand, like a gamester, who at the close of a long night, lingers for a little while, to see if he can have a favourable opening to finish with success. Once when he was beginning to speak, he found himself overpowered by the loud voice of Johnson, who was at the opposite end of the table, and did not perceive Goldsmith&rsquo;s attempt. Thus disappointed of his wish to obtain the attention of the company, Goldsmith in a passion threw down his hat, looking angrily at Johnson, and exclaiming in a bitter tone, &lsquo;<span class="t8">Take it</span>.&rsquo; When Toplady was going to speak, Johnson uttered some sound, which led Goldsmith to think that he was beginning again, and taking the words from Toplady. Upon which, he seized this opportunity of venting his own envy and spleen, under the pretext of supporting another person: &lsquo;Sir, (said he to Johnson,) the gentleman has heard you patiently for an hour; pray allow us now to hear him.&rsquo; JOHNSON. (sternly,) &lsquo;Sir, I was not interrupting the gentleman. I was only giving him a signal of my attention. Sir, you are impertinent.&rsquo; Goldsmith made no reply, but continued in the company for some time.</p>
<p class="p24">A gentleman present ventured to ask Dr. Johnson if there was not a material difference as to toleration of opinions which lead to action, and opinions merely speculative; for instance, would it be wrong in the magistrate to tolerate those who preach against the doctrine of the TRINITY? Johnson was highly offended, and said, &lsquo;I wonder, Sir, how a gentleman of your piety can introduce this subject in a mixed company.&rsquo; He told me afterwards, that the impropriety was, that perhaps some of the company might have talked on the subject in such terms as might have shocked him; or he might have been forced to appear in their eyes a narrow-minded man. The gentleman, with submissive deference, said, he had only hinted at the question from a desire to hear Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s opinion upon it. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why then, Sir, I think that permitting men to preach any opinion contrary to the doctrine of the established church tends, in a certain degree, to lessen the authority of the church, and consequently, to lessen the influence of religion.&rsquo; &lsquo;It may be considered, (said the gentleman,) whether it would not be politick to tolerate in such a case.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, we have been talking of <span class="t8">right</span>: this is another question. I think it is <span class="t8">not</span> politick to tolerate in such a case.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Though he did not think it fit that so aweful a subject should be introduced in a mixed company, and therefore at this time waved the theological question; yet his own orthodox belief in the sacred mystery of the TRINITY is evinced beyond doubt, by the following passage in his private devotions:</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;O LORD, hear my prayer [prayers], for JESUS CHRIST&rsquo;S sake; to whom with thee and the HOLY GHOST, <span class="t8">three persons and one</span> GOD, be all honour and glory, world without end, Amen.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">BOSWELL. &lsquo;Pray, Mr. Dilly, how does Dr. Leland&rsquo;s <span class="t8">History of Ireland</span> sell?&rsquo; JOHNSON, (bursting forth with a generous indignation,) &lsquo;The Irish are in a most unnatural state; for we see there the minority prevailing over the majority. There is no instance, even in the ten persecutions, of such severity as that which the protestants of Ireland have exercised against the Catholicks. Did we tell them we have conquered them, it would be above board: to punish them by confiscation and other penalties, as rebels, was monstrous injustice. King William was not their lawful sovereign: he had not been acknowledged by the Parliament of Ireland, when they appeared in arms against him.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I here suggested something favourable of the Roman Catholicks. TOPLADY. &lsquo;Does not their invocation of saints suppose omnipresence in the saints?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;No, Sir; it supposes only pluri-presence, and when spirits are divested of matter, it seems probable that they should see with more extent than when in an embodied state. There is, therefore, no approach to an invasion of any of the divine attributes, in the invocation of saints. But I think it is will-worship, and presumption. I see no command for it, and therefore think it is safer not to practise it.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He and Mr. Langton and I went together to THE CLUB, where we found Mr. Burke, Mr. Garrick, and some other members, and amongst them our friend Goldsmith, who sat silently brooding over Johnson&rsquo;s reprimand to him after dinner. Johnson perceived this, and said aside to some of us, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll make Goldsmith forgive me;&rsquo; and then called to him in a loud voice, &lsquo;Dr. Goldsmith, &mdash; something passed to-day where you and I dined; I ask your pardon.&rsquo; Goldsmith answered placidly, &lsquo;It must be much from you, Sir, that I take ill.&rsquo; And so at once the difference was over, and they were on as easy terms as ever, and Goldsmith rattled away as usual.</p>
<p class="p24">In our way to the club to-night, when I regretted that Goldsmith would, upon every occasion, endeavour to shine, by which he often exposed himself, Mr. Langton observed, that he was not like Addison, who was content with the fame of his writings, and did not aim also at excellency in conversation, for which he found himself unfit; and that he said to a lady who complained of his having talked little in company, &lsquo;Madam, I have but nine-pence in ready money, but I can draw for a thousand pound.&rsquo; I observed, that Goldsmith had a great deal of gold in his cabinet, but, not content with that, was always taking out his purse. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Yes, Sir, and that so often an empty purse!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Goldsmith&rsquo;s incessant desire of being conspicuous in company, was the occasion of his sometimes appearing to such disadvantage as one should hardly have supposed possible in a man of his genius. When his literary reputation had risen deservedly high, and his society was much courted, he became very jealous of the extraordinary attention which was every where paid to Johnson. One evening, in a circle of wits, he found fault with me for talking of Johnson as entitled to the honour of unquestionable superiority. &lsquo;Sir, (said he,) you are for making a monarchy of what should be a republick.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He was still more mortified, when talking in a company with fluent vivacity, and, as he flattered himself, to the admiration of all who were present; a German who sat next him, and perceived Johnson rolling himself, as if about to speak, suddenly stopped him, saying, &lsquo;Stay, stay, &mdash; Toctor Shonson is going to say something.&rsquo; This was, no doubt, very provoking, especially to one so irritable as Goldsmith, who frequently mentioned it with strong expressions of indignation.</p>
<p class="p24">It may also be observed, that Goldsmith was sometimes content to be treated with an easy familiarity, but, upon occasions, would be consequential and important. An instance of this occurred in a small particular. Johnson had a way of contracting the names of his friends; as Beauclerk, Beau; Boswell, Bozzy; Langton, Lanky; Murphy, Mur; Sheridan, Sherry. I remember one day, when Tom Davies was telling that Dr. Johnson said, &lsquo;We are all in labour for a name to <span class="t8">Goldy&rsquo;s</span> play,&rsquo; Goldsmith seemed displeased that such a liberty should be taken with his name, and said, &lsquo;I have often desired him not to call me <span class="t8">Goldy</span>.&rsquo; Tom was remarkably attentive to the most minute circumstance about Johnson. I recollect his telling me once, on my arrival in London, &lsquo;Sir, our great friend has made an improvement on his appellation of old Mr. Sheridan. He calls him now <span class="t8">Sherry derry</span>.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To THE REVEREND MR. BAGSHAW, AT BROMLEY.</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I return you my sincere thanks for your additions to my <span class="t8">Dictionary</span>; but the new edition has been published some time, and therefore I cannot now make use of them. Whether I shall ever revise it more, I know not. If many readers had been as judicious, as diligent, and as communicative as yourself, my work had been better. The world must at present take it as it is. I am, Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your most obliged</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;And most humble servant,</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;May 8, 1773.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Sunday, May 8, I dined with Johnson at Mr. Langton&rsquo;s with Dr. Beattie and some other company. He descanted on the subject of Literary Property. &lsquo;There seems (said he,) to be in authours a stronger right of property than that by occupancy; a metaphysical right, a right, as it were, of creation, which should from its nature be perpetual; but the consent of nations is against it, and indeed reason and the interests of learning are against it; for were it to be perpetual, no book, however useful, could be universally diffused amongst mankind, should the proprietor take it into his head to restrain its circulation. No book could have the advantage of being edited with notes, however necessary to its elucidation, should the proprietor perversely oppose it. For the general good of the world, therefore, whatever valuable work has once been created by an authour, and issued out by him, should be understood as no longer in his power, but as belonging to the publick; at the same time the authour is entitled to an adequate reward. This he should have by an exclusive right to his work for a considerable number of years.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He attacked Lord Monboddo&rsquo;s strange speculation on the primitive state of human nature; observing, &lsquo;Sir, it is all conjecture about a thing useless, even were it known to be true. Knowledge of all kinds is good. Conjecture, as to things useful, is good; but conjecture as to what it would be useless to know, such as whether men went upon all four, is very idle.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Monday, May 9, as I was to set out on my return to Scotland next morning, I was desirous to see as much of Dr. Johnson as I could. But I first called on Goldsmith to take leave of him. The jealousy and envy which, though possessed of many most amiable qualities, he frankly avowed, broke out violently at this interview. Upon another occasion, when Goldsmith confessed himself to be of an envious disposition, I contended with Johnson that we ought not to be angry with him, he was so candid in owning it. &lsquo;Nay, Sir, (said Johnson,) we must be angry that a man has such a superabundance of an odious quality, that he cannot keep it within his own breast, but it boils over.&rsquo; In my opinion, however, Goldsmith had not more of it than other people have, but only talked of it freely.</p>
<p class="p24">He now seemed very angry that Johnson was going to be a traveller; said &lsquo;he would be a dead weight for me to carry, and that I should never be able to lug him along through the Highlands and Hebrides.&rsquo; Nor would he patiently allow me to enlarge upon Johnson&rsquo;s wonderful abilities; but exclaimed, &lsquo;Is he like Burke, who winds into a subject like a serpent?&rsquo; &lsquo;But, (said I,) Johnson is the Hercules who strangled serpents in his cradle.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I dined with Dr. Johnson at General Paoli&rsquo;s. He was obliged, by indisposition, to leave the company early; he appointed me, however, to meet him in the evening at Mr. (now Sir Robert) Chambers&rsquo;s in the Temple, where he accordingly came, though he continued to be very ill. Chambers, as is common on such occasions, prescribed various remedies to him. JOHNSON. (fretted by pain,) &lsquo;Pr&rsquo;ythee don&rsquo;t tease me. Stay till I am well, and then you shall tell me how to cure myself.&rsquo; He grew better, and talked with a noble enthusiasm of keeping up the representation of respectable families. His zeal on this subject was a circumstance in his character exceedingly remarkable, when it is considered that he himself had no pretensions to blood. I heard him once say, &lsquo;I have great merit in being zealous for subordination and the honours of birth; for I can hardly tell who was my grandfather.&rsquo; He maintained the dignity and propriety of male succession, in opposition to the opinion of one of our friends, who had that day employed Mr. Chambers to draw his will, devising his estate to his three sisters, in preference to a remote heir male. Johnson called them &lsquo;three <span class="t8">dowdies</span>,&rsquo; and said, with as high a spirit as the boldest Baron in the most perfect days of the feudal system, &lsquo;An ancient estate should always go to males. It is mighty foolish to let a stranger have it because he marries your daughter, and takes your name. As for an estate newly acquired by trade, you may give it, if you will, to the dog <span class="t8">Towser</span>, and let him keep his <span class="t8">own</span> name.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I have known him at times exceedingly diverted at what seemed to others a very small sport. He now laughed immoderately, without any reason that we could perceive, at our friend&rsquo;s making his will; called him the <span class="t8">testator</span>, and added, &lsquo;I dare say, he thinks he has done a mighty thing. He won&rsquo;t stay till he gets home to his seat in the country, to produce this wonderful deed: he&rsquo;ll call up the landlord of the first inn on the road; and, after a suitable preface upon mortality and the uncertainty of life, will tell him that he should not delay making his will; and here, Sir, will he say, is my will, which I have just made, with the assistance of one of the ablest lawyers in the kingdom; and he will read it to him (laughing all the time). He believes he has made this will; but he did not make it: you, Chambers, made it for him. I trust you have had more conscience than to make him say, &ldquo;being of sound understanding;&rdquo; ha, ha, ha! I hope he has left me a legacy. I&rsquo;d have his will turned into verse, like a ballad.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">In this playful manner did he run on, exulting in his own pleasantry, which certainly was not such as might be expected from the authour of <span class="t8">The Rambler</span>, but which is here preserved, that my readers may be acquainted even with the slightest occasional characteristicks of so eminent a man.</p>
<p class="p24">Mr. Chambers did not by any means relish this jocularity upon a matter of which <span class="t8">pars magna fuit</span>, and seemed impatient till he got rid of us. Johnson could not stop his merriment, but continued it all the way till we got without the Temple-gate. He then burst into such a fit of laughter, that he appeared to be almost in a convulsion; and, in order to support himself, laid hold of one of the posts at the side of the foot pavement, and sent forth peals so loud, that in the silence of the night his voice seemed to resound from Temple-bar to Fleet-ditch.</p>
<p class="p24">This most ludicrous exhibition of the aweful, melancholy, and venerable Johnson, happened well to counteract the feelings of sadness which I used to experience when parting with him for a considerable time. I accompanied him to his door, where he gave me his blessing.</p>
<p class="p24">He records of himself this year, &lsquo;Between Easter and Whitsuntide, having always considered that time as propitious to study, I attempted to learn the Low Dutch language.&rsquo; It is to be observed, that he here admits an opinion of the human mind being influenced by seasons, which he ridicules in his writings. His progress, he says, was interrupted by a fever, &lsquo;which, by the imprudent use of a small print, left an inflammation in his useful eye.&rsquo; We cannot but admire his spirit when we know, that amidst a complication of bodily and mental distress, he was still animated with the desire of intellectual improvement. Various notes of his studies appear on different days, in his manuscript diary of this year, such as,</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;Inchoavi lectionem Pentateuchi &mdash; Finivi lectionem Conf. Fab.<br/>Burdonum. &mdash; Legi primum actum Troadum. &mdash; Legi Dissertationem Clerici<br/>postremam de Pent. &mdash; 2 of Clark&rsquo;s Sermons. &mdash; L. Appolonii pugnam<br/>Betriciam. &mdash; L. centum versus Homeri.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Let this serve as a specimen of what accessions of literature he was perpetually infusing into his mind, while he charged himself with idleness.</p>
<p class="p24">This year died Mrs. Salusbury, (mother of Mrs. Thrale,) a lady whom he appears to have esteemed much, and whose memory he honoured with an Epitaph.</p>
<p class="p24">In a letter from Edinburgh, dated the 29th of May, I pressed him to persevere in his resolution to make this year the projected visit to the Hebrides, of which he and I had talked for many years, and which I was confident would afford us much entertainment.</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">&lsquo;TO JAMES BOSWELL, ESQ.</span></p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;When your letter came to me, I was so darkened by an inflammation in my eye, that I could not for some time read it. I can now write without trouble, and can read large prints. My eye is gradually growing stronger; and I hope will be able to take some delight in the survey of a Caledonian loch.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Chambers is going a Judge, with six thousand a year, to Bengal. He and I shall come down together as far as Newcastle, and thence I shall easily get to Edinburgh. Let me know the exact time when your Courts intermit. I must conform a little to Chambers&rsquo;s occasions, and he must conform a little to mine. The time which you shall fix, must be the common point to which we will come as near as we can. Except this eye, I am very well.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Beattie is so caressed, and invited, and treated, and liked, and flattered, by the great, that I can see nothing of him. I am in great hope that he will be well provided for, and then we will live upon him at the Marischal College, without pity or modesty.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo; &mdash;&mdash; left the town without taking leave of me, and is gone in deep dudgeon to &mdash;&mdash; . Is not this very childish? Where is now my legacy?</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I hope your dear lady and her dear baby are both well. I shall see them too when I come; and I have that opinion of your choice, as to suspect that when I have seen Mrs. Boswell, I shall be less willing to go away. I am, dear Sir,</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;Your affectionate humble servant,<br/>&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Johnson&rsquo;s-court, Fleet-street,</p>
<p class="p24">July 5, 1773.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Write to me as soon as you can. Chambers is now at Oxford.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I again wrote to him, informing him that the Court of Session rose on the twelfth of August, hoping to see him before that time, and expressing perhaps in too extravagant terms, my admiration of him, and my expectation of pleasure from our intended tour.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To JAMES BOSWELL, ESQ.</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I shall set out from London on Friday the sixth&nbsp; of this month, and purpose not to loiter much by the way. Which day I shall be at Edinburgh, I cannot exactly tell. I suppose I must drive to an inn, and send a porter to find you.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am afraid Beattie will not be at his College soon enough for us, and I shall be sorry to miss him; but there is no staying for the concurrence of all conveniences. We will do as well as we can.</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;I am, Sir,<br/>&lsquo;Your most humble servant,<br/>&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;August 3, 1773.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">TO THE SAME.</span></p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Not being at Mr. Thrale&rsquo;s when your letter came, I had written the enclosed paper and sealed it; bringing it hither for a frank, I found yours. If any thing could repress my ardour, it would be such a letter as yours. To disappoint a friend is unpleasing; and he that forms expectations like yours, must be disappointed. Think only when you see me, that you see a man who loves you, and is proud and glad that you love him.</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;I am, Sir,<br/>&lsquo;Your most affectionate<br/>&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;August 3, 1773.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p26">TO THE SAME.<br/>&lsquo;Newcastle, Aug. 11, 1771.</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I came hither last night, and hope, but do not absolutely promise, to be in Edinburgh on Saturday. Beattie will not come so soon.</p>
<p class="p26">I am, Sir,<br/>&lsquo;Your most humble servant,<br/>&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;My compliments to your lady.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">TO THE SAME.</span></p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;Mr. Johnson sends his compliments to Mr. Boswell, being just arrived at<br/>Boyd&rsquo;s,&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Saturday night.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">His stay in Scotland was from the 18th of August, on which day he arrived, till the 22nd of November, when he set out on his return to London; and I believe ninety-four days were never passed by any man in a more vigorous exertion.</p>
<p class="p24">He came by the way of Berwick upon Tweed to Edinburgh, where he remained a few days, and then went by St. Andrew&rsquo;s, Aberdeen, Inverness, and Fort Augustus, to the Hebrides, to visit which was the principal object he had in view. He visited the isles of Sky, Rasay, Col, Mull, Inchkenneth, and Icolmkill. He travelled through Argyleshire by Inverary, and from thence by Lochlomond and Dumbarton to Glasgow, then by Loudon to Auchinleck in Ayrshire, the seat of my family, and then by Hamilton, back to Edinburgh, where he again spent some time. He thus saw the four Universities of Scotland, its three principal cities, and as much of the Highland and insular life as was sufficient for his philosophical contemplation. I had the pleasure of accompanying him during the whole of this journey. He was respectfully entertained by the great, the learned, and the elegant, wherever he went; nor was he less delighted with the hospitality which he experienced in humbler life.</p>
<p class="p24">His various adventures, and the force and vivacity of his mind, as exercised during this peregrination, upon innumerable topicks, have been faithfully, and to the best of my abilities, displayed in my <span class="t8">Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides</span>, to which, as the publick has been pleased to honour it by a very extensive circulation, I beg leave to refer, as to a separate and remarkable portion of his life, which may be there seen in detail, and which exhibits as striking a view of his powers in conversation, as his works do of his excellence in writing. Nor can I deny to myself the very flattering gratification of inserting here the character which my friend Mr. Courtenay has been pleased to give of that work:</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;With Reynolds&rsquo; pencil, vivid, bold, and true,<br/>So fervent Boswell gives him to our view:<br/>In every trait we see his mind expand;<br/>The master rises by the pupil&rsquo;s hand;<br/>We love the writer, praise his happy vein,<br/>Grac&rsquo;d with the naiveté of the sage Montaigne.<br/>Hence not alone are brighter parts display&rsquo;d,<br/>But e&rsquo;en the specks of character pourtray&rsquo;d:<br/>We <span class="t8">see</span> the Rambler with fastidious smile<br/>Mark the lone tree, and note the heath-clad isle;<br/>But when th&rsquo; heroick tale of Flora&rsquo;s charms,<br/>Deck&rsquo;d in a kilt, he wields a chieftain&rsquo;s arms:<br/>The tuneful piper sounds a martial strain,<br/>And Samuel sings, &ldquo;The King shall have his <span class="t8">ain</span>.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">During his stay at Edinburgh, after his return from the Hebrides, he was at great pains to obtain information concerning Scotland; and it will appear from his subsequent letters, that he was not less solicitous for intelligence on this subject after his return to London.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To JAMES BOSWELL, ESQ.</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I came home last night, without any incommodity, danger, or weariness, and am ready to begin a new journey. I shall go to Oxford on Monday. I know Mrs. Boswell wished me well to go; her wishes have not been disappointed. Mrs. Williams has received Sir A&rsquo;s letter.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Make my compliments to all those to whom my compliments may be welcome.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Let the box be sent as soon as it can, and let me know when to expect it.</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;Enquire, if you can, the order of the Clans: Macdonald is first,<br/>Maclean second; further I cannot go. Quicken Dr. Webster.</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;I am, Sir,<br/>&lsquo;Yours affectionately,<br/>&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Nov. 27, 1773.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">&lsquo;MR. BOSWELL TO DR. JOHNSON.</span></p>
<p class="p21">&lsquo;Edinburgh, Dec. 2, 1773.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;You shall have what information I can procure as to the order of the Clans. A gentleman of the name of Grant tells me, that there is no settled order among them; and he says, that the Macdonalds were not placed upon the right of the army at Culloden; the Stuarts were. I shall, however, examine witnesses of every name that I can find here. Dr. Webster shall be quickened too. I like your little memorandums; they are symptoms of your being in earnest with your book of northern travels.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your box shall be sent next week by sea. You will find in it some pieces of the broom bush, which you saw growing on the old castle of Auchinleck. The wood has a curious appearance when sawn across. You may either have a little writing-stand made of it, or get it formed into boards for a treatise on witchcraft, by way of a suitable binding.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p10">* * * * *</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;MR. BOSWELL TO DR. JOHNSON.<br/>&lsquo;Edinburgh, Dec. 18, 1773.</p>
<p class="p10">* * * * *</p>
<p class="p21">&lsquo;You promised me an inscription for a print to be taken from an historical picture of Mary Queen of Scots being forced to resign her crown, which Mr. Hamilton at Rome has painted for me. The two following have been sent to me:</p>
<p class="p24">&ldquo;<span class="t8">Maria Scotorum Regina meliori seculo digna, jus regiitm civibus seditiosis invita resignat</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&ldquo;<span class="t8">Cives seditiosi Mariam Scotorum Reginam sese muneri abdicare invitam cogunt</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Be so good as to read the passage in Robertson, and see if you cannot give me a better inscription. I must have it both in Latin and English; so if you should not give me another Latin one, you will at least choose the best of these two, and send a translation of it.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p10">* * * * *</p>
<p class="p21">His humane forgiving disposition was put to a pretty strong test on his return to London, by a liberty which Mr. Thomas Davies had taken with him in his absence, which was, to publish two volumes, entitled, <span class="t8">Miscellaneous and fugitive Pieces</span>, which he advertised in the news-papers, &lsquo;By the Authour of the Rambler.&rsquo; In this collection, several of Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s acknowledged writings, several of his anonymous performances, and some which he had written for others, were inserted; but there were also some in which he had no concern whatever. He was at first very angry, as he had good reason to be. But, upon consideration of his poor friend&rsquo;s narrow circumstances, and that he had only a little profit in view, and meant no harm, he soon relented, and continued his kindness to him as formerly.</p>
<p class="p24">In the course of his self-examination with retrospect to this year, he seems to have been much dejected; for he says, January 1, 1774, &lsquo;This year has passed with so little improvement, that I doubt whether I have not rather impaired than increased my learning&rsquo;; and yet we have seen how he <span class="t8">read</span>, and we know how he <span class="t8">talked</span> during that period.</p>
<p class="p24">He was now seriously engaged in writing an account of our travels in the Hebrides, in consequence of which I had the pleasure of a more frequent correspondence with him.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To JAMES BOSWELL, ESQ.</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;My operations have been hindered by a cough; at least I flatter myself,<br/>that if my cough had not come, I should have been further advanced. But<br/>I have had no intelligence from Dr. W &mdash;&mdash; , [Webster,] nor from the<br/>Excise-office, nor from you. No account of the little borough.<br/>Nothing of the Erse language. I have yet heard nothing of my box.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;You must make haste and gather me all you can, and do it quickly, or I will and shall do without it.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Make my compliments to Mrs. Boswell, and tell her that I do not love her the less for wishing me away. I gave her trouble enough, and shall be glad, in recompense, to give her any pleasure.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I would send some porter into the Hebrides, if I knew which way it could be got to my kind friends there. Enquire, and let me know.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Make my compliments to all the Doctors of Edinburgh, and to all my friends, from one end of Scotland to the other.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Write to me, and send me what intelligence you can: and if any thing is too bulky for the post, let me have it by the carrier. I do not like trusting winds and waves.</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;I am, dear Sir,<br/>&lsquo;Your most, &amp;c.<br/>&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Jan. 29, 1774.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">To THE SAME.</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;In a day or two after I had written the last discontented letter, I received my box, which was very welcome. But still I must entreat you to hasten Dr. Webster, and continue to pick up what you can that may be useful.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Mr. Oglethorpe was with me this morning, you know his errand. He was not unwelcome.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Tell Mrs. Boswell that my good intentions towards her still continue I should be glad to do any thing that would either benefit or please her.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Chambers is not yet gone, but so hurried, or so negligent, or so proud, that I rarely see him. I have, indeed, for some weeks past, been very ill of a cold and cough, and have been at Mrs. Thrale&rsquo;s, that I might be taken care of. I am much better: <span class="t8">novae redeunt in praelia vires</span>; but I am yet tender, and easily disordered. How happy it was that neither of us were ill in the Hebrides.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The question of Literary Property is this day before the Lords. Murphy drew up the Appellants&rsquo; case, that is, the plea against the perpetual right. I have not seen it, nor heard the decision. I would not have the right perpetual.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I will write to you as any thing occurs, and do you send me something about my Scottish friends. I have very great kindness for them. Let me know likewise how fees come in, and when we are to see you.</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;I am. Sir,<br/>Yours affectionately,<br/>SAM. JOHNSON.<br/>London, Feb. 7, 1774.</p>
<p class="p24">He at this time wrote the following letters to Mr. Steevens, his able associate in editing Shakspeare:</p>
<p class="p24">To George Steevens, Esq., in Hampstead.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;If I am asked when I have seen Mr. Steevens, you know what answer I must give; if I am asked when I shall see him, I wish you would tell me what to say.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;If you have Lesley&rsquo;s <span class="t8">History of Scotland</span>, or any other book about Scotland, except Boetius and Buchanan, it will be a kindness if you send them to, Sir,</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;Your humble servant,<br/>&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.<br/>&lsquo;Feb. 7, 1774.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">To the same.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;We are thinking to augment our club, and I am desirous of nominating you, if you care to stand the ballot, and can attend on Friday nights at least twice in five weeks: less than this is too little, and rather more will be expected. Be pleased to let me know before Friday.</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;I am, Sir,<br/>&lsquo;Your most, &amp;c.,<br/>&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.<br/>&lsquo;Feb. 21, 1774.</p>

<p class="p24">&lsquo;Last night you became a member of the club; if you call on me on Friday, I will introduce you. A gentleman, proposed after you, was rejected.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I thank you for <span class="t8">Neander</span>, but wish he were not so fine. I will take care of him.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am, Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your humble servant,</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;March 5, 1774.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To JAMES BOSWELL, ESQ.</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Dr. Webster&rsquo;s informations were much less exact and much less determinate than I expected: they are, indeed, much less positive than, if he can trust his own book which he laid before me, he is able to give. But I believe it will always be found, that he who calls much for information will advance his work but slowly.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am, however, obliged to you, dear Sir, for your endeavours to help me, and hope, that between us something will some time be done, if not on this, on some occasion.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Chambers is either married, or almost married, to Miss Wilton, a girl of sixteen, exquisitely beautiful, whom he has, with his lawyer&rsquo;s tongue, persuaded to take her chance with him in the East.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;We have added to the club, Charles Fox, Sir Charles Bunbury , Dr. Fordyce, and Mr. Steevens.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Return my thanks to Dr. Webster. Tell Dr. Robertson I have not much to reply to his censure of my negligence; and tell Dr. Blair, that since he has written hither what I said to him, we must now consider ourselves as even, forgive one another, and begin again. I care not how soon, for he is a very pleasing man. Pay my compliments to all my friends, and remind Lord Elibank of his promise to give me all his works.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I hope Mrs. Boswell and little Miss are well. &mdash; When shall I see them again? She is a sweet lady, only she was so glad to see me go, that I have almost a mind to come again, that she may again have the same pleasure.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Enquire if it be practicable to send a small present of a cask of porter to Dunvegan, Rasay, and Col. I would not wish to be thought forgetful of civilities.</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;I am, Sir,<br/>&lsquo;Your humble servant,<br/>&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;March 5, 1774.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On the 5th of March I wrote to him, requesting his counsel whether I should this spring come to London. I stated to him on the one hand some pecuniary embarrassments, which, together with my wife&rsquo;s situation at that time, made me hesitate; and, on the other, the pleasure and improvement which my annual visit to the metropolis always afforded me; and particularly mentioned a peculiar satisfaction which I experienced in celebrating the festival of Easter in St. Paul&rsquo;s cathedral; that to my fancy it appeared like going up to Jerusalem at the feast of the Passover; and that the strong devotion which I felt on that occasion diffused its influence on my mind through the rest of the year.</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;To JAMES BOSWELL, ESQ.<br/>[Not dated, but written about the 15th of March.]</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am ashamed to think that since I received your letter I have passed so many days without answering it.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I think there is no great difficulty in resolving your doubts. The reasons for which you are inclined to visit London, are, I think, not of sufficient strength to answer the objections. That you should delight to come once a year to the fountain of intelligence and pleasure, is very natural; but both information and pleasure must be regulated by propriety. Pleasure, which cannot be obtained but by unseasonable or unsuitable expence, must always end in pain; and pleasure, which must be enjoyed at the expence of another&rsquo;s pain, can never be such as a worthy mind can fully delight in.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;What improvement you might gain by coming to London, you may easily supply, or easily compensate, by enjoining yourself some particular study at home, or opening some new avenue to information. Edinburgh is not yet exhausted; and I am sure you will find no pleasure here which can deserve either that you should anticipate any part of your future fortune, or that you should condemn yourself and your lady to penurious frugality for the rest of the year.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I need not tell you what regard you owe to Mrs. Boswell&rsquo;s entreaties; or how much you ought to study the happiness of her who studies yours with so much diligence, and of whose kindness you enjoy such good effects. Life cannot subsist in society but by reciprocal concessions. She permitted you to ramble last year, you must permit her now to keep you at home.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your last reason is so serious, that I am unwilling to oppose it. Yet you must remember, that your image of worshipping once a year in a certain place, in imitation of the Jews, is but a comparison; and <span class="t8">simile non est idem</span>; if the annual resort to Jerusalem was a duty to the Jews, it was a duty because it was commanded; and you have no such command, therefore no such duty. It may be dangerous to receive too readily, and indulge too fondly, opinions, from which, perhaps, no pious mind is wholly disengaged, of local sanctity and local devotion. You know what strange effects they have produced over a great part of the Christian world. I am now writing, and you, when you read this, are reading under the Eye of Omnipresence.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To what degree fancy is to be admitted into religious offices, it would require much deliberation to determine. I am far from intending totally to exclude it. Fancy is a faculty bestowed by our Creator, and it is reasonable that all His gifts should be used to His glory, that all our faculties should co-operate in His worship; but they are to co-operate according to the will of Him that gave them, according to the order which His wisdom has established. As ceremonies prudential or convenient are less obligatory than positive ordinances, as bodily worship is only the token to others or ourselves of mental adoration, so Fancy is always to act in subordination to Reason. We may take Fancy for a companion, but must follow Reason as our guide. We may allow Fancy to suggest certain ideas in certain places; but Reason must always be heard, when she tells us, that those ideas and those places have no natural or necessary relation. When we enter a church we habitually recall to mind the duty of adoration, but we must not omit adoration for want of a temple; because we know, and ought to remember, that the Universal Lord is every where present; and that, therefore, to come to Jona, or to Jerusalem, though it may be useful, cannot be necessary.</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;Thus I have answered your letter, and have not answered it negligently.<br/>I love you too well to be careless when you are serious.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I think I shall be very diligent next week about our travels, which I have too long neglected.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am, dear Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your most, &amp;c.,</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Compliments to Madam and Miss.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">To The Same.</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The lady who delivers this has a lawsuit, in which she desires to make use of your skill and eloquence, and she seems to think that she shall have something more of both for a recommendation from me; which, though I know how little you want any external incitement to your duty, I could not refuse her, because I know that at least it will not hurt her, to tell you that I wish her well.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am, Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your most humble servant,</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;May 10, 1774.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">&lsquo;MR, BOSWELL TO DR. JOHNSON.</span></p>
<p class="p21">&lsquo;Edinburgh, May 12, 1774.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Lord Hailes has begged of me to offer you his best respects, and to transmit to you specimens of <span class="t8">Annals of Scotland, from the Accession of Malcolm Kenmore to the Death of James V</span>,&rsquo; in drawing up which, his Lordship has been engaged for some time. His Lordship writes to me thus: &ldquo;If I could procure Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s criticisms, they would be of great use to me in the prosecution of my work, as they would be judicious and true. I have no right to ask that favour of him. If you could, it would highly oblige me.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Dr. Blair requests you may be assured that he did not write to London what you said to him, and that neither by word nor letter has he made the least complaint of you; but, on the contrary, has a high respect for you, and loves you much more since he saw you in Scotland. It would both divert and please you to see his eagerness about this matter.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To JAMES BOSWELL, ESQ.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Streatham, June 21, 1774.</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Yesterday I put the first sheets of the <span class="t8">Journey to the Hebrides</span> to the press. I have endeavoured to do you some justice in the first paragraph. It will be one volume in octavo, not thick.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;It will be proper to make some presents in Scotland. You shall tell me to whom I shall give; and I have stipulated twenty-five for you to give in your own name. Some will take the present better from me, others better from you. In this, you who are to live in the place ought to direct. Consider it. Whatever you can get for my purpose send me; and make my compliments to your lady and both the young ones.</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;I am, Sir, your, &amp;c.,<br/>&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">&lsquo;MR. BOSWELL TO DR. JOHNSON.</span></p>
<p class="p21">&lsquo;Edinburgh, June 24, 1774.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;You do not acknowledge the receipt of the various packets which I have sent to you. Neither can I prevail with you to <span class="t8">answer</span> my letters, though you honour me with <span class="t8">returns</span>. You have said nothing to me about poor Goldsmith, nothing about Langton.</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;I have received for you, from the Society for propagating Christian<br/>Knowledge in Scotland, the following Erse books: &mdash; <span class="t8">The New Testament;<br/>Baxter&rsquo;s Call; The Confession of Faith of the Assembly of Divines at<br/>Westminster; The Mother&rsquo;s Catechism; A Gaelick and English<br/>Vocabulary</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To JAMES BOSWELL, ESQ.</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I wish you could have looked over my book before the printer, but it could not easily be. I suspect some mistakes; but as I deal, perhaps, more in notions than in facts, the matter is not great, and the second edition will be mended, if any such there be. The press will go on slowly for a time, because I am going into Wales to-morrow.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I should be very sorry if I appeared to treat such a character as Lord Hailes otherwise than with high respect. I return the sheets, to which I have done what mischief I could; and finding it so little, thought not much of sending them. The narrative is clear, lively, and short.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I have done worse to Lord Hailes than by neglecting his sheets: I have run him in debt. Dr. Horne, the President of Magdalen College in Oxford, wrote to me about three months ago, that he purposed to reprint <span class="t8">Walton&rsquo;s Lives</span>, and desired me to contribute to the work: my answer was, that Lord Hailes intended the same publication; and Dr. Home has resigned it to him. His Lordship must now think seriously about it.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Of poor dear Dr. Goldsmith there is little to be told, more than the papers have made publick. He died of a fever, made, I am afraid, more violent by uneasiness of mind. His debts began to be heavy, and all his resources were exhausted. Sir Joshua is of opinion that he owed not less than two thousand pounds. Was ever poet so trusted before?</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;You may, if you please, put the inscription thus: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&ldquo;<span class="t8">Maria Scotorum Regina nata</span> 15 &mdash; , <span class="t8">a suis in exilium acta</span> 15 &mdash; , <span class="t8">ab hospitá neci data</span> 15 &mdash; .&rdquo; You must find the years.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Of your second daughter you certainly gave the account yourself, though you have forgotten it. While Mrs. Boswell is well, never doubt of a boy. Mrs. Thrale brought, I think, five girls running, but while I was with you she had a boy.</p>
