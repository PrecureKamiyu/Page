<p class="p10">IN IMITATION OF</p>
<p class="p10">THE TENTH SATIRE OF JUVENAL.</p>
<p class="p26">Let observation, with extensive view,<br/>Survey mankind, from China to Peru;<br/>Remark each anxious toil, each eager strife,<br/>And watch the busy scenes of crowded life;<br/>Then say, how hope and fear, desire and hate<br/>O&rsquo;erspread with snares the clouded maze of fate,<br/>Where wav&rsquo;ring man, betray&rsquo;d by vent&rsquo;rous pride<br/>To tread the dreary paths, without a guide,<br/>As treach&rsquo;rous phantoms in the mist delude,<br/>Shuns fancied ills, or chases airy good;<br/>How rarely reason guides the stubborn choice,<br/>Rules the bold hand, or prompts the suppliant voice.<br/>How nations sink, by darling schemes oppress&rsquo;d,<br/>When vengeance listens to the fool&rsquo;s request.<br/>Fate wings with ev&rsquo;ry wish th&rsquo; afflictive dart,<br/>Each gift of nature, and each grace of art;<br/>With fatal heat impetuous courage glows,<br/>With fatal sweetness elocution flows,<br/>Impeachment stops the speaker&rsquo;s pow&rsquo;rful breath,<br/>And restless fire precipitates on death.<br/>But, scarce observ&rsquo;d, the knowing and the bold<br/>Fall in the gen&rsquo;ral massacre of gold;<br/>Wide wasting pest! that rages unconfin&rsquo;d,<br/>And crowds with crimes the records of mankind;<br/>For gold his sword the hireling ruffian draws,<br/>For gold the hireling judge distorts the laws;<br/>Wealth heap&rsquo;d on wealth, nor truth nor safety buys,<br/>The dangers gather as the treasures rise.<br/>Let hist&rsquo;ry tell where rival kings command,<br/>And dubious title shakes the madded land,<br/>When statutes glean the refuse of the sword,<br/>How much more safe the vassal than the lord;<br/>Low sculks the hind beneath the rage of power,<br/>And leaves the wealthy traitor in the Tower,<br/>Untouch&rsquo;d his cottage, and his slumbers sound,<br/>Though confiscation&rsquo;s vultures hover round.<br/>The needy traveller, serene and gay,<br/>Walks the wild heath, and sings his toil away.<br/>Does envy seize thee? crush th&rsquo; upbraiding joy;<br/>Increase his riches, and his peace destroy;<br/>Now fears, in dire vicissitude, invade,<br/>The rustling brake alarms, and quiv&rsquo;ring shade;<br/>Nor light nor darkness bring his pain relief,<br/>One shows the plunder, and one hides the thief.<br/>&nbsp;Yet still one gen&rsquo;ral cry the skies assails,<br/>And gain and grandeur load the tainted gales:<br/>Few know the toiling statesman&rsquo;s fear or care,<br/>Th&rsquo; insidious rival, and the gaping heir.<br/>Once more, Democritus, arise on earth,<br/>With cheerful wisdom and instructive mirth,<br/>See motley life in modern trappings dress&rsquo;d,<br/>And feed with varied fools th&rsquo; eternal jest:<br/>Thou, who could&rsquo;st laugh where want enchain&rsquo;d caprice,<br/>Toil crush&rsquo;d conceit, and man was of a piece;<br/>Where wealth, unlov&rsquo;d, without a mourner died;<br/>And scarce a sycophant was fed by pride;<br/>Where ne&rsquo;er was known the form of mock debate,<br/>Or seen a new-made mayor&rsquo;s unwieldy state;<br/>Where change of fav&rsquo;rites made no change of laws,<br/>And senates heard, before they judg&rsquo;d a cause;<br/>How would&rsquo;st thou shake at Britain&rsquo;s modish tribe,<br/>Dart the quick taunt, and edge the piercing gibe?<br/>Attentive truth and nature to descry,<br/>And pierce each scene with philosophick eye;<br/>To thee were solemn toys, or empty show,<br/>The robes of pleasure, and the veils of woe:<br/>All aid the farce, and all thy mirth maintain,<br/>Whose joys are causeless, or whose griefs are vain.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Such was the scorn that fill&rsquo;d the sage&rsquo;s mind,<br/>Renew&rsquo;d at ev&rsquo;ry glance on human kind;<br/>How just that scorn, ere yet thy voice declare,<br/>Search ev&rsquo;ry state, and canvass ev&rsquo;ry pray&rsquo;r.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Unnumber&rsquo;d suppliants crowd preferment&rsquo;s gate,<br/>Athirst for wealth, and burning to be great;<br/>Delusive fortune hears th&rsquo; incessant call,<br/>They mount, they shine, evaporate, and fall.<br/>On ev&rsquo;ry stage the foes of peace attend,<br/>Hate dogs their flight, and insult mocks their end.<br/>Love ends with hope, the sinking statesman&rsquo;s door<br/>Pours in the morning worshipper no more;<br/>For growing names the weekly scribbler lies,<br/>To growing wealth the dedicator flies;<br/>From ev&rsquo;ry room descends the painted face,<br/>That hung the bright palladium of the place;<br/>And, smok&rsquo;d in kitchens, or in auctions sold,<br/>To better features yields the frame of gold;<br/>For now no more we trace in ev&rsquo;ry line<br/>Heroick worth, benevolence divine:<br/>The form, distorted, justifies the fall,<br/>And detestation rids th&rsquo; indignant wall.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;But will not Britain hear the last appeal,<br/>Sign her foes&rsquo; doom, or guard her fav&rsquo;rites&rsquo; zeal?<br/>Through freedom&rsquo;s sons no more remonstrance rings,<br/>Degrading nobles and controling kings;<br/>Our supple tribes repress their patriot throats,<br/>And ask no questions but the price of votes;<br/>With weekly libels and septennial ale,<br/>Their wish is full to riot and to rail.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;In full-blown dignity, see Wolsey stand,<br/>Law in his voice, and fortune in his hand;<br/>To him the church, the realm their pow&rsquo;rs consign,<br/>Through him the rays of regal bounty shine;<br/>Turn&rsquo;d by his nod the stream of honour flows,<br/>His smile alone security bestows.<br/>Still to new heights his restless wishes tow&rsquo;r,<br/>Claim leads to claim, and pow&rsquo;r advances pow&rsquo;r;<br/>Till conquest, unresisted, ceas&rsquo;d to please,<br/>And rights, submitted, left him none to seize.<br/>At length his sov&rsquo;reign frowns &mdash; the train of state<br/>Mark the keen glance, and watch the sign to hate.<br/>Where&rsquo;er he turns, he meets a stranger&rsquo;s eye,<br/>His suppliants scorn him, and his followers fly;<br/>Now drops, at once, the pride of awful state,<br/>The golden canopy, the glitt&rsquo;ring plate,<br/>The regal palace, the luxurious board,<br/>The liv&rsquo;ried army, and the menial lord.<br/>With age, with cares, with maladies oppress&rsquo;d,<br/>He seeks the refuge of monastick rest:<br/>Grief aids disease, remember&rsquo;d folly stings,<br/>And his last sighs reproach the faith of kings.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Speak thou, whose thoughts at humble peace repine,<br/>Shall Wolsey&rsquo;s wealth, with Wolsey&rsquo;s end, be thine?<br/>Or liv&rsquo;st thou now, with safer pride content,<br/>The wisest justice on the banks of Trent?<br/>For, why did Wolsey, near the steeps of fate,<br/>On weak foundations raise th&rsquo; enormous weight?<br/>Why but to sink beneath misfortune&rsquo;s blow,<br/>With louder ruin to the gulfs below?<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;What gave great Villiers to th&rsquo; assassin&rsquo;s knife,<br/>And fix&rsquo;d disease on Harley&rsquo;s closing life?<br/>What murder&rsquo;d Wentworth, and what exil&rsquo;d Hyde,<br/>By kings protected, and to kings allied?<br/>What but their wish indulg&rsquo;d in courts to shine,<br/>And pow&rsquo;r too great to keep, or to resign?<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;When first the college rolls receive his name,<br/>The young enthusiast quits his ease for fame;<br/>&nbsp;Through all his veins the fever of renown<br/>Spreads from the strong contagion of the gown;<br/>O&rsquo;er Bodley&rsquo;s dome his future labours spread,<br/>And Bacon&rsquo;s mansion trembles o&rsquo;er his head.<br/>Are these thy views? Proceed, illustrious youth,<br/>And virtue guard thee to the throne of truth!<br/>Yet, should thy soul indulge the gen&rsquo;rous heat<br/>Till captive science yields her last retreat;<br/>Should reason guide thee with her brightest ray,<br/>And pour on misty doubt resistless day;<br/>Should no false kindness lure to loose delight,<br/>Nor praise relax, nor difficulty fright;<br/>Should tempting novelty thy cell refrain,<br/>And sloth effuse her opiate fumes in vain;<br/>Should beauty blunt on fops her fatal dart,<br/>Nor claim the triumph of a letter&rsquo;d heart;<br/>Should no disease thy torpid veins invade,<br/>Nor melancholy&rsquo;s phantoms haunt thy shade;<br/>Yet hope not life, from grief or danger free,<br/>Nor think the doom of man revers&rsquo;d for thee:<br/>Deign on the passing world to turn thine eyes,<br/>And pause awhile from letters, to be wise;<br/>There mark what ills the scholar&rsquo;s life assail,<br/>Toil, envy, want, the patron, and the gaol.<br/>See nations, slowly wise and meanly just,<br/>To buried merit raise the tardy bust.<br/>If dreams yet flatter, once again attend,<br/>Hear Lydiat&rsquo;s life, and Galileo&rsquo;s end.<br/>Nor deem, when learning her last prize bestows,<br/>The glitt&rsquo;ring eminence exempt from woes;<br/>See, when the vulgar scape, despis&rsquo;d or aw&rsquo;d,<br/>Rebellion&rsquo;s vengeful talons seize on Laud.<br/>From meaner minds though smaller fines content,<br/>The plunder&rsquo;d palace, or sequester&rsquo;d rent;<br/>Mark&rsquo;d out by dang&rsquo;rous parts, he meets the shock,<br/>And fatal learning leads him to the block:<br/>Around his tomb let art and genius weep,<br/>But hear his death, ye blockheads, hear and sleep.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;The festal blazes, the triumphal show,<br/>The ravish&rsquo;d standard, and the captive foe,<br/>The senate&rsquo;s thanks, the gazette&rsquo;s pompous tale,<br/>With force resistless o&rsquo;er the brave prevail.<br/>Such bribes the rapid Greek o&rsquo;er Asia whirl&rsquo;d;<br/>For such the steady Romans shook the world;<br/>For such, in distant lands, the Britons shine,<br/>And stain with blood the Danube or the Rhine;<br/>This pow&rsquo;r has praise, that virtue scarce can warm,<br/>Till fame supplies the universal charm.<br/>Yet reason frowns on war&rsquo;s unequal game,<br/>Where wasted nations raise a single name;<br/>And mortgag&rsquo;d states, their grandsires&rsquo; wreaths regret.<br/>From age to age in everlasting debt;<br/>Wreaths which, at last, the dear-bought right convey<br/>To rust on medals, or on stones decay.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;On what foundation stands the warriour&rsquo;s pride,<br/>How just his hopes, let Swedish Charles decide;<br/>A frame of adamant, a soul of fire,<br/>No dangers fright him, and no labours tire;<br/>O&rsquo;er love, o&rsquo;er fear, extends his wide domain,<br/>Unconquer&rsquo;d lord of pleasure and of pain;<br/>No joys to him pacifick sceptres yield,<br/>War sounds the trump, he rushes to the field;<br/>Behold surrounding kings their pow&rsquo;rs combine,<br/>And one capitulate, and one resign;<br/>Peace courts his hand, but spreads her charms in vain;<br/>&ldquo;Think nothing gain&rsquo;d,&rdquo; he cries, &ldquo;till nought remain,<br/>On Moscow&rsquo;s walls till Gothick standards fly,<br/>And all be mine beneath the polar sky.&rdquo;<br/>The march begins in military state,<br/>And nations on his eye suspended wait;<br/>Stern famine guards the solitary coast,<br/>And winter barricades the realm of frost;<br/>He comes, nor want nor cold his course delay; &mdash; <br/>Hide, blushing glory, hide Pultowa&rsquo;s day:<br/>The vanquish&rsquo;d hero leaves his broken bands,<br/>And shows his miseries in distant lands;<br/>Condemn&rsquo;d a needy supplicant to wait,<br/>While ladies interpose, and slaves debate.<br/>But did not chance, at length, her errour mend?<br/>Did no subverted empire mark his end?<br/>Did rival monarchs give the fatal wound?<br/>Or hostile millions press him to the ground?<br/>His fall was destin&rsquo;d to a barren strand,<br/>A petty fortress, and a dubious hand;<br/>He left the name, at which the world grew pale,<br/>To point a moral, or adorn a tale.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;All times their scenes of pompous woes afford,<br/>From Persia&rsquo;s tyrant to Bavaria&rsquo;s lord.<br/>In gay hostility and barb&rsquo;rous pride,<br/>With half mankind embattl&rsquo;d at his side,<br/>Great Xerxes comes to seize the certain prey,<br/>And starves exhausted regions in his way;<br/>Attendant flatt&rsquo;ry counts his myriads o&rsquo;er,<br/>Till counted myriads sooth his pride no more;<br/>Fresh praise is try&rsquo;d till madness fires his mind,<br/>The waves he lashes, and enchains the wind,<br/>New pow&rsquo;rs are claim&rsquo;d, new pow&rsquo;rs are still bestow&rsquo;d,<br/>Till rude resistance lops the spreading god;<br/>The daring Greeks deride the martial show,<br/>And heap their valleys with the gaudy foe;<br/>Th&rsquo; insulted sea, with humbler thoughts, he gains;<br/>A single skiff to speed his flight remains;<br/>Th&rsquo; incumber&rsquo;d oar scarce leaves the dreaded coast<br/>Through purple billows and a floating host.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;The bold Bavarian, in a luckless hour,<br/>Tries the dread summits of Caesarean pow&rsquo;r,<br/>With unexpected legions bursts away,<br/>And sees defenceless realms receive his sway; &mdash; <br/>Short sway! fair Austria spreads her mournful charms,<br/>The queen, the beauty, sets the world in arms;<br/>From hill to hill the beacon&rsquo;s rousing blaze<br/>Spreads wide the hope of plunder and of praise;<br/>The fierce Croatian, and the wild Hussar,<br/>With all the sons of ravage, crowd the war;<br/>The baffled prince, in honour&rsquo;s flatt&rsquo;ring bloom<br/>Of hasty greatness, finds the fatal doom,<br/>His foes&rsquo; derision, and his subjects&rsquo; blame,<br/>And steals to death from anguish and from shame.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Enlarge my life with multitude of days!<br/>In health, in sickness, thus the suppliant prays;<br/>Hides from himself his state, and shuns to know,<br/>That life protracted is protracted woe.<br/>Time hovers o&rsquo;er, impatient to destroy,<br/>And shuts up all the passages of joy;<br/>In vain their gifts the bounteous seasons pour,<br/>The fruit autumnal, and the vernal flow&rsquo;r;<br/>With listless eyes the dotard views the store,<br/>He views, and wonders that they please no more;<br/>Now pall the tasteless meats, and joyless wines,<br/>And luxury with sighs her slave resigns.<br/>Approach, ye minstrels, try the soothing strain,<br/>Diffuse the tuneful lenitives of pain:<br/>No sounds, alas! would touch th&rsquo; impervious ear,<br/>Though dancing mountains witness&rsquo;d Orpheus near;<br/>Nor lute nor lyre his feeble pow&rsquo;rs attend,<br/>Nor sweeter musick of a virtuous friend;<br/>But everlasting dictates crowd his tongue,<br/>Perversely grave, or positively wrong.<br/>The still returning tale, and ling&rsquo;ring jest,<br/>Perplex the fawning niece and pamper&rsquo;d guest,<br/>While growing hopes scarce awe the gath&rsquo;ring sneer,<br/>And scarce a legacy can bribe to hear;<br/>The watchful guests still hint the last offence;<br/>The daughter&rsquo;s petulance, the son&rsquo;s expense,<br/>Improve his heady rage with treach&rsquo;rous skill,<br/>And mould his passions till they make his will.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Unnumber&rsquo;d maladies his joints invade,<br/>Lay siege to life, and press the dire blockade;<br/>But unextinguish&rsquo;d av&rsquo;rice still remains,<br/>And dreaded losses aggravate his pains;<br/>He turns, with anxious heart and crippled hands,<br/>His bonds of debt, and mortgages of lands;<br/>Or views his coffers with suspicious eyes,<br/>Unlocks his gold, and counts it till he dies.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;But grant, the virtues of a temp&rsquo;rate prime<br/>Bless with an age exempt from scorn or crime;<br/>An age that melts with unperceiv&rsquo;d decay,<br/>And glides in modest innocence away;<br/>Whose peaceful day benevolence endears,<br/>Whose night congratulating conscience cheers;<br/>The gen&rsquo;ral fav&rsquo;rite as the gen&rsquo;ral friend;<br/>Such age there is, and who shall wish its end?<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet e&rsquo;en on this her load misfortune flings,<br/>To press the weary minutes&rsquo; flagging wings;<br/>New sorrow rises as the day returns,<br/>A sister sickens, or a daughter mourns.<br/>Now kindred merit fills the sable bier,<br/>Now lacerated friendship claims a tear;<br/>Year chases year, decay pursues decay,<br/>Still drops some joy from with&rsquo;ring life away;<br/>New forms arise, and diff&rsquo;rent views engage,<br/>Superfluous lags the vet&rsquo;ran on the stage,<br/>Till pitying nature signs the last release,<br/>And bids afflicted worth retire to peace.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;But few there are whom hours like these await,<br/>Who set unclouded in the gulfs of fate.<br/>From Lydia&rsquo;s monarch should the search descend,<br/>By Solon caution&rsquo;d to regard his end,<br/>In life&rsquo;s last scene what prodigies surprise,<br/>Fears of the brave, and follies of the wise!<br/>From Marlb&rsquo;rough&rsquo;s eyes the streams of dotage flow,<br/>And Swift expires a driv&rsquo;ller and a show.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;The teeming mother, anxious for her race,<br/>Begs for each birth the fortune of a face;<br/>Yet Vane could tell what ills from beauty spring;<br/>And Sedley curs&rsquo;d the form that pleas&rsquo;d a king.<br/>Ye nymphs of rosy lips and radiant eyes,<br/>Whom pleasure keeps too busy to be wise;<br/>Whom joys with soft varieties invite,<br/>By day the frolick, and the dance by night;<br/>Who frown with vanity, who smile with art,<br/>And ask the latest fashion of the heart;<br/>What care, what rules, your heedless charms shall save,<br/>Each nymph your rival, and each youth your slave?<br/>Against your fame with fondness hate combines,<br/>The rival batters, and the lover mines.<br/>With distant voice neglected virtue calls,<br/>Less heard and less, the faint remonstrance falls;<br/>Tir&rsquo;d with contempt, she quits the slipp&rsquo;ry reign,<br/>And pride and prudence take her seat in vain.<br/>In crowd at once, where none the pass defend,<br/>The harmless freedom, and the private friend.<br/>The guardians yield, by force superiour ply&rsquo;d:<br/>To int&rsquo;rest, prudence; and to flatt&rsquo;ry, pride.<br/>Here beauty falls, betray&rsquo;d, despis&rsquo;d, distress&rsquo;d,<br/>And hissing infamy proclaims the rest.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Where then shall hope and fear their objects find?<br/>Must dull suspense corrupt the stagnant mind?<br/>Must helpless man, in ignorance sedate,<br/>Roll darkling down the torrent of his fate?<br/>Must no dislike alarm, no wishes rise,<br/>No cries invoke the mercies of the skies?<br/>Inquirer, cease; petitions yet remain<br/>Which heav&rsquo;n may hear; nor deem religion vain.<br/>Still raise for good the supplicating voice,<br/>But leave to heav&rsquo;n the measure and the choice.<br/>Safe in his pow&rsquo;r, whose eyes discern afar<br/>The secret ambush of a specious pray&rsquo;r;<br/>Implore his aid, in his decisions rest,<br/>Secure, whate&rsquo;er he gives, he gives the best.<br/>Yet, when the sense of sacred presence fires,<br/>And strong devotion to the skies aspires,<br/>Pour forth thy fervours for a healthful mind,<br/>Obedient passions, and a will resign&rsquo;d;<br/>For love, which scarce collective man can fill;<br/>For patience, sov&rsquo;reign o&rsquo;er transmuted ill;<br/>For faith, that, panting for a happier seat,<br/>Counts death kind nature&rsquo;s signal of retreat:<br/>These goods for man the laws of heav&rsquo;n ordain;<br/>These goods he grants, who grants the pow&rsquo;r to gain;<br/>With these celestial wisdom calms the mind,<br/>And makes the happiness she does not find.</p>
