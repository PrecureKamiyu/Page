		   <h1>\(\bf\TeX\)</h1>
		   <p>What you should do if you want to learn TeX:</p>
		   <ol>
		   	<li>Download TeX Live on your linux machine</li>
			<li>Run <code>texdoc lshort-zh-cn</code> in your terminal</li>
			<li>Read it</li>
			<li>Write your homework with LaTeX</li>
			<li>Read the <a href="https://visualmatheditor.equatheque.net/doc/texbook.pdf" target="_blank">TeXbook</a> and 
			learn some cool things about TeX</li>
		   </ol>
		   <h2>\(\bf\TeX\text{book}\)</h2>
		   <p>\(\TeX\)book is not just about \(\TeX\). It also tells you about <strong>what is typesetting</strong>. I didn't know a thing about
		   the spacing between some certain letters like V and A (the spacing between V and A should be adjusted when VA is next to each other.) before I knew about what kerning is in \(\TeX\). 
		   </p>
		   <p>\(\TeX\) helps you 
		   build a taste that tells you which is good typesetting and which is not. Clearly enough, html is not good enough for formatting text.</p>
		   <p>Maybe it is enough for one who is interested in \(\TeX\), but there is also some great source like <a href="https://texdoc.org/serve/texbytopic/0" target="_blank"><i>TeX by Topic</i></a>. And a serial of books named <i>TeX is practice</i>.</p>
		   <h2>\(\bf\LaTeX\)</h2>
		   <p>Honestly speaking, I need more references to \(\LaTeX\). Since I have no idea about the macro, for now.</p>

		   <h2>upLaTeX</h2>
		   <p>An official <a href="http://www.t-lab.opal.ne.jp/tex/uptex_en.html" target="_blank">documentation</a> is quite useful, providing us with some example codes and output. There <em>is</em> also information about how to use 
		   jlreq documentclass in upLaTeX. 
		   So precisely, it is not reference to upLaTeX either.</p>
		   <p>ujarticle class or ujbook class are available in upLaTeX. However, you should better use jlreq class 
		   since it is more "standard". </p>
		   <p>For more information about jlreq, please read <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/jlreq/?lang=en" target="_blank">jlreq</a></p>

   		<h1> \(\bf \TeX\) in Vim</h1>
		<p>There are two plugin needed if you want to write \(\LaTeX\) in Vim. They are</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://github.com/SirVer/ultisnips" target="_blank">Ultisnips</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://github.com/lervag/vimtex" target="_blank">vimtex</a></li>
		</ul>
		<p>Ultisnips makes you enter code more efficiently. Vimtex makes vim more smart in some details about \(\LaTeX\), for example, it can tell whether you are in math mode or not and most importantly, it can compile the tex file whenever you save the file. You don't have to compile the file manually after you make some modifications.</p>
		<h2>Ultisnips</h2>
		<p>One shall learn how to write snippets for their own sake.</p>
		<p>There is already some reference to setting up ultisnips for \(\TeX\). You can check yourself. About writing snippets, you should check the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zik6u0klD40" target="_blank">videos</a> that are accessible on youtube, uploaded by the author of ultisnips. They are old but good. </p>
