<h2 class="h20"><a id="a2030"></a>EPILOGUE.</h2>
<p class="p10">BY SIR WILLIAM YONGE.</p>
<p class="p26">Marry a Turk! a haughty, tyrant king!<br/>Who thinks us women born to dress and sing<br/>To please his fancy! see no other man!<br/>Let him persuade me to it &mdash; if he can;<br/>Besides, he has fifty wives; and who can bear<br/>To have the fiftieth part, her paltry share?</p>
<p class="p26">&rsquo;Tis true, the fellow&rsquo;s handsome, straight, and tall,<br/>But how the devil should he please us all!<br/>My swain is little &mdash; true &mdash; but, be it known,<br/>My pride&rsquo;s to have that little all my own.<br/>Men will be ever to their errours blind,<br/>Where woman&rsquo;s not allow&rsquo;d to speak her mind.<br/>I swear this eastern pageantry is nonsense,<br/>And for one man &mdash; one wife&rsquo;s enough in conscience.</p>
<p class="p26">In vain proud man usurps what&rsquo;s woman&rsquo;s due;<br/>For us, alone, they honour&rsquo;s paths pursue:<br/>Inspir&rsquo;d by us, they glory&rsquo;s heights ascend;<br/>Woman the source, the object, and the end.<br/>Though wealth, and pow&rsquo;r, and glory, they receive,<br/>These are all trifles to what we can give.<br/>For us the statesman labours, hero fights,<br/>Bears toilsome days, and wakes long tedious nights;<br/>And, when blest peace has silenc&rsquo;d war&rsquo;s alarms;<br/>Receives his full reward in beauty&rsquo;s arms.</p>
