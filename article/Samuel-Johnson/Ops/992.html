<p class="p24">&lsquo;If you do not write directly, so as to catch me here, I shall be disappointed. Two lines from you will keep my lamp burning bright.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;To James Boswell, Esq.<br/>&lsquo;Dear Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Why should you importune me so earnestly to write? Of what importance can it be to hear of distant friends, to a man who finds himself welcome wherever he goes, and makes new friends faster than he can want them? If to the delight of such universal kindness of reception, any thing can be added by knowing that you retain my good-will, you may indulge yourself in the full enjoyment of that small addition.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am glad that you made the round of Lichfield with so much success: the oftener you are seen, the more you will be liked. It was pleasing to me to read that Mrs. Aston was so well, and that Lucy Porter was so glad to see you.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;In the place where you now are, there is much to be observed; and you will easily procure yourself skilful directors. But what will you do to keep away the <span class="t8">black dog</span> that worries you at home? If you would, in compliance with your father&rsquo;s advice, enquire into the old tenures and old charters of Scotland, you would certainly open to yourself many striking scenes of the manners of the middle ages. The feudal system, in a country half-barbarous, is naturally productive of great anomalies in civil life. The knowledge of past times is naturally growing less in all cases not of publick record; and the past time of Scotland is so unlike the present, that it is already difficult for a Scotchman to image the oeconomy of his grandfather. Do not be tardy nor negligent; but gather up eagerly what can yet be found.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;We have, I think, once talked of another project, a <span class="t8">History of the late insurrection in Scotland</span>, with all its incidents. Many falsehoods are passing into uncontradicted history. Voltaire, who loved a striking story, has told what he could not find to be true. </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;You may make collections for either of these projects, or for both, as opportunities occur, and digest your materials at leisure. The great direction which Burton has left to men disordered like you, is this, <span class="t8">Be not solitary; be not idle</span>: which I would thus modify; &mdash; If you are idle, be not solitary; if you are solitary, be not idle.</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;There is a letter for you, from<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rsquo;Your humble servant,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rsquo;Sam. Johnson.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;London, October 27, 1779.&rsquo;<br/>&lsquo;To Dr. Samuel Johnson.<br/>&lsquo;Carlisle, Nov. 7, 1779.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;My dear Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;That I should importune you to write to me at Chester, is not wonderful, when you consider what an avidity I have for delight; and that the <span class="t8">amor</span> of pleasure, like the <span class="t8">amor nummi</span>, increases in proportion with the quantity which we possess of it. Your letter, so full of polite kindness and masterly counsel, came like a large treasure upon me, while already glittering with riches. I was quite enchanted at Chester, so that I could with difficulty quit it. But the enchantment was the reverse of that of Circ√©; for so far was there from being any thing sensual in it, that I was <span class="t8">all mind</span>. I do not mean all reason only; for my fancy was kept finely in play. And why not? &mdash; If you please I will send you a copy, or an abridgement of my Chester journal, which is truly a log-book of felicity.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The Bishop treated me with a kindness which was very flattering. I told him, that you regretted you had seen so little of Chester. His Lordship bade me tell you, that he should be glad to shew you more of it. I am proud to find the friendship with which you honour me is known in so many places.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I arrived here late last night. Our friend the Dean has been gone from hence some months; but I am told at my inn, that he is very <span class="t8">populous</span> (popular). However, I found Mr. Law, the Archdeacon, son to the Bishop, and with him I have breakfasted and dined very agreeably. I got acquainted with him at the assizes here, about a year and a half ago; he is a man of great variety of knowledge, uncommon genius, and I believe, sincere religion. I received the holy sacrament in the Cathedral in the morning, this being the first Sunday in the month; and was at prayers there in the evening. It is divinely cheering to me to think that there is a Cathedral so near Auchinleck; and I now leave Old England in such a state of mind as I am thankful to GOD for granting me.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The <span class="t8">black dog</span> that worries me at home I cannot but dread; yet as I have been for some time past in a military train, I trust I shall <span class="t8">repulse</span> him. To hear from you will animate me like the sound of a trumpet, I therefore hope, that soon after my return to the northern field, I shall receive a few lines from you.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Colonel Stuart did me the honour to escort me in his carriage to shew me Liverpool, and from thence back again to Warrington, where we parted. In justice to my valuable wife, I must inform you she wrote to me, that as I was so happy, she would not be so selfish as to wish me to return sooner than business absolutely required my presence. She made my clerk write to me a post or two after to the same purpose, by commission from her; and this day a kind letter from her met me at the Post-Office here, acquainting me that she and the little ones were well, and expressing all their wishes for my return home. I am, more and more, my dear Sir,</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;Your affectionate<br/>&lsquo;And obliged humble servant,<br/>&lsquo;JAMES BOSWELL.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;To JAMES BOSWELL, ESQ.<br/>&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your last letter was not only kind but fond. But I wish you to get rid of all intellectual excesses, and neither to exalt your pleasures, nor aggravate your vexations, beyond their real and natural state.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Why should you not be as happy at Edinburgh as at Chester? <span class="t8">In culpa est animus, qui se non effugit usquam</span>. Please yourself with your wife and children, and studies, and practice.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I have sent a petition from Lucy Porter, with which I leave it to your discretion whether it is proper to comply. Return me her letter, which I have sent, that you may know the whole case, and not be seduced to any thing that you may afterwards repent. Miss Doxy perhaps you know to be Mr. Garrick&rsquo;s niece.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;If Dean Percy can be popular at Carlisle, he may be very happy. He has in his disposal two livings, each equal, or almost equal in value to the deanery; he may take one himself, and give the other to his son.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;How near is the Cathedral to Auchinleck, that you are so much delighted with it? It is, I suppose, at least an hundred and fifty miles off. However, if you are pleased, it is so far well.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Let me know what reception you have from your father, and the state of his health. Please him as much as you can, and add no pain to his last years.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Of our friends here I can recollect nothing to tell you. I have neither seen nor heard of Langton. Beauclerk is just returned from Brighthelmston, I am told, much better. Mr. Thrale and his family are still there; and his health is said to be visibly improved; he has not bathed, but hunted.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;At Bolt-court there is much malignity, but of late little open hostility. I have had a cold, but it is gone.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Make my compliments to Mrs. Boswell, &amp;c.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am, Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your humble servant,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;London, Nov. 13, 1779.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On November 22, and December 21, I wrote to him from Edinburgh, giving a very favourable report of the family of Miss Doxy&rsquo;s lover; &mdash; that after a good deal of enquiry I had discovered the sister of Mr. Francis Stewart, one of his amanuenses when writing his <span class="t8">Dictionary</span>; &mdash; that I had, as desired by him, paid her a guinea for an old pocket-book of her brother&rsquo;s which he had retained; and that the good woman, who was in very moderate circumstances, but contented and placid, wondered at his scrupulous and liberal honesty, and received the guinea as if sent her by Providence. &mdash; That I had repeatedly begged of him to keep his promise to send me his letter to Lord Chesterfield, and that this <span class="t8">memento</span>, like <span class="t8">Delenda est Carthago</span>, must be in every letter that I should write to him, till I had obtained my object.</p>
<p class="p24">1780: AETAT. 71. &mdash; In 1780, the world was kept in impatience for the completion of his <span class="t8">Lives of the Poets</span>, upon which he was employed so far as his indolence allowed him to labour.</p>
<p class="p24">I wrote to him on January 1, and March 13, sending him my notes of Lord Marchmont&rsquo;s information concerning Pope; &mdash; complaining that I had not heard from him for almost four months, though he was two letters in my debt; &mdash; that I had suffered again from melancholy; &mdash; hoping that he had been in so much better company, (the Poets,) that he had not time to think of his distant friends; for if that were the case, I should have some recompence for my uneasiness; &mdash; that the state of my affairs did not admit of my coming to London this year; and begging he would return me Goldsmith&rsquo;s two poems, with his lines marked.</p>
<p class="p24">His friend Dr. Lawrence having now suffered the greatest affliction to which a man is liable, and which Johnson himself had felt in the most severe manner; Johnson wrote to him in an admirable strain of sympathy and pious consolation.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To DR. LAWRENCE.</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;At a time when all your friends ought to shew their kindness, and with a character which ought to make all that know you your friends, you may wonder that you have yet heard nothing from me.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I have been hindered by a vexatious and incessant cough, for which within these ten days I have been bled once, fasted four or five times, taken physick five times, and opiates, I think, six. This day it seems to remit.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The loss, dear Sir, which you have lately suffered, I felt many years ago, and know therefore how much has been taken from you, and how little help can be had from consolation. He that outlives a wife whom he has long loved, sees himself disjoined from the only mind that has the same hopes, and fears, and interest; from the only companion with whom he has shared much good or evil; and with whom he could set his mind at liberty, to retrace the past or anticipate the future. The continuity of being is lacerated; the settled course of sentiment and action is stopped; and life stands suspended and motionless, till it is driven by external causes into a new channel. But the time of suspense is dreadful.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Our first recourse in this distressed solitude, is, perhaps for want of habitual piety, to a gloomy acquiescence in necessity. Of two mortal beings, one must lose the other; but surely there is a higher and better comfort to be drawn from the consideration of that Providence which watches over all, and a belief that the living and the dead are equally in the hands of GOD, who will reunite those whom he has separated; or who sees that it is best not to reunite.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am, dear Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your most affectionate,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;And most humble servant,</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;January 20, 1780.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To JAMES BOSWELL, ESQ.</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Well, I had resolved to send you the Chesterfield letter; but I will write once again without it. Never impose tasks upon mortals. To require two things is the way to have them both undone.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;For the difficulties which you mention in your affairs I am sorry; but difficulty is now very general: it is not therefore less grievous, for there is less hope of help. I pretend not to give you advice, not knowing the state of your affairs; and general counsels about prudence and frugality would do you little good. You are, however, in the right not to increase your own perplexity by a journey hither; and I hope that by staying at home you will please your father.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Poor dear Beauclerk &mdash; <span class="t8">nec, ut soles, dabis joca</span>. His wit and his folly, his acuteness and maliciousness, his merriment and reasoning, are now over. Such another will not often be found among mankind. He directed himself to be buried by the side of his mother, an instance of tenderness which I hardly expected. He has left his children to the care of Lady Di, and if she dies, of Mr. Langton, and of Mr. Leicester his relation, and a man of good character. His library has been offered to sale to the Russian ambassador.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Dr. Percy, notwithstanding all the noise of the newspapers, has had no literary loss. Clothes and moveables were burnt to the value of about one hundred pounds; but his papers, and I think his books, were all preserved.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Poor Mr. Thrale has been in extreme danger from an apoplectical disorder, and recovered, beyond the expectation of his physicians; he is now at Bath, that his mind may be quiet, and Mrs. Thrale and Miss are with him.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Having told you what has happened to your friends, let me say something to you of yourself. You are always complaining of melancholy, and I conclude from those complaints that you are fond of it. No man talks of that which he is desirous to conceal, and every man desires to conceal that of which he is ashamed. Do not pretend to deny it; <span class="t8">manifestum habemus furem</span>; make it an invariable and obligatory law to yourself, never to mention your own mental diseases; if you are never to speak of them, you will think on them but little, and if you think little of them, they will molest you rarely. When you talk of them, it is plain that you want either praise or pity; for praise there is no room, and pity will do you no good; therefore, from this hour speak no more, think no more, about them.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your transaction with Mrs. Stewart gave me great satisfaction; I am much obliged to you for your attention. Do not lose sight of her; your countenance may be of great credit, and of consequence of great advantage to her. The memory of her brother is yet fresh in my mind; he was an ingenious and worthy man.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Please to make my compliments to your lady, and to the young ladies. I should like to see them, pretty loves.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am, dear Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Yours affectionately,</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;April 8, 1780.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Mrs. Thrale being now at Bath with her husband, the correspondence between Johnson and her was carried on briskly. I shall present my readers with one of her original letters to him at this time, which will amuse them probably more than those well-written but studied epistles which she has inserted in her collection, because it exhibits the easy vivacity of their literary intercourse. It is also of value as a key to Johnson&rsquo;s answer, which she has printed by itself, and of which I shall subjoin extracts.</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">&lsquo;MRS. THRALE TO DR. JOHNSON.</span></p>
<p class="p21">&lsquo;I had a very kind letter from you yesterday, dear Sir, with a most circumstantial date. You took trouble with my circulating letter,&nbsp; Mr. Evans writes me word, and I thank you sincerely for so doing: one might do mischief else not being on the spot.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Yesterday&rsquo;s evening was passed at Mrs. Montagu&rsquo;s: there was Mr. Melmoth; I do not like him <span class="t8">though</span>, nor he me; it was expected we should have pleased each other; he is, however, just Tory enough to hate the Bishop of Peterborough for Whiggism, and Whig enough to abhor you for Toryism.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Mrs. Montagu flattered him finely; so he had a good afternoon on&rsquo;t. This evening we spend at a concert. Poor Queeney&rsquo;s sore eyes have just released her; she had a long confinement, and could neither read nor write, so my master treated her very good-naturedly with the visits of a young woman in this town, a taylor&rsquo;s daughter, who professes musick, and teaches so as to give six lessons a day to ladies, at five and threepence a lesson. Miss Burney says she is a great performer; and I respect the wench for getting her living so prettily; she is very modest and pretty-mannered, and not seventeen years old.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;You live in a fine whirl indeed; if I did not write regularly you would half forget me, and that would be very wrong, for I <span class="t8">felt</span> my regard for you in my <span class="t8">face</span> last night, when the criticisms were going on.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;This morning it was all connoisseurship; we went to see some pictures painted by a gentleman-artist, Mr. Taylor, of this place; my master makes one, every where, and has got a good dawling companion to ride with him now. He looks well enough, but I have no notion of health for a man whose mouth cannot be sewed up. Burney and I and Queeney teize him every meal he eats, and Mrs. Montagu is quite serious with him; but what <span class="t8">can</span> one do? He will eat, I think, and if he does eat I know he will not live; it makes me very unhappy, but I must bear it. Let me always have your friendship. I am, most sincerely, dear Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your faithful servant,</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">&lsquo;H. L. T.&rsquo;</span></p>
<p class="p21">&lsquo;Bath, Friday, April 28.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">&lsquo;DR. JOHNSON TO MRS. THRALE.</span></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">&lsquo;DEAREST MADAM,</span></p>
<p class="p21">&lsquo;Mr. Thrale never will live abstinently, till he can persuade himself to live by rule.</p>
<p class="p10">* * * * *</p>
<p class="p21">Encourage, as you can, the musical girl.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Nothing is more common than mutual dislike, where mutual approbation is particularly expected. There is often on both sides a vigilance not over-benevolent; and as attention is strongly excited, so that nothing drops unheeded, any difference in taste or opinion, and some difference where there is no restraint will commonly appear, immediately generates dislike.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Never let criticisms operate upon your face or your mind; it is very rarely that an authour is hurt by his criticks. The blaze of reputation cannot be blown out, but it often dies in the socket; a very few names may be considered as perpetual lamps that shine unconsumed. From the authour of <span class="t8">Fitzosborne&rsquo;s Letters</span> I cannot think myself in much danger. I met him only once about thirty years ago, and in some small dispute reduced him to whistle; having not seen him since, that is the last impression. Poor Moore, the fabulist, was one of the company.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Mrs. Montagu&rsquo;s long stay, against her own inclination, is very convenient. You would, by your own confession, want a companion; and she is <span class="t8">par pluribus</span>; conversing with her you may <span class="t8">find variety in one</span>.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;London, May 1, 1780.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On the and of May I wrote to him, and requested that we might have another meeting somewhere in the North of England, in the autumn of this year.</p>
<p class="p24">From Mr. Langton I received soon after this time a letter, of which I extract a passage, relative both to Mr. Beauclerk and Dr. Johnson.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The melancholy information you have received concerning Mr. Beauclerk&rsquo;s death is true. Had his talents been directed in any sufficient degree as they ought, I have always been strongly of opinion that they were calculated to make an illustrious figure; and that opinion, as it had been in part formed upon Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s judgment, receives more and more confirmation by hearing what, since his death, Dr. Johnson has said concerning them; a few evenings ago, he was at Mr. Vesey&rsquo;s, where Lord Althorpe, who was one of a numerous company there, addressed Dr. Johnson on the subject of Mr. Beauclerk&rsquo;s death, saying, &ldquo;Our CLUB has had a great loss since we met last.&rdquo; He replied, &ldquo;A loss, that perhaps the whole nation could not repair!&rdquo; The Doctor then went on to speak of his endowments, and particularly extolled the wonderful ease with which he uttered what was highly excellent. He said, that &ldquo;no man ever was so free when he was going to say a good thing, from a <span class="t8">look</span> that expressed that it was coming; or, when he had said it, from a look that expressed that it had come.&rdquo; At Mr. Thrale&rsquo;s, some days before when we were talking on the same subject, he said, referring to the same idea of his wonderful facility, &ldquo;That Beauclerk&rsquo;s talents were those which he had felt himself more disposed to envy, than those of any whom he had known.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;On the evening I have spoken of above, at Mr. Vesey&rsquo;s, you would have been much gratified, as it exhibited an instance of the high importance in which Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s character is held, I think even beyond any I ever before was witness to. The company consisted chiefly of ladies, among whom were the Duchess Dowager of Portland, the Duchess of Beaufort, whom I suppose from her rank I must name before her mother Mrs. Boscawen, and her elder sister Mrs. Lewson, who was likewise there; Lady Lucan, Lady Clermont, and others of note both for their station and understandings. Among the gentlemen were Lord Althorpe, whom I have before named, Lord Macartney, Sir Joshua Reynolds, Lord Lucan, Mr. Wraxal, whose book you have probably seen, <span class="t8">The Tour to the Northern Parts of Europe</span>; a very agreeable ingenious man; Dr. Warren, Mr. Pepys, the Master in Chancery, whom I believe you know, and Dr. Barnard, the Provost of Eton. As soon as Dr. Johnson was come in and had taken a chair, the company began to collect round him, till they became not less than four, if not five, deep; those behind standing, and listening over the heads of those that were sitting near him. The conversation for some time was chiefly between Dr. Johnson and the Provost of Eton, while the others contributed occasionally their remarks. Without attempting to detail the particulars of the conversation, which perhaps if I did, I should spin my account out to a tedious length, I thought, my dear Sir, this general account of the respect with which our valued friend was attended to, might be acceptable.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To THE REVEREND DR. FARMER.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;May 25, 1780.</p>
<p class="p24">Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I know your disposition to second any literary attempt, and therefore venture upon the liberty of entreating you to procure from College or University registers, all the dates, or other informations which they can supply, relating to Ambrose Philips, Broome, and Gray, who were all of Cambridge, and of whose lives I am to give such accounts as I can gather. Be pleased to forgive this trouble from, Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your most humble servant,</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">While Johnson was thus engaged in preparing a delightful literary entertainment for the world, the tranquillity of the metropolis of Great-Britain was unexpectedly disturbed, by the most horrid series of outrage that ever disgraced a civilised country. A relaxation of some of the severe penal provisions against our fellow-subjects of the Catholic communion had been granted by the legislature, with an opposition so inconsiderable that the genuine mildness of Christianity, united with liberal policy, seemed to have become general in this island. But a dark and malignant spirit of persecution soon shewed itself, in an unworthy petition for the repeal of the wise and humane statute. That petition was brought forward by a mob, with the evident purpose of intimidation, and was justly rejected. But the attempt was accompanied and followed by such daring violence as is unexampled in history. Of this extraordinary tumult, Dr. Johnson has given the following concise, lively, and just account in his Letters to Mrs. Thrale: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;On Friday, the good Protestants met in Saint George&rsquo;s-Fields, at the summons of Lord George Gordon, and marching to Westminster, insulted the Lords and Commons, who all bore it with great tameness. At night the outrages began by the demolition of the mass-house by Lincoln&rsquo;s-Inn.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;An exact journal of a week&rsquo;s defiance of government I cannot give you. On Monday, Mr. Strahan, who had been insulted, spoke to Lord Mansfield, who had I think been insulted too, of the licentiousness of the populace; and his Lordship treated it as a very slight irregularity. On Tuesday night they pulled down Fielding&rsquo;s house, and burnt his goods in the street. They had gutted on Monday Sir George Savile&rsquo;s house, but the building was saved. On Tuesday evening, leaving Fielding&rsquo;s ruins, they went to Newgate to demand their companions who had been seized demolishing the chapel. The keeper could not release them but by the Mayor&rsquo;s permission, which he went to ask; at his return he found all the prisoners released, and Newgate in a blaze. They then went to Bloomsbury, and fastened upon Lord Mansfield&rsquo;s house, which they pulled down; and as for his goods, they totally burnt them. They have since gone to Caen-wood, but a guard was there before them. They plundered some Papists, I think, and burnt a mass-house in Moorfields the same night.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;On Wednesday I walked with Dr. Scott to look at Newgate, and found it in ruins, with the fire yet glowing. As I went by, the Protestants were plundering the Sessions-house at the Old-Bailey. There were not, I believe, a hundred; but they did their work at leisure, in full security, without sentinels, without trepidation, as men lawfully employed, in full day. Such is the cowardice of a commercial place. On Wednesday they broke open the Fleet, and the King&rsquo;s-Bench, and the Marshalsea, and Wood-street Compter, and Clerkenwell Bridewell, and released all the prisoners.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;At night they set fire to the Fleet, and to the King&rsquo;s-Bench, and I know not how many other places; and one might see the glare of conflagration fill the sky from many parts. The sight was dreadful. Some people were threatened: Mr. Strahan advised me to take care of myself. Such a time of terrour you have been happy in not seeing.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The King said in Council, &ldquo;That the magistrates had not done their duty, but that he would do his own;&rdquo; and a proclamation was published, directing us to keep our servants within doors, as the peace was now to be preserved by force. The soldiers were sent out to different parts, and the town is now [<span class="t8">June</span> 9] at quiet.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The soldiers are stationed so as to be every where within call: there is no longer any body of rioters, and the individuals are hunted to their holes, and led to prison; Lord George was last night sent to the Tower. Mr. John Wilkes was this day in my neighbourhood, to seize the publisher of a seditious paper.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Several chapels have been destroyed, and several inoffensive Papists have been plundered; but the high sport was to burn the gaols. This was a good rabble trick. The debtors and the criminals were all set at liberty; but of the criminals, as has always happened, many are already retaken; and two pirates have surrendered themselves, and it is expected that they will be pardoned.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Government now acts again with its proper force; and we are all under the protection of the King and the law. I thought that it would be agreeable to you and my master to have my testimony to the publick security; and that you would sleep more quietly when I told you that you are safe.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;There has, indeed, been an universal panick from which the King was the first that recovered. Without the concurrence of his ministers, or the assistance of the civil magistrate, he put the soldiers in motion, and saved the town from calamities, such as a rabble&rsquo;s government must naturally produce.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The publick has escaped a very heavy calamity. The rioters attempted the Bank on Wednesday night, but in no great number; and like other thieves, with no great resolution. Jack Wilkes headed the party that drove them away. It is agreed, that if they had seized the Bank on Tuesday, at the height of the panick, when no resistance had been prepared, they might have carried irrecoverably away whatever they had found. Jack, who was always zealous for order and decency, declares that if he be trusted with power, he will not leave a rioter alive. There is, however, now no longer any need of heroism or bloodshed; no blue ribband is any longer worn.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Such was the end of this miserable sedition, from which London was delivered by the magnanimity of the Sovereign himself. Whatever some may maintain, I am satisfied that there was no combination or plan, either domestic or foreign; but that the mischief spread by a gradual contagion of frenzy, augmented by the quantities of fermented liquors, of which the deluded populace possessed themselves in the course of their depredations.</p>
<p class="p24">I should think myself very much to blame, did I here neglect to do justice to my esteemed friend Mr. Akerman, the keeper of Newgate, who long discharged a very important trust with an uniform intrepid firmness, and at the same time a tenderness and a liberal charity, which entitle him to be recorded with distinguished honour.</p>
<p class="p24">Upon this occasion, from the timidity and negligence of magistracy on the one hand, and the almost incredible exertions of the mob on the other, the first prison of this great country was laid open, and the prisoners set free; but that Mr. Akerman, whose house was burnt, would have prevented all this, had proper aid been sent to him in due time, there can be no doubt.</p>
<p class="p24">Many years ago, a fire broke out in the brick part which was built as an addition to the old gaol of Newgate. The prisoners were in consternation and tumult, calling out, &lsquo;We shall be burnt &mdash; we shall be burnt! Down with the gate &mdash; down with the gate!&rsquo; Mr. Akerman hastened to them, shewed himself at the gate, and having, after some confused vociferation of &lsquo;Hear him &mdash; hear him!&rsquo; obtained a silent attention, he then calmly told them, that the gate must not go down; that they were under his care, and that they should not be permitted to escape: but that he could assure them, they need not be afraid of being burnt, for that the fire was not in the prison, properly so called, which was strongly built with stone; and that if they would engage to be quiet, he himself would come in to them, and conduct them to the further end of the building, and would not go out till they gave him leave. To this proposal they agreed; upon which Mr. Akerman, having first made them fall back from the gate, went in, and with a determined resolution, ordered the outer turnkey upon no account to open the gate, even though the prisoners (though he trusted they would not) should break their word, and by force bring himself to order it. &lsquo;Never mind me, (said he,) should that happen.&rsquo; The prisoners peaceably followed him, while he conducted them through passages of which he had the keys, to the extremity of the gaol which was most distant from the fire. Having, by this very judicious conduct, fully satisfied them that there was no immediate risk, if any at all, he then addressed them thus: &lsquo;Gentlemen, you are now convinced that I told you true. I have no doubt that the engines will soon extinguish this fire; if they should not, a sufficient guard will come, and you shall all be taken out and lodged in the Compters. I assure you, upon my word and honour, that I have not a farthing insured. I have left my house, that I might take care of you. I will keep my promise, and stay with you if you insist upon it; but if you will allow me to go out and look after my family and property, I shall be obliged to you.&rsquo; Struck with his behaviour, they called out, &lsquo;Master Akerman, you have done bravely; it was very kind in you: by all means go and take care of your own concerns.&rsquo; He did so accordingly, while they remained, and were all preserved.</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson has been heard to relate the substance of this story with high praise, in which he was joined by Mr. Burke. My illustrious friend, speaking of Mr. Akerman&rsquo;s kindness to his prisoners, pronounced this eulogy upon his character:&mdash; &lsquo;He who has long had constantly in his view the worst of mankind, and is yet eminent for the humanity of his disposition, must have had it originally in a great degree, and continued to cultivate it very carefully.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">In the course of this month my brother David waited upon Dr. Johnson, with the following letter of introduction, which I had taken care should be lying ready on his arrival in London.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To DR. SAMUEL JOHNSON.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Edinburgh, April 29, 1780.</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">&lsquo;MY DEAR SIR,</span></p>
<p class="p21">&lsquo;This will be delivered to you by my brother David, on his return from Spain. You will be glad to see the man who vowed to &ldquo;stand by the old castle of Auchinleck, with heart, purse, and sword;&rdquo; that romantick family solemnity devised by me, of which you and I talked with complacency upon the spot. I trust that twelve years of absence have not lessened his feudal attachment; and that you will find him worthy of being introduced to your acquaintance.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I have the honour to be,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;With affectionate veneration,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;My dear Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your most faithful humble servant,</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;JAMES BOSWELL.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson received him very politely, and has thus mentioned him in a letter to Mrs. Thrale: &lsquo;I have had with me a brother of Boswell&rsquo;s, a Spanish merchant, whom the war has driven from his residence at Valentia; he is gone to see his friends, and will find Scotland but a sorry place after twelve years&rsquo; residence in a happier climate. He is a very agreeable man, and speaks no Scotch.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To DR. BEATTIE, AT ABERDEEN.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;More years than I have any delight to reckon, have past since you and I saw one another; of this, however, there is no reason for making any reprehensory complaint &mdash; <span class="t8">Sic fata ferunt</span>. But methinks there might pass some small interchange of regard between us. If you say, that I ought to have written, I now write; and I write to tell you, that I have much kindness for you and Mrs. Beattie; and that I wish your health better, and your life long. Try change of air, and come a few degrees Southwards: a softer climate may do you both good; winter is coming on; and London will be warmer, and gayer, and busier, and more fertile of amusement than Aberdeen.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;My health is better; but that will be little in the balance, when I tell you that Mrs. Montagu has been very ill, and is I doubt now but weakly. Mr. Thrale has been very dangerously disordered; but is much better, and I hope will totally recover. He has withdrawn himself from business the whole summer. Sir Joshua and his sister are well; and Mr. Davies has got great success as an authour, generated by the corruption of a bookseller. More news I have not to tell you, and therefore you must be contented with hearing, what I know not whether you much wish to hear, that I am, Sir,</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;Your most humble servant,<br/>&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;Bolt-court, Fleet-street,<br/>August 21, 1780.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To JAMES BOSWELL, Esq.</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I find you have taken one of your fits of taciturnity, and have resolved not to write till you are written to; it is but a peevish humour, but you shall have your way.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I have sat at home in Bolt-court, all the summer, thinking to write the <span class="t8">Lives</span>, and a great part of the time only thinking. Several of them, however, are done, and I still think to do the rest.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Mr. Thrale and his family have, since his illness, passed their time first at Bath, and then at Brighthelmston; but I have been at neither place. I would have gone to Lichfield, if I could have had time, and I might have had time if I had been active; but I have missed much, and done little.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;In the late disturbances, Mr. Thrale&rsquo;s house and stock were in great danger; the mob was pacified at their first invasion, with about fifty pounds in drink and meat; and at their second, were driven away by the soldiers. Mr. Strahan got a garrison into his house, and maintained them a fortnight; he was so frighted that he removed part of his goods. Mrs. Williams took shelter in the country.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I know not whether I shall get a ramble this autumn; it is now about the time when we were travelling. I have, however, better health than I had then, and hope you and I may yet shew ourselves on some part of Europe, Asia, or Africa. In the mean time let us play no trick, but keep each other&rsquo;s kindness by all means in our power.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The bearer of this is Dr. Dunbar, of Aberdeen, who has written and published a very ingenious book, and who I think has a kindness for me, and will, when he knows you, have a kindness for you.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I suppose your little ladies are grown tall; and your son is become a learned young man. I love them all, and I love your naughty lady, whom I never shall persuade to love me. When the <span class="t8">Lives</span> are done, I shall send them to complete her collection, but must send them in paper, as for want of a pattern, I cannot bind them to fit the rest.</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;I am, Sir,<br/>&lsquo;Yours most affectionately,<br/>&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;<br/>&lsquo;London, Aug. 21, 1780.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">This year he wrote to a young clergyman in the country, the following very excellent letter, which contains valuable advice to Divines in general: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Dear Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Not many days ago Dr. Lawrence shewed me a letter, in which you make mention of me: I hope, therefore, you will not be displeased that I endeavour to preserve your good-will by some observations which your letter suggested to me.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;You are afraid of falling into some improprieties in the daily service by reading to an audience that requires no exactness. Your fear, I hope, secures you from danger. They who contract absurd habits are such as have no fear. It is impossible to do the same thing very often, without some peculiarity of manner: but that manner may be good or bad, and a little care will at least preserve it from being bad: to make it good, there must, I think, be something of natural or casual felicity, which cannot be taught.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your present method of making your sermons seems very judicious. Few frequent preachers can be supposed to have sermons more their own than yours will be. Take care to register, somewhere or other, the authours from whom your several discourses are borrowed; and do not imagine that you shall always remember, even what perhaps you now think it impossible to forget.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;My advice, however, is, that you attempt, from time to time, an original sermon; and in the labour of composition, do not burthen your mind with too much at once; do not exact from yourself at one effort of excogitation, propriety of thought and elegance of expression. Invent first, and then embellish. The production of something, where nothing was before, is an act of greater energy than the expansion or decoration of the thing produced. Set down diligently your thoughts as they rise, in the first words that occur; and, when you have matter, you will easily give it form: nor, perhaps, will this method be always necessary; for by habit, your thoughts and diction will flow together.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The composition of sermons is not very difficult: the divisions not only help the memory of the hearer, but direct the judgement of the writer; they supply sources of invention, and keep every part in its proper place.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;What I like least in your letter is your account of the manners of your parish; from which I gather, that it has been long neglected by the parson. The Dean of Carlisle, who was then a little rector in Northamptonshire, told me, that it might be discerned whether or no there was a clergyman resident in a parish by the civil or savage manner of the people. Such a congregation as yours stands in need of much reformation; and I would not have you think it impossible to reform them. A very savage parish was civilised by a decayed gentlewoman, who came among them to teach a petty school. My learned friend Dr. Wheeler of Oxford, when he was a young man, had the care of a neighbouring parish for fifteen pounds a year, which he was never paid; but he counted it a convenience that it compelled him to make a sermon weekly. One woman he could not bring to the communion; and, when he reproved or exhorted her, she only answered, that she was no scholar. He was advised to set some good woman or man of the parish, a little wiser than herself, to talk to her in a language level to her mind. Such honest, I may call them holy artifices, must be practised by every clergyman; for all means must be tried by which souls may be saved. Talk to your people, however, as much as you can; and you will find, that the more frequently you converse with them upon religious subjects, the more willingly they will attend, and the more submissively they will learn. A clergyman&rsquo;s diligence always makes him venerable. I think I have now only to say, that in the momentous work you have undertaken, I pray GOD to bless you.</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;I am, Sir,<br/>&lsquo;Your most humble servant,<br/>&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Bolt-court, Aug. 30, 1780.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">My next letters to him were dated August 24, September 6, and October 1, and from them I extract the following passages: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;My brother David and I find the long indulged fancy of our comfortable meeting again at Auchinleck, so well realised, that it in some degree confirms the pleasing hope of <span class="t8">O! preclarum diem!</span> in a future state.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I beg that you may never again harbour a suspicion of my indulging a peevish humour, or playing tricks; you will recollect that when I confessed to you, that I had once been intentionally silent to try your regard, I gave you my word and honour that I would not do so again.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I rejoice to hear of your good state of health; I pray GOD to continue it long. I have often said, that I would willingly have ten years added to my life, to have ten taken from yours; I mean, that I would be ten years older to have you ten years younger. But let me be thankful for the years during which I have enjoyed your friendship, and please myself with the hopes of enjoying it many years to come in this state of being, trusting always, that in another state, we shall meet never to be separated. Of this we can form no notion; but the thought, though indistinct, is delightful, when the mind is calm and clear.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The riots in London were certainly horrible; but you give me no account of your own situation, during the barbarous anarchy. A description of it by DR. JOHNSON would be a great painting; you might write another <span class="t8">London, a Poem</span>.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am charmed with your condescending affectionate expression, &ldquo;let us keep each other&rsquo;s kindness by all the means in our power;&rdquo; my revered Friend! how elevating is it to my mind, that I am found worthy to be a companion to Dr. Samuel Johnson! All that you have said in grateful praise of Mr. Walmsley, I have long thought of you; but we are both Tories, which has a very general influence upon our sentiments. I hope that you will agree to meet me at York, about the end of this month; or if you will come to Carlisle, that would be better still, in case the Dean be there. Please to consider, that to keep each other&rsquo;s kindness, we should every year have that free and intimate communication of mind which can be had only when we are together. We should have both our solemn and our pleasant talk.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I write now for the third time, to tell you that my desire for our meeting this autumn, is much increased. I wrote to Squire Godfrey Bosville, my Yorkshire chief, that I should, perhaps, pay him a visit, as I was to hold a conference with Dr. Johnson at York. I give you my word and honour that I said not a word of his inviting you; but he wrote to me as follows: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;&ldquo;I need not tell you I shall be happy to see you here the latter end of this month, as you propose; and I shall likewise be in hopes that you will persuade Dr. Johnson to finish the conference here. It will add to the favour of your own company, if you prevail upon such an associate, to assist your observations. I have often been entertained with his writings, and I once belonged to a club of which he was a member, and I never spent an evening there, but I heard something from him well worth remembering.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;We have thus, my dear Sir, good comfortable quarters in the neighbourhood of York, where you may be assured we shall be heartily welcome. I pray you then resolve to set out; and let not the year 1780 be a blank in our social calendar, and in that record of wisdom and wit, which I keep with so much diligence, to your honour, and the instruction and delight of others.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Mr. Thrale had now another contest for the representation in parliament of the borough of Southwark, and Johnson kindly lent him his assistance, by writing advertisements and letters for him. I shall insert one as a specimen:</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">&lsquo;TO THE WORTHY ELECTORS OF THE BOROUGH OF SOUTHWARK.</span></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">&lsquo;GENTLEMEN,</span></p>
<p class="p21">&lsquo;A new Parliament being now called, I again solicit the honour of being elected for one of your representatives; and solicit it with the greater confidence, as I am not conscious of having neglected my duty, or of having acted otherwise than as becomes the independent representative of independent constituents; superiour to fear, hope, and expectation, who has no private purposes to promote, and whose prosperity is involved in the prosperity of his country. As my recovery from a very severe distemper is not yet perfect, I have declined to attend the Hall, and hope an omission so necessary will not be harshly censured.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I can only send my respectful wishes, that all your deliberations may tend to the happiness of the kingdom, and the peace of the borough.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am, Gentlemen,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your most faithful</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;And obedient servant,</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">&lsquo;HENRY THRALE.&rsquo;</span></p>
<p class="p21">&lsquo;Southwark, Sept. 5, 1780.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On his birth-day, Johnson has this note: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am now beginning the seventy-second year of my life, with more strength of body, and greater vigour of mind, than I think is common at that age.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">But still he complains of sleepless nights and idle days, and forgetfulness, or neglect of resolutions. He thus pathetically expresses himself, &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Surely I shall not spend my whole life with my own total disapprobation.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Mr. Macbean, whom I have mentioned more than once, as one of Johnson&rsquo;s humble friends, a deserving but unfortunate man, being now oppressed by age and poverty, Johnson solicited the Lord Chancellor Thurlow, to have him admitted into the Charterhouse. I take the liberty to insert his Lordship&rsquo;s answer, as I am eager to embrace every occasion of augmenting the respectable notion which should ever be entertained of my illustrious friend: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To DR. SAMUEL JOHNSON.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;London, October 24, 1780.</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I have this moment received your letter, dated the 19th, and returned from Bath.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;In the beginning of the summer I placed one in the Chartreux, without the sanction of a recommendation so distinct and so authoritative as yours of Macbean; and I am afraid, that according to the establishment of the House, the opportunity of making the charity so good amends will not soon recur. But whenever a vacancy shall happen, if you&rsquo;ll favour me with notice of it, I will try to recommend him to the place, even though it should not be my turn to nominate.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am, Sir, with great regard,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your most faithful</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;And obedient servant,</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">&lsquo;THURLOW.&rsquo;</span></p>
<p class="p21">&lsquo;To JAMES BOSWELL, ESQ.</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am sorry to write you a letter that will not please you, and yet it is at last what I resolve to do. This year must pass without an interview; the summer has been foolishly lost, like many other of my summers and winters. I hardly saw a green field, but staid in town to work, without working much.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Mr. Thrale&rsquo;s loss of health has lost him the election; he is now going to Brighthelmston, and expects me to go with him; and how long I shall stay, I cannot tell. I do not much like the place, but yet I shall go, and stay while my stay is desired. We must, therefore, content ourselves with knowing what we know as well as man can know the mind of man, that we love one another, and that we wish each other&rsquo;s happiness, and that the lapse of a year cannot lessen our mutual kindness.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I was pleased to be told that I accused Mrs. Boswell unjustly, in supposing that she bears me ill-will. I love you so much, that I would be glad to love all that love you, and that you love; and I have love very ready for Mrs. Boswell, if she thinks it worthy of acceptance. I hope all the young ladies and gentlemen are well.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I take a great liking to your brother. He tells me that his father received him kindly, but not fondly; however, you seem to have lived well enough at Auchinleck, while you staid. Make your father as happy as you can.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;You lately told me of your health: I can tell you in return, that my health has been for more than a year past, better than it has been for many years before. Perhaps it may please GOD to give us some time together before we are parted.</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;I am, dear Sir,<br/>&lsquo;Yours most affectionately,<br/>&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;<br/>&lsquo;October 17, 1780.&rsquo;</p>
