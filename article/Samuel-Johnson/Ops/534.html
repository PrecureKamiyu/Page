<h2 class="h20"><a id="a1144"></a>REVIEW OF MEMOIRS OF THE COURT OF AUGUSTUS;</h2>
<p class="p25">BY THOMAS BLACKWELL, J.U.D.</p>
<p class="p25">PRINCIPAL OF MARISCHAL COLLEGE, IN THE UNIVERSITY OF ABERDEEN .</p>
<p class="p21">The first effect, which this book has upon the reader, is that of disgusting him with the author&rsquo;s vanity. He endeavours to persuade the world, that here are some new treasures of literature spread before his eyes; that something is discovered, which, to this happy day, had been concealed in darkness; that, by his diligence, time has been robbed of some valuable monument which he was on the point of devouring; and that names and facts, doomed to oblivion, are now restored to fame.</p>
<p class="p24">How must the unlearned reader be surprised, when he shall be told that Mr. Blackwell has neither digged in the ruins of any demolished city, nor found out the way to the library of Fez; nor had a single book in his hands, that has not been in the possession of every man that was inclined to read it, for years and ages; and that his book relates to a people, who, above all others, have furnished employment to the studious, and amusements to the idle; who have scarcely left behind them a coin or a stone, which has not been examined and explained a thousand times; and whose dress, and food, and household stuff, it has been the pride of learning to understand.</p>
<p class="p24">A man need not fear to incur the imputation of vicious diffidence or affected humility, who should have forborne to promise many novelties, when he perceived such multitudes of writers possessed of the same materials, and intent upon the same purpose. Mr. Blackwell knows well the opinion of Horace, concerning those that open their undertakings with magnificent promises; and he knows, likewise, the dictates of common sense and common honesty, names of greater authority than that of Horace, who direct, that no man should promise what he cannot perform.</p>
<p class="p24">I do not mean to declare, that this volume has nothing new, or that the labours of those who have gone before our author, have made his performance an useless addition to the burden of literature. New works may be constructed with old materials; the disposition of the parts may show contrivance; the ornaments interspersed may discover elegance.</p>
<p class="p24">It is not always without good effect, that men, of proper qualifications, write, in succession, on the same subject, even when the latter add nothing to the information given by the former; for the same ideas may be delivered more intelligibly or more delightfully by one than by another, or with attractions that may lure minds of a different form. No writer pleases all, and every writer may please some.</p>
<p class="p24">But, after all, to inherit is not to acquire; to decorate is not to make; and the man, who had nothing to do but to read the ancient authors, who mention the Roman affairs, and reduce them to common places, ought not to boast himself as a great benefactor to the studious world.</p>
<p class="p24">After a preface of boast, and a letter of flattery, in which he seems to imitate the address of Horace, in his &ldquo;vile potabis modicis Sabinum&rdquo; &mdash; he opens his book with telling us, that the &ldquo;Roman republic, after the horrible proscription, was no more at <span class="t8">bleeding Rome</span>. The regal power of her consuls, the authority of her senate, and the majesty of her people, were now trampled under foot; these [for those] divine laws and hallowed customs, that had been the essence of her constitution &mdash; were set at nought, and her best friends were lying exposed in their blood.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">These were surely very dismal times to those who suffered; but I know not, why any one but a schoolboy, in his declamation, should whine over the commonwealth of Rome, which grew great only by the misery of the rest of mankind. The Romans, like others, as soon as they grew rich, grew corrupt, and, in their corruption, sold the lives and freedoms of themselves, and of one another.</p>
<p class="p24">&ldquo;About this time, Brutus had his patience put to the <span class="t8">highest</span> trial: he had been married to Clodia; but whether the family did not please him, or whether he was dissatisfied with the lady&rsquo;s behaviour during his absence, he soon entertained thoughts of a separation. <span class="t8">This raised a good deal of talk</span>, and the women of the Clodian family inveighed bitterly against Brutus &mdash; but he married Portia, who was worthy of such a father as M. Cato, and such a husband as M. Brutus. She had a soul capable of an <span class="t8">exalted passion</span>, and found a proper object to raise and give it a sanction; she did not only love but adored her husband; his worth, his truth, his every shining and heroic quality, made her gaze on him like a god, while the endearing returns of esteem and tenderness she met with, brought her joy, her pride, her every wish to centre in her beloved Brutus.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">When the reader has been awakened by this rapturous preparation, he hears the whole story of Portia in the same luxuriant style, till she breathed out her last, a little before the <span class="t8">bloody proscription</span>, and &ldquo;Brutus complained heavily of his friends at Rome, as not having paid due attention to his lady in the declining state of her health.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He is a great lover of modern terms. His senators and their wives are <span class="t8">gentlemen and ladies</span>. In this review of Brutus&rsquo;s army, <span class="t8">who was under the command of gallant men, not braver officers than true patriots</span>, he tells <span class="t8">us</span>, &ldquo;that Sextus, the questor, was <span class="t8">paymaster, secretary at war, and commissary general</span>; and that the <span class="t8">sacred discipline</span> of the Romans required the closest connexion, like that of father and son, to subsist between the general of an army and his questor. Cicero was <span class="t8">general of the cavalry</span>, and the next <span class="t8">general officer</span> was Flavius, <span class="t8">master of Ihe artillery</span>, the elder Lentulus was <span class="t8">admiral</span>, and the younger <span class="t8">rode</span> in the <span class="t8">band of volunteers</span>; under these the tribunes, <span class="t8">with many others, too tedious to name</span>.&rdquo; Lentulus, however, was but a subordinate officer; for we are informed afterwards, that the Romans had made Sextus Pompeius lord high admiral in all the seas of their dominions. Among other affectations of this writer, is a furious and unnecessary zeal for liberty; or rather, for one form of government as preferable to another. This, indeed, might be suffered, because political institution is a subject in which men have always differed, and, if they continue to obey their lawful governours, and attempt not to make innovations, for the sake of their favourite schemes, they may differ for ever, without any just reproach from one another. But who can bear the hardy champion, who ventures nothing? who, in full security, undertakes the defence of the assassination of Cassar, and declares his resolution to speak plain? Yet let not just sentiments be overlooked: he has justly observed, that the greater part of mankind will be naturally prejudiced against Brutus, for all feel the benefits of private friendship; but few can discern the advantages of a well-constituted government .</p>
<p class="p24">We know not whether some apology may not be necessary for the distance between the first account of this book and its continuation. The truth is, that this work, not being forced upon our attention by much publick applause or censure, was sometimes neglected, and sometimes forgotten; nor would it, perhaps, have been now resumed, but that we might avoid to disappoint our readers by an abrupt desertion of any subject.</p>
<p class="p24">It is not our design to criticise the facts of this history, but the style; not the veracity, but the address of the writer; for, an account of the ancient Romans, as it cannot nearly interest any present reader, and must be drawn from writings that have been long known, can owe its value only to the language in which it is delivered, and the reflections with which it is accompanied. Dr. Blackwell, however, seems to have heated his imagination, so as to be much affected with every event, and to believe that he can affect others. Enthusiasm is, indeed, sufficiently contagious; but I never found any of his readers much enamoured of the <span class="t8">glorious Pompey, the patriot approv&rsquo;d</span>, or much incensed against the <span class="t8">lawless Caesar</span>, whom this author, probably, stabs every day and night in his sleeping or waking dreams.</p>
<p class="p24">He is come too late into the world with his fury for freedom, with his Brutus and Cassius. We have all, on this side of the Tweed, long since settled our opinions: his zeal for Roman liberty and declamations against the violators of the republican constitution, only stand now in the reader&rsquo;s way, who wishes to proceed in the narrative without the interruption of epithets and exclamations. It is not easy to forbear laughter at a man so bold in fighting shadows, so busy in a dispute two thousand years past, and so zealous for the honour of a people, who, while they were poor, robbed mankind, and, as soon as they became rich, robbed one another. Of these robberies our author seems to have no very quick sense, except when they are committed by Caesar&rsquo;s party, for every act is sanctified by the name of a patriot.</p>
<p class="p24">If this author&rsquo;s skill in ancient literature were less generally acknowledged, one might sometimes suspect, that he had too frequently consulted the French writers. He tells us, that Archelaus, the Rhodian, made a speech to Cassius, and, <span class="t8">in so saying</span>, dropt some tears; and that Cassius, after the reduction of Rhodes, was <span class="t8">covered with glory</span>. &mdash; Deiotarus was a keen and happy spirit &mdash; the ingrate Castor kept his court.</p>
<p class="p24">His great delight is to show his universal acquaintance with terms of art, with words that every other polite writer has avoided and despised. When Pompey conquered the pirates, he destroyed fifteen hundred ships of the line. &mdash; The Xanthian parapets were tore down. &mdash; Brutus, suspecting that his troops were plundering, commanded the trumpets to sound to their colours. &mdash; Most people understood the act of attainder passed by the senate. &mdash; The Numidian troopers were unlikely in their appearance. &mdash; The Numidians beat up one quarter after another. &mdash; Salvidienus resolved to pass his men over, in boats of leather, and he gave orders for equipping a sufficient number of that sort of small craft. &mdash; Pompey had light, agile frigates, and fought in a strait, where the current and caverns occasion swirls and a roll. &mdash; A sharp out-look was kept by the admiral. &mdash; It is a run of about fifty Roman miles. &mdash; Brutus broke Lipella in the sight of the army. &mdash; Mark Antony garbled the senate. He was a brave man, well qualified for a commodore.</p>
<p class="p24">In his choice of phrases he frequently uses words with great solemnity, which every other mouth and pen has appropriated to jocularity and levity! The Rhodians gave up the contest, and, in poor plight, fled back to Rhodes. &mdash; Boys and girls were easily kidnapped. &mdash; Deiotarus was a mighty believer of augury. &mdash; Deiotarus destroyed his ungracious progeny. &mdash; The regularity of the Romans was their mortal aversion. &mdash; They desired the consuls to curb such heinous doings. &mdash; He had such a shrewd invention, that no side of a question came amiss to him. &mdash; Brutus found his mistress a coquettish creature.</p>
<p class="p24">He sometimes, with most unlucky dexterity, mixes the grand and the burlesque together; <span class="t8">the violation of faith, sir</span>, says Cassius, <span class="t8">lies at the door of the Rhodians by reite-rated acts of perfidy</span>. &mdash; The iron grate fell down, crushed those under it to death, and catched the rest as in a trap. &mdash; When the Xanthians heard the military shout, and saw the flame mount, they concluded there would be no mercy. It was now about sunset, and they had been at hot work since noon.</p>
<p class="p24">He has, often, words, or phrases, with which our language has hitherto had no knowledge. &mdash; One was a heart-friend to the republic &mdash; A deed was expeded. &mdash; The Numidians begun to reel, and were in hazard of falling into confusion. &mdash; The tutor embraced his pupil close in his arms. &mdash; Four hundred women were taxed, who have, no doubt, been the wives of the best Roman citizens. &mdash; Men not born to action are inconsequential in government. &mdash; Collectitious troops. &mdash; The foot, by their violent attack, began the fatal break in the Pharsaliac field. &mdash; He and his brother, with a politic, common to other countries, had taken opposite sides.</p>
<p class="p24">His epithets are of the gaudy or hyperbolical kind. The glorious news &mdash; eager hopes and dismal fears &mdash; bleeding Rome &mdash; divine laws and hallowed customs &mdash; merciless war &mdash; intense anxiety.</p>
<p class="p24">Sometimes the reader is suddenly ravished with a sonorous sentence, of which, when the noise is past, the meaning does not long remain. When Brutus set his legions to fill a moat, instead of heavy dragging and slow toil, they set about it with huzzas and racing, as if they had been striving at the Olympic games. They hurled impetuous down the huge trees and stones, and, with shouts, forced them into the water; so that the work, expected to continue half the campaign, was, with rapid toil, completed in a few days. Brutus&rsquo;s soldiers fell to the gate with resistless fury; it gave way, at last, with hideous crash. &mdash; This great and good man, doing his duty to his country, received a mortal wound, and glorious fell in the cause of Rome; may his memory be ever dear to all lovers of liberty, learning, and humanity! This promise ought ever to embalm his memory. &mdash; The queen of nations was torn by no foreign invader. &mdash; Rome fell a sacrifice to her own sons, and was ravaged by her unnatural offspring: all the great men of the state, all the good, all the holy, were openly murdered by the wickedest and worst. &mdash; Little islands cover the harbour of Brindisi, and form the narrow outlet from the numerous creeks that compose its capacious port. &mdash; At the appearance of Brutus and Cassius, a shout of joy rent the heavens from the surrounding multitudes.</p>
<p class="p24">Such are the flowers which may be gathered, by every hand, in every part of this garden of eloquence. But having thus freely mentioned our author&rsquo;s faults, it remains that we acknowledge his merit; and confess, that this book is the work of a man of letters, that it is full of events displayed with accuracy, and related with vivacity; and though it is sufficiently defective to crush the vanity of its author, it is sufficiently entertaining to invite readers.</p>
