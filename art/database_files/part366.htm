An enterprise-scale ap- plication that runs on a centralized database system today may have from tens to thou- sands of users and database sizes ranging from megabytes to hundreds of gigabytes.</p><p class="s13" style="padding-left: 119pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">Parallel database systems <span class="p">were developed, starting in the late 1980s to execute tasks in parallel on a large number of machines. These were developed to handle high-end enterprise applications whose requirements in terms of transaction processing perfor- mance, time to process decision support queries, and storage capacity could not be met by centralized databases. These databases were designed to run in parallel on hundreds of machines. Today, the growth of parallel databases is driven not just by enterprise ap- plications, but even more so by web-scale applications, which may have millions to even hundreds of millions of users and may need to deal with many petabytes of data.</span></p><p class="s13" style="padding-left: 119pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">Parallel data storage systems <span class="p">are designed primarily to store and retrieve data based on keys. Unlike parallel databases, data storage systems typically provide very limited support for transactions, and they lack support for declarative querying. On the other hand, such systems can be run in parallel on very large numbers of machines (thou- sands to tens of thousands), a scale that most parallel databases cannot handle.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 119pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">Further, data are often generated and stored on diﬀerent database systems, and there is a need to execute queries and update transactions across multiple databases. This need led to the development of <i>distributed database systems</i>. Techniques developed for fault tolerance in the context of distributed databases today also play a key role in</p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 119pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;">961</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 88pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark451">ensuring the extremely high reliability and availability of massively parallel database and data storage systems.</a><a name="bookmark498">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="padding-left: 88pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">We study the architecture of database systems in this chapter, starting with the traditional centralized architectures and covering parallel and distributed database ar- chitectures. We cover issues of parallel and distributed data storage and indexing in Chapter 21. Chapter 22 covers issues of parallel and distributed query processing, while Chapter 23 covers issues of parallel and distributed transaction processing.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part365.htm">&lt; 上一个</a><span> | </span><a href="../database.html">内容</a><span> | </span><a href="part367.htm">下一个 &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
