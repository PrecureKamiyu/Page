Certainly, Alice wants only Bob to be able to understand a message that she has sent, even though they <i>are</i> communicating over an insecure medium where an intruder (Trudy, the intruder) may intercept whatever is transmitted from Alice to Bob. Bob also wants to be sure that the message he receives from Alice was indeed sent by Alice, and Alice wants to make sure that the person with whom she is communicating is indeed Bob. Alice and Bob also want to make sure that the contents of their messages have not been altered in transit. They also want to be assured that they can communicate in the first place (i.e., that no one denies them access to the resources needed to communicate). Given these considerations, we can identify the following desirable properties of <span class="keyword" id="P7001011952000000000000000002D57" data-uri="M08_KURO4140_07_SE_C08.xhtml#P7001011952000000000000000002D57"><b>secure communication</b></span>.</p>

This aspect of confidentiality is probably the most commonly perceived meaning of the term <i>secure communication</i>.

Face-to-face human communication solves this problem easily by visual recognition. When communicating entities exchange messages over a medium where they cannot see the other party, authentication is not so simple. When a user wants to access an inbox, how does the mail server verify that the user is the person he or she claims to be? We study end-point authentication in <a class="xref" href="fileP7001011952000000000000000002F6A.xhtml#P7001011952000000000000000002F6A" data-foobar="7"><span class="label">Section</span> <span class="number">8.4</span></a>.</p></li>

These networks therefore can potentially be compromised. Attackers can attempt to deposit worms into the hosts in the network, obtain corporate secrets, map the internal network configurations, and launch DoS attacks. We’ll see in <a class="xref" href="fileP7001011952000000000000000003128.xhtml#P7001011952000000000000000003128" data-foobar="7"><span class="label">Section</span> <span class="number">8.9</span></a> that operational devices such as firewalls and intrusion detection systems are used to counter attacks against an organization’s network. A firewall sits between the organization’s network and the public network, controlling packet access to and from the network. An intrusion detection system performs “deep packet ­inspection,” ­alerting the network administrators about suspicious activity.</p></li>

Alice, the sender, wants to send data to Bob, the receiver. In order to exchange data securely, while meeting the requirements of confidentiality, end-point authentication, and message integrity, Alice and Bob will exchange control messages and data messages (in much the same way that TCP senders and receivers exchange control segments and data segments).</p>

A summary of reported attacks is maintained at the CERT Coordination Center <a class="biblioref" href="fileP70010119520000000000000000037E0.xhtml#P700101195200000000000000000386D" data-foobar="7">[CERT 2016]</a>.</p>

Certainly, Bob and Alice might be human users at two end systems, for example, a real Alice and a real Bob who really do want to exchange secure e-mail. They might also be participants in an electronic commerce transaction. For example, a real Bob might want to transfer his credit card number securely to a Web server to purchase an item online. Similarly, a real Alice might want to interact with her bank online. The parties needing secure communication might themselves also be part of the network infrastructure. Recall that the domain name system (DNS, see <a class="xref" href="fileP7001011952000000000000000000C38.xhtml#P7001011952000000000000000000C38" data-foobar="7"><span class="label">Section</span> <span class="number">2.4</span></a>) or routing daemons that exchange routing information (see <a class="xref" href="fileP7001011952000000000000000001EDE.xhtml#P7001011952000000000000000001EDE" data-foobar="7"><span class="label">Chapter</span> <span class="number">5</span></a>) require secure communication between two parties. The same is true for network management applications, a topic we examined in <a class="xref" href="fileP7001011952000000000000000001EDE.xhtml#P7001011952000000000000000001EDE" data-foobar="7"><span class="label">Chapter</span> <span class="number">5</span></a>).
