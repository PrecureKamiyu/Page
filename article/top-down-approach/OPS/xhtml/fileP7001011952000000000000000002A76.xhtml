But most WiFi hotspots have a small coverage area of between 10 and 100 meters in diameter. What do we do then when we have a desperate need for wireless Internet access and we cannot access a WiFi hotspot?</p>
<p id="P700101195200000000000000000B3DF" data-uri="M07_KURO4140_07_SE_C07.xhtml#P700101195200000000000000000B3DF">Given that cellular telephony is now ubiquitous in many areas throughout the world, a natural strategy is to extend cellular networks so that they support not only voice telephony but wireless Internet access as well. Ideally, this Internet access would be at a reasonably high speed and would provide for seamless mobility, allowing users to maintain their TCP sessions while traveling, for example, on a bus or a train. With sufficiently high upstream and downstream bit rates, the user could even maintain video-conferencing sessions while roaming about. This scenario is not that far-fetched. Data rates of several megabits per second are becoming available as broadband data services such as those we will cover here become more widely deployed.</p>

In some countries (e.g., Korea and Japan), 4G LTE coverage is higher than 90%—nearly ubiquitous. In 2015, average download rates over deployed LTE systems range from 10Mbps in the US and India to close to 40 Mbps in New Zealand. These 4G systems are being deployed in licensed radio-frequency bands, with some operators paying considerable sums to governments for spectrum-use licenses. 4G systems allow users to access the Internet from remote outdoor locations while on the move, in a manner similar to today’s cellular phone-only access. In many cases, a user may have simultaneous access to both wireless LANs and 4G. With the capacity of 4G systems being both more constrained and more expensive, many mobile devices default to the use of WiFi rather than 4G, when both are avilable. The question of whether wireless edge network access will be primarily over wireless LANs or cellular systems remains an open question:</p>

IEEE 802.11 wireless LANs, operating at 54 Mbps and higher, are enjoying widespread deployment. Essentially all laptops, tablets and smartphones are factory-equipped with 802.11 LAN capabilities. Furthermore, emerging Internet appliances—such as wireless cameras and picture frames—also have low-powered wireless LAN capabilities.</p></li>

Many phones are already capable of connecting to the cellular phone network or to an IP network either natively or using a Skype-like Voice-over-IP service, thus bypassing the operator’s cellular voice and 4G data services.</p></li>

Most likely, both WiFi and 4G will both become prevalent wireless technologies, with roaming ­wireless devices automatically selecting the access technology that provides the best service at their current physical location.</p>

First generation (1G) systems were analog FDMA systems designed exclusively for voice-only communication. These 1G systems are almost extinct now, having been replaced by digital 2G systems. The original 2G systems were also designed for voice, but later extended (2.5G) to support data (i.e., Internet) as well as voice service. 3G systems also support voice and data, but with an emphasis on data capabilities and higher-speed radio access links. The 4G systems being deployed today are based on LTE technology, feature an all-IP core network, and provide integrated voice and data at multi-Megabit speeds.</p>

(GPRS stands for Generalized Packet Radio Service, an early cellular data service in 2G networks; here we discuss the evolved version of GPRS in 3G networks). An SGSN is responsible for delivering datagrams to/from the mobile nodes in the radio access network to which the SGSN is attached. The SGSN interacts with the cellular voice network’s MSC for that area, providing user authorization and handoff, maintaining location (cell) information about active mobile nodes, and performing datagram forwarding between mobile nodes in the radio access network and a GGSN. The GGSN acts as a gateway, connecting multiple SGSNs into the larger Internet. A GGSN is thus the last piece of 3G infrastructure that a datagram originating at a mobile node encounters before entering the larger Internet. To the outside world, the GGSN looks like any other gateway router; the mobility of the 3G nodes within the GGSN’s network is hidden from the outside world behind the GGSN.</p>
