In this case, the system will constantly be paging, a condition sometimes referred to as <b>thrashing </b>[D70].</p><p style="padding-left: 68pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Some earlier operating systems had a fairly sophisticated set of mech- anisms to both detect and cope with thrashing when it took place. For example, given a set of processes, a system could decide not to run a sub- set of processes, with the hope that the reduced set of processes <b>working sets </b>(the pages that they are using actively) fit in memory and thus can make progress. This approach, generally known as <b>admission control</b>, states that it is sometimes better to do less work well than to try to do everything at once poorly, a situation we often encounter in real life as well as in modern computer systems (sadly).</p><p style="padding-left: 68pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Some current systems take more a draconian approach to memory overload. For example, some versions of Linux run an <b>out-of-memory killer </b>when memory is oversubscribed; this daemon chooses a memory- intensive process and kills it, thus reducing memory in a none-too-subtle manner. While successful at reducing memory pressure, this approach can have problems, if, for example, it kills the X server and thus renders any applications requiring the display unusable.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part242.htm">&lt; 上一个</a><span> | </span><a href="../ostep.html">内容</a><span> | </span><a href="part244.htm">下一个 &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
