In this section, we’ll drop down a layer in the protocol stack and examine how cryptography can enhance TCP with security services, including confidentiality, data integrity, and end-point authentication.

Since its inception, SSL has enjoyed broad deployment. SSL is supported by all popular Web browsers and Web servers, and it is used by Gmail and essentially all Internet commerce sites (including Amazon, eBay, and TaoBao). Hundreds of billions of dollars are spent over SSL every year. In fact, if you have ever purchased anything over the Internet with your credit card, the communication between your browser and the server for this purchase almost certainly went over SSL. (You can identify that SSL is being used by your browser when the URL begins with https: rather than http.)</p>

Bob is surfing the Web and arrives at the Alice Incorporated site, which is selling perfume. The Alice Incorporated site displays a form in which Bob is supposed to enter the type of perfume and quantity desired, his address, and his payment card number. Bob enters this information, clicks on Submit, and expects to receive (via ordinary postal mail) the purchased perfumes; he also expects to receive <span class="pagebreak" title="632" id="P7001011952000000000000000002FFD" data-uri="M08_KURO4140_07_SE_C08.xhtml#P7001011952000000000000000002FFD" epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>a charge for his order in his next payment card statement.

However, because SSL secures TCP, it can be employed by any application that runs over TCP. SSL provides a simple Application Programmer Interface (API) with sockets, which is similar and analogous to TCP’s API. When an application wants to employ SSL, the application includes SSL classes/libraries.

Almost-SSL (and SSL) has three phases: <i>handshake</i>, <i>key derivation</i>, and <i>data transfer</i>. We now describe these three phases for a communication session between a client (Bob) and a server (Alice), with Alice having a private/public key pair and a certificate that binds her identity to her public key.</p>

These three steps are shown in <a class="xref" href="#P7001011952000000000000000003016" data-foobar="1"><span class="label">Figure</span> <span class="number">8.25</span></a>. Note that once the TCP connection is established, Bob sends Alice a hello message. Alice then responds with her certificate, which contains her public key. As discussed in <a class="xref" href="fileP7001011952000000000000000002E7A.xhtml#P7001011952000000000000000002E7A" data-foobar="7"><span class="label">Section</span> <span class="number">8.3</span></a>, because the certificate has been certified by a CA, Bob knows for sure that the public key in the certificate belongs to Alice. Bob then generates a Master Secret (MS) (which will only be used for this SSL session), encrypts the MS with Alice’s public key to create the Encrypted Master Secret (EMS), and sends the EMS to Alice. Alice decrypts the EMS with her private key to get the MS. After this phase, both Bob and Alice (and no one else) know the master secret for this SSL session.</p>

Since TCP is a byte-stream protocol, a natural approach would be for SSL to encrypt application data on the fly and then pass the encrypted data on the fly to TCP. But if we were to do this, where would we put the MAC for the integrity check? We certainly do not want to wait until the end of the TCP session to verify the integrity of all of Bob’s data that was sent over the entire session! To address this issue, SSL breaks the data stream into records, appends a MAC to each record for integrity checking, and then encrypts the record <span class="inlineequation"><m:math display="inline" alttext="" data-uri="" altimg-width="58" altimg-height="13" altimg="../images/ch08math136.png"><m:mrow><m:mo>+</m:mo><m:mtext>MAC</m:mtext></m:mrow></m:math></span>. To create the MAC, Bob inputs the record data along with the key M<sub>B</sub> into a hash function, as discussed in <a class="xref" href="fileP7001011952000000000000000002E7A.xhtml#P7001011952000000000000000002E7A" data-foobar="7"><span class="label">Section</span> <span class="number">8.3</span></a>.

In particular, suppose Trudy is a woman-in-the-middle and has the ability to insert, delete, and replace segments in the stream of TCP segments sent between Alice and Bob. Trudy, for example, could capture two segments sent by Bob, reverse the order of the segments, adjust the TCP sequence numbers (which are not encrypted), and then send the two reverse-ordered segments to Alice. Assuming that each TCP segment encapsulates exactly one record, let’s now take a look at how Alice would process these segments.</p>

SSL does this as follows. Bob maintains a sequence number counter, which begins at zero and is incremented for each SSL record he sends. Bob doesn’t actually include a sequence number in the record itself, but when he calculates the MAC, he includes the sequence number in the MAC calculation. Thus, the MAC is now a hash of the data plus the MAC key M<sub>B</sub> <i>plus the current sequence number</i>. Alice tracks Bob’s sequence numbers, allowing her to verify the data integrity of a record by including the appropriate sequence number in the MAC calculation. This use of SSL sequence numbers prevents Trudy from carrying out a woman-in-the-middle attack, such as reordering or replaying segments. (Why?)</p>

SSL at the receiving end uses the length field to extract the SSL records out of the incoming TCP byte stream. The version field is self-explanatory.</p>

Instead, SSL allows Alice and Bob to agree on the cryptographic algorithms at the beginning of the SSL session, during the handshake phase. Additionally, during the handshake phase, Alice and Bob send nonces to each other, which are used in the creation of the session keys (E<sub>B</sub>, M<sub>B</sub>, E<sub>A</sub>, and M<sub>A</sub>). The steps of the real SSL handshake are as follows:</p>

The MS is then sliced up to generate the two encryption and two MAC keys. Furthermore, when the chosen symmetric cipher employs CBC (such as 3DES or AES), then two Initialization Vectors (IVs)—one for each side of the connection—are also obtained from the MS.

To see this, observe that in step 1, the client typically offers a list of algorithms—some strong, some weak. This list of algorithms is sent in cleartext, since the encryption algorithms and keys have not yet been agreed upon. Trudy, as a woman-in-the-middle, could delete the stronger algorithms from the list, forcing the client to select a weak algorithm. To prevent such a tampering attack, in step 5 the client sends a MAC of the concatenation of all the handshake messages it sent and received. The server can compare this MAC with the MAC of the handshake messages it received and sent. If there is an inconsistency, the server can terminate the connection. Similarly, the server sends a MAC of the handshake messages it has seen, allowing the client to check for inconsistencies.</p>

Don’t sequence numbers suffice for preventing the segment replay attack? The answer is yes, but they don’t alone prevent the “connection replay attack.” Consider the following connection <span class="pagebreak" title="637" id="P700101195200000000000000000305A" data-uri="M08_KURO4140_07_SE_C08.xhtml#P700101195200000000000000000305A" epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>replay attack. Suppose Trudy sniffs all messages between Alice and Bob. The next day, Trudy masquerades as Bob and sends to Alice exactly the same sequence of messages that Bob sent to Alice on the previous day. If Alice doesn’t use nonces, she will respond with exactly the same sequence of messages she sent the previous day. Alice will not suspect any funny business, as each message she receives will pass the integrity check. If Alice is an e-commerce server, she will think that Bob is placing a second order (for exactly the same thing). On the other hand, by including a nonce in the protocol, Alice will send different nonces for each TCP session, causing the encryption keys to be different on the two days. Therefore, when Alice receives played-back SSL records from Trudy, the records will fail the integrity checks, and the bogus e-commerce transaction will not succeed. In summary, in SSL, nonces are used to defend against the “connection replay attack” and sequence numbers are used to defend against replaying individual packets during an ongoing session.</p>

One approach would be to let Bob end the SSL session by simply terminating the underlying TCP connection—that is, by having Bob send a TCP FIN segment to Alice. But such a naive design sets the stage for the <i>truncation attack</i> whereby Trudy once again gets in the middle of an ongoing SSL session and ends the session early with a TCP FIN. If Trudy were to do this, Alice would think she received all of Bob’s data when ­actuality she only received a portion of it. The solution to this problem is to indicate in the type field whether the record serves to terminate the SSL session. (Although the SSL type is sent in the clear, it is authenticated at the receiver using the record’s MAC.) By including such a field, if Alice were to receive a TCP FIN before ­receiving a closure SSL record, she would know that something funny was going on.</p>
