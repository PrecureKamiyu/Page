<title>KING HENRY VI. PART I.</title>

<h2 class="h20"><a id="a1911"></a>KING HENRY VI. PART I.</h2>
<p class="p21">Of this play there is no copy earlier than that of the folio in 1623, though the two succeeding parts are extant in two editions in quarto. That the second and third parts were published without the first, may be admitted, as no weak proof that the copies were surreptitiously obtained, and that the printers of that time gave the publick those plays, not such as the author designed, but such as they could get them. That this play was written before the two others is indubitably collected from the series of events; that it was written and played before Henry V. is apparent, because in the epilogue there is mention made of this play, and not of the other parts:</p>
<p class="p26">&nbsp;Henry the sixth in swaddling bands crown&rsquo;d king,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose state so many had i&rsquo; the managing<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;That they lost France, and made all England rue,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Which oft our stage hath shown.</p>
<p class="p24">France is lost in this play. The two following contain, as the old title imports, the contention of the houses of York and Lancaster.</p>
<p class="p24">The two first parts of Henry VI. were printed in 1600. When Henry V. was written, we know not, but it was printed likewise in 1600, and, therefore, before the publication of the first and second parts: the first part of Henry VI. had been often shown on the stage, and would certainly have appeared in its place had the author been the publisher.</p>
