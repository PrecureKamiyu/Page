<title>THE JOURNAL OF A TOUR TO THE HEBRIDES WITH SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.</title>
</head>
<body>
<h2 class="h20"><a id="a2663"></a>THE JOURNAL OF A TOUR TO THE HEBRIDES WITH SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.</h2>
<p class="p21">Dr. Johnson had for many years given me hopes that we should go together, and visit the Hebrides. Martin&rsquo;s Account of those islands had impressed us with a notion that we might there contemplate a system of life almost totally different from what we had been accustomed to see; and, to find simplicity and wildness, and all the circumstances of remote time or place, so near to our native great island, was an object within the reach of reasonable curiosity. Dr. Johnson has said in his <span class="t8">Journey</span> &lsquo;that he scarcely remembered how the wish to visit the Hebrides was excited;&rsquo; but he told me, in summer, 1763, that his father put Martin&rsquo;s Account into his hands when he was very young, and that he was much pleased with it. We reckoned there would be some inconveniencies and hardships, and perhaps a little danger; but these we were persuaded were magnified in the imagination of every body. When I was at Ferney, in 1764, I mentioned our design to Voltaire. He looked at me, as if I had talked of going to the North Pole, and said, &lsquo;You do not insist on my accompanying you?&rsquo;&mdash; &lsquo;No, Sir,&rsquo;&mdash; &lsquo;Then I am very willing you should go.&rsquo; I was not afraid that our curious expedition would be prevented by such apprehensions; but I doubted that it would not be possible to prevail on Dr. Johnson to relinquish, for some time, the felicity of a London life, which, to a man who can enjoy it with full intellectual relish, is apt to make existence in any narrower sphere seem insipid or irksome. I doubted that he would not be willing to come down from his elevated state of philosophical dignity; from a superiority of wisdom among the wise, and of learning among the learned; and from flashing his wit upon minds bright enough to reflect it.</p>
<p class="p24">He had disappointed my expectations so long, that I began to despair; but in spring, 1773, he talked of coming to Scotland that year with so much firmness, that I hoped he was at last in earnest. I knew that, if he were once launched from the metropolis he would go forward very well; and I got our common friends there to assist in setting him afloat. To Mrs. Thrale in particular, whose enchantment over him seldom failed, I was much obliged. It was, &lsquo;<span class="t8">I&rsquo;ll give thee a wind.</span>&rsquo;-&rsquo; <span class="t8">Thou art kind.</span>&rsquo; &mdash; To <span class="t8">attract</span> him, we had invitations from the chiefs Macdonald and Macleod; and, for additional aid, I wrote to Lord Elibank, Dr. William Robertson, and Dr. Beattie.</p>
<p class="p24">To Dr. Robertson, so far as my letter concerned the present subject, I wrote as follows:</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Our friend, Mr. Samuel Johnson, is in great health and spirits; and, I do think, has a serious resolution to visit Scotland this year. The more attraction, however, the better; and therefore, though I know he will be happy to meet you there, it will forward the scheme, if, in your answer to this, you express yourself concerning it with that power of which you are so happily possessed, and which may be so directed as to operate strongly upon him.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">His answer to that part of my letter was quite as I could have wished. It was written with the address and persuasion of the historian of America. &lsquo;When I saw you last, you gave us some hopes that you might prevail with Mr. Johnson to make out that excursion to Scotland, with the expectation of which we have long flattered ourselves. If he could order matters so, as to pass some time in Edinburgh, about the close of the summer session, and then visit some of the Highland scenes, I am confident he would be pleased with the grand features of nature in many parts of this country: he will meet with many persons here who respect him, and some whom I am persuaded he will think not unworthy of his esteem. I wish he would make the experiment. He sometimes cracks his jokes upon us; but he will find that we can distinguish between the stabs of malevolence, and <span class="t8">the rebukes of the righteous, which are like excellent oil, and break not the head</span>. Offer my best compliments to him, and assure him that I shall be happy to have the satisfaction of seeing him under my roof.</p>
<p class="p24">To Dr. Beattie I wrote, &lsquo;The chief intention of this letter is to inform you, that I now seriously believe Mr. Samuel Johnson will visit Scotland this year: but I wish that every power of attraction may be employed to secure our having so valuable an acquisition, and therefore I hope you will without delay write to me what I know you think, that I may read it to the mighty sage, with proper emphasis, before I leave London, which I must do soon. He talks of you with the same warmth that he did last year. We are to see as much of Scotland as we can, in the months of August and September. We shall not be long of being at Marischal College. He is particularly desirous of seeing some of the Western Islands.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Dr. Beattie did better: <span class="t8">ipse venit</span>. He was, however, so polite as to wave his privilege of <span class="t8">nil mihi rescribas</span>, and wrote from Edinburgh, as follows:&mdash; &lsquo;Your very kind and agreeable favour of the 20th of April overtook me here yesterday, after having gone to Aberdeen, which place I left about a week ago. I am to set out this day for London, and hope to have the honour of paying my respects to Mr. Johnson and you, about a week or ten days hence. I shall then do what I can, to enforce the topick you mention; but at present I cannot enter upon it, as I am in a very great hurry; for I intend to begin my journey within an hour or two.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He was as good as his word, and threw some pleasing motives into the northern scale. But, indeed, Mr. Johnson loved all that he heard, from one whom he tells us, in his <span class="t8">Lives of the Poets</span>, Gray found &lsquo;a poet, a philosopher, and a good man.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">My Lord Elibank did not answer my letter to his lordship for some time. The reason will appear, when we come to the isle of <span class="t8">Sky</span>. I shall then insert my letter, with letters from his lordship, both to myself and Mr. Johnson. I beg it may be understood, that I insert my own letters, as I relate my own sayings, rather as keys to what is valuable belonging to others, than for their own sake.</p>
<p class="p24">Luckily Mr. Justice (now Sir Robert) Chambers, who was about to sail for the East-Indies, was going to take leave of his relations at Newcastle, and he conducted Dr. Johnson to that town. Mr. Scott, of University College, Oxford, (now Dr. Scott, of the Commons,) accompanied him from thence to Edinburgh, With such propitious convoys did he proceed to my native city. But, lest metaphor should make it be supposed he actually went by sea, I choose to mention that he travelled in post-chaises, of which the rapid motion was one of his most favourite amusements.</p>
<p class="p24">Dr. Samuel Johnson&rsquo;s character, religious, moral, political, and literary, nay his figure and manner, are, I believe, more generally known than those of almost any man; yet it may not be superfluous here to attempt a sketch of him. Let my readers then remember that he was a sincere and zealous Christian, of high church of England and monarchical principles, which he would not tamely suffer to be questioned; steady and inflexible in maintaining the obligations of piety and virtue, both from a regard to the order of society, and from a veneration for the Great Source of all order; correct, nay stern in his taste; hard to please, and easily offended, impetuous and irritable in his temper, but of a most humane and benevolent heart; having a mind stored with a vast and various collection of learning and knowledge, which he communicated with peculiar perspicuity and force, in rich and choice expression. He united a most logical head with a most fertile imagination, which gave him an extraordinary advantage in arguing; for he could reason close or wide, as he saw best for the moment. He could, when he chose it, be the greatest sophist that ever wielded a weapon in the schools of declamation; but he indulged this only in conversation; for he owned he sometimes talked for victory; he was too conscientious to make errour permanent and pernicious, by deliberately writing it. He was conscious of his superiority. He loved praise when it was brought to him; but was too proud to seek for it. He was somewhat susceptible of flattery. His mind was so full of imagery, that he might have been perpetually a poet. It has been often remarked, that in his poetical pieces, which it is to be regretted are so few, because so excellent, his style is easier than in his prose. There is deception in this: it is not easier, but better suited to the dignity of verse; as one may dance with grace, whose motions, in ordinary walking, in the common step, are awkward. He had a constitutional melancholy, the clouds of which darkened the brightness of his fancy, and gave a gloomy cast to his whole course of thinking: yet, though grave and awful in his deportment, when he thought it necessary or proper, he frequently indulged himself in pleasantry and sportive sallies. He was prone to superstition, but not to credulity. Though his imagination might incline him to a belief of the marvellous and the mysterious, his vigorous reason examined the evidence with jealousy. He had a loud voice, and a slow deliberate utterance, which no doubt gave some additional weight to the sterling metal of his conversation. His person was large, robust, I may say approaching to the gigantick, and grown unwieldy from corpulency. His countenance was naturally of the cast of an ancient statue, but somewhat disfigured by the scars of that <span class="t8">evil</span>, which, it was formerly imagined, the <span class="t8">royal touch</span> could cure. He was now in his sixty-fourth year, and was become a little dull of hearing. His sight had always been somewhat weak; yet, so much does mind govern, and even supply the deficiency of organs, that his perceptions were uncommonly quick and accurate. His head, and sometimes also his body shook with a kind of motion like the effect of a palsy: he appeared to be frequently disturbed by cramps, or convulsive contractions, of the nature of that distemper called <span class="t8">St. Vitus&rsquo;s dance</span>. He wore a full suit of plain brown clothes, with twisted hair-buttons of the same colour, a large bushy greyish wig, a plain shirt, black worsted stockings, and silver buckles. Upon this tour, when journeying, he wore boots, and a very wide brown cloth great coat, with pockets which might have almost held the two volumes of his folio <span class="t8">Dictionary</span>; and he carried in his hand a large English oak stick. Let me not be censured for mentioning such minute particulars. Every thing relative to so great a man is worth observing. I remember Dr. Adam Smith, in his rhetorical lectures at Glasgow, told us he was glad to know that Milton wore latchets in his shoes, instead of buckles. When I mention the oak stick, it is but letting <span class="t8">Hercules</span> have his club; and, by-and-by, my readers will find this stick will bud, and produce a good joke.</p>
<p class="p24">This imperfect sketch of &lsquo;the COMBINATION and the <span class="t8">form</span>&rsquo; of that Wonderful Man, whom I venerated and loved while in this world, and after whom I gaze with humble hope, now that it has pleased ALMIGHTY GOD to call him to a better world, will serve to introduce to the fancy of my readers the capital object of the following journal, in the course of which I trust they will attain to a considerable degree of acquaintance with him.</p>
<p class="p24">His prejudice against Scotland was announced almost as soon as he began to appear in the world of Letters. In his <span class="t8">London</span>, a poem, are the following nervous lines: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;For who would leave, unbrib&rsquo;d, Hibernia&rsquo;s land?</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or change the rocks of Scotland for the Strand?</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There none are swept by sudden fate away;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But all, whom hunger spares, with age decay.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">The truth is, like the ancient Greeks and Romans, he allowed himself to look upon all nations but his own as barbarians: not only Hibernia, and Scotland, but Spain, Italy, and France, are attacked in the same poem. If he was particularly prejudiced against the Scots, it was because they were more in his way; because he thought their success in England rather exceeded the due proportion of their real merit; and because he could not but see in them that nationality which I believe no liberal-minded Scotsman will deny. He was indeed, if I may be allowed the phrase, at bottom much of a <span class="t8">John Bull</span>; much of a blunt <span class="t8">true born Englishman</span>. There was a stratum of common clay under the rock of marble. He was voraciously fond of good eating; and he had a great deal of that quality called <span class="t8">humour</span>, which gives an oiliness and a gloss to every other quality.</p>
<p class="p24">I am, I flatter myself, completely a citizen of the world. &mdash; In my travels through Holland, Germany, Switzerland, Italy, Corsica, France, I never felt myself from home; and I sincerely love &lsquo;every kindred and tongue and people and nation.&rsquo; I subscribe to what my late truly learned and philosophical friend Mr. Crosbie said, that the English are better animals than the Scots; they are nearer the sun; their blood is richer, and more mellow: but when I humour any of them in an outrageous contempt of Scotland, I fairly own I treat them as children. And thus I have, at some moments, found myself obliged to treat even Dr. Johnson.</p>
<p class="p24">To Scotland however he ventured; and he returned from it in great good humour, with his prejudices much lessened, and with very grateful feelings of the hospitality with which he was treated; as is evident from that admirable work, his <span class="t8">Journey to the Western Islands of Scotland</span>, which, to my utter astonishment, has been misapprehended, even to rancour, by many of my countrymen. To have the company of Chambers and Scott, he delayed his journey so long, that the court of session, which rises on the eleventh of August, was broke up before he got to Edinburgh.</p>
<p class="p24">On Saturday the fourteenth of August, 1773, late in the evening, I received a note from him, that he was arrived at Boyd&rsquo;s inn, at the head of the Canongate. I went to him directly. He embraced me cordially; and I exulted in the thought, that I now had him actually in Caledonia. Mr. Scott&rsquo;s amiable manners, and attachment to our <span class="t8">Socrates</span>, at once united me to him. He told me that, before I came in, the Doctor had unluckily had a bad specimen of Scottish cleanliness. He then drank no fermented liquor. He asked to have his lemonade made sweeter; upon which the waiter, with his greasy fingers, lifted a lump of sugar, and put it into it. The Doctor, in indignation, threw it out of the window. Scott said, he was afraid he would have knocked the waiter down. Mr. Johnson told me, that such another trick was played him at the house of a lady in Paris. He was to do me the honour to lodge under my roof. I regretted sincerely that I had not also a room for Mr. Scott. Mr. Johnson and I walked arm-in-arm up the High=street, to my house in James&rsquo;s court: it was a dusky night: I could not prevent his being assailed by the evening effluvia of Edinburgh. I heard a late baronet, of some distinction in the political world in the beginning of the present reign, observe, that &lsquo;walking the streets of Edinburgh at night was pretty perilous, and a good deal odoriferous.&rsquo; The peril is much abated, by the care which the magistrates have taken to enforce the city laws against throwing foul water from the windows; but from the structure of the houses in the old town, which consist of many stories, in each of which a different family lives, and there being no covered sewers, the ordour still continues. A zealous Scotsman would have wished Mr. Johnson to be without one of his five senses upon this occasion. As we marched slowly along, he grumbled in my ear, &lsquo;I smell you in the dark!&rsquo; But he acknowledged that the breadth of the street, and the loftiness of the buildings on each side made a noble appearance.</p>
<p class="p24">My wife had tea ready for him, which it is well known he delighted to drink at all hours, particularly when sitting up late, and of which his able defence against Mr. Jonas Hanway should have obtained him a magnificent reward from the East-India Company. He shewed much complacency upon finding that the mistress of the house was so attentive to his singular habit; and as no man could be more polite when he chose to be so, his address to her was most courteous and engaging; and his conversation soon charmed her into a forgetfulness of his external appearance.</p>
<p class="p24">I did not begin to keep a regular full journal till some days after we had set out from Edinburgh; but I have luckily preserved a good many fragments of his <span class="t8">Memorabilia</span> from his very first evening in Scotland.</p>
<p class="p24">We had, a little before this, had a trial for murder, in which the judges had allowed the lapse of twenty years since its commission as a plea in bar, in conformity with the doctrine of prescription in the <span class="t8">civil</span> law, which Scotland and several other countries in Europe have adopted. He at first disapproved of this; but then he thought there was something in it, if there had been for twenty years a neglect to prosecute a crime which was <span class="t8">known</span>. He would not allow that a murder, by not being <span class="t8">discovered</span> for twenty years, should escape punishment. We talked of the ancient trial by duel. He did not think it so absurd as is generally supposed; &lsquo;For (said he) it was only allowed when the question was <span class="t8">in equilibrio</span>, as when one affirmed and another denied; and they had a notion that Providence would interfere in favour of him who was in the right. But as it was found that in a duel, he who was in the right had not a better chance than he who was in the wrong, therefore society instituted the present mode of trial, and gave the advantage to him who is in the right.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">We sat till near two in the morning, having chatted a good while after my wife left us. She had insisted, that to shew all respect to the Sage she would give up her own bed-chamber to him and take a worse. This I cannot but gratefully mention, as one of a thousand obligations which I owe her, since the great obligation of her being pleased to accept of me as her husband.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">SUNDAY, AUGUST 15</span></p>
<p class="p21">Mr. Scott came to breakfast, at which I introduced to Dr. Johnson and him, my friend Sir William Forbes, now of Pitsligo; a man of whom too much good cannot be said; who, with distinguished abilities and application in his profession of a Banker, is at once a good companion, and a good christian; which I think is saying enough. Yet it is but justice to record, that once, when he was in a dangerous illness, he was watched with the anxious apprehension of a general calamity; day and night his house was beset with affectionate enquiries; and, upon his recovery, <span class="t8">Te deum</span> was the universal chorus from the <span class="t8">hearts</span> of his countrymen. Mr. Johnson was pleased with my daughter Veronica, then a child of about four months old. She had the appearance of listening to him. His motions seemed to her to be intended for her amusement; and when he stopped, she fluttered, and made a little infantine noise, and a kind of signal for him to begin again. She would be held close to him; which was a proof, from simple nature, that his figure was not horrid. Her fondness for him endeared her still more to me, and I declared she should have five hundred pounds of additional fortune.</p>
<p class="p24">We talked of the practice of the law. Sir William Forbes said, he thought an honest lawyer should never undertake a cause which he was satisfied was not a just one. &lsquo;Sir, (said Mr. Johnson,) a lawyer has no business with the justice or injustice of the cause which he undertakes, unless his client asks his opinion, and then he is bound to give it honestly. The justice or injustice of the cause is to be decided by the judge. Consider, Sir; what is the purpose of courts of justice? It is, that every man may have his cause fairly tried, by men appointed to try causes. A lawyer is not to tell what he knows to be a lie: he is not to produce what he knows to be a false deed; but he is not to usurp the province of the jury and of the judge, and determine what shall be the effect of evidence, &mdash; what shall be the result of legal argument. As it rarely happens that a man is fit to plead his own cause, lawyers are a class of the community, who, by study and experience, have acquired the art and power of arranging evidence, and of applying to the points at issue what the law has settled. A lawyer is to do for his client all that his client might fairly do for himself, if he could. If, by a superiority of attention, of knowledge, of skill, and a better method of communication, he has the advantage of his adversary, it is an advantage to which he is entitled. There must always be some advantage, on one side or other; and it is better that advantage should be had by talents than by chance. Lawyers were to undertake no causes till they were sure they were just, a man might be precluded altogether from a trial of his claim, though, were it judicially examined it might be found a very just claim.&rsquo; This was sound practical doctrine, and rationally repressed a too refined scrupulosity of conscience.</p>
<p class="p24">Emigration was at this time a common topick of discourse. Dr. Johnson regretted it as hurtful to human happiness: &lsquo;For (said he) it spreads mankind, which weakens the defence of a nation, and lessens the comfort of living. Men, thinly scattered, make a shift, but a bad shift, without many things. A smith is ten miles off: they&rsquo;ll do without a nail or a staple. A taylor is far from them: they&rsquo;ll botch their own clothes. It is being concentrated which produces high convenience.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Sir William Forbes, Mr. Scott, and I, accompanied Mr. Johnson to the chapel, founded by Lord Chief Baron Smith, for the Service of the Church of England. The Reverend Mr. Carre, the senior clergyman, preached from these words, &lsquo;Because the Lord reigneth, let the earth be glad.&rsquo; I was sorry to think Mr. Johnson did not attend to the sermon, Mr. Carre&rsquo;s low voice not being strong enough to reach his hearing. A selection of Mr. Carre&rsquo;s sermons has, since his death, been published by Sir William Forbes, and the world has acknowledged their uncommon merit. I am well assured Lord Mansfield has pronounced them to be excellent.</p>
<p class="p24">Here I obtained a promise from Lord Chief Baron Orde, that he would dine at my house next day. I presented Mr. Johnson to his Lordship, who politely said to him, I have not the honour of knowing you; but I hope for it, and to see you at my house. I am to wait on you to-morrow.&rsquo; This respectable English judge will be long remembered in Scotland, where he built an elegant house, and lived in it magnificently. His own ample fortune, with the addition of his salary, enabled him to be splendidly hospitable. It may be fortunate for an individual amongst ourselves to be Lord Chief Baron; and a most worthy man now has the office; but, in my opinion, it is better for Scotland in general, that some of our publick employments should be filled by gentlemen of distinction from the south side of the Tweed, as we have the benefit of promotion in England. Such an interchange would make a beneficial mixture of manners, and render our union more complete. Lord Chief Baron Orde was on good terms with us all, in a narrow country filled with jarring interests and keen parties; and, though I well knew his opinion to be the same with my own, he kept himself aloof at a very critical period indeed, when the <span class="t8">Douglas cause</span> shook the sacred security of <span class="t8">birthright</span> in Scotland to its foundation; a cause, which had it happened before the Union, when there was no appeal to a British House of Lords, would have left the great fortress of honours and of property in ruins. When we got home, Dr. Johnson desired to see my books. He took down Ogden&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Sermons on Prayer</span>, on which I set a very high value, having been much edified by them, and he retired with them to his room. He did not stay long, but soon joined us in the drawing room. I presented to him Mr. Robert Arbuthnot, a relation of the celebrated Dr. Arbuthnot, and a man of literature and taste. To him we were obliged for a previous recommendation, which secured us a very agreeable reception at St. Andrews, and which Dr. Johnson, in his <span class="t8">Journey</span>, ascribes to &lsquo;some invisible friend.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Of Dr. Beattie, Mr. Johnson said, &lsquo;Sir, he has written like a man conscious of the truth, and feeling his own strength. Treating your adversary with respect is giving him an advantage to which he is not entitled. The greatest part of men cannot judge of reasoning, and are impressed by character; so that, if you allow your adversary a respectable character, they will think, that though you differ from him, you may be in the wrong. Sir, treating your adversary with respect, is striking soft in a battle. And as to Hume, &mdash; a man who has so much conceit as to tell all mankind that they have been bubbled for ages, and he is the wise man who sees better than they, &mdash; a man who has so little scrupulosity as to venture to oppose those principles which have been thought necessary to human happiness, &mdash; is he to be surprized if another man comes and laughs at him? If he is the great man he thinks himself, all this cannot hurt him: it is like throwing peas against a rock.&rsquo; He added &lsquo;<span class="t8">something much too rough</span>&rsquo; both as to Mr. Hume&rsquo;s head and heart, which I suppress. Violence is, in my opinion, not suitable to the Christian cause. Besides, I always lived on good terms with Mr. Hume, though I have frankly told him, I was not clear that it was right in me to keep company with him. &lsquo;But, (said I) how much better are you than your books!&rsquo; He was cheerful, obliging, and instructive; he was charitable to the poor; and many an agreeable hour have I passed with him: I have preserved some entertaining and interesting memoirs of him, particularly when he knew himself to be dying, which I may some time or other communicate to the world. I shall not, however, extol him so very highly as Dr. Adam Smith does, who says, in a letter to Mr. Strahan the Printer (not a confidential letter to his friend, but a letter which is published with all formality:) &lsquo;Upon the whole, I have always considered him, both in his life time and since his death, as approaching as nearly to the idea of a perfectly wise and virtuous man as perhaps the nature of human frailty will permit.&rsquo; Let Dr. Smith consider: Was not Mr. Hume blest with good health, good spirits, good friends, a competent and increasing fortune? And had he not also a perpetual feast of fame? But, as a learned friend has observed to me, &lsquo;What trials did he undergo to prove the perfection of his virtue? Did he ever experience any great instance of adversity?&rsquo; &mdash; When I read this sentence delivered by my old <span class="t8">Professor of Moral Philosophy</span>, I could not help exclaiming with the <span class="t8">Psalmist</span>, &lsquo;Surely I have now more understanding than my teachers!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">While we were talking, there came a note to me from Dr. William Robertson. </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;I have been expecting every day to hear from you, of Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s</p>
<p class="p24">arrival. Pray, what do you know about his motions? I long</p>
<p class="p24">to take him by the hand. I write this from the college, where I have</p>
<p class="p24">only this scrap of paper. Ever yours,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;W. R.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Sunday.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">It pleased me to find Dr. Robertson thus eager to meet Dr. Johnson. I was glad I could answer, that he was come: and I begged Dr. Robertson might be with us as soon as he could.</p>
<p class="p24">Sir William Forbes, Mr. Scott, Mr. Arbuthnot, and another gentleman dined with us. &lsquo;Come, Dr. Johnson, (said I,) it is commonly thought that our veal in Scotland is not good. But here is some which I believe you will like.&rsquo; There was no catching him. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, what is commonly thought, I should take to be true. <span class="t8">Your</span> veal may be good; but that will only be an exception to the general opinion; not a proof against it.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Dr. Robertson, according to the custom of Edinburgh at that time, dined in the interval between the forenoon and afternoon service, which was then later than now; so we had not the pleasure of his company till dinner was over, when he came and drank wine with us. And then began some animated dialogue, of which here follows a pretty full note.</p>
<p class="p24">We talked of Mr. Burke. Dr. Johnson said, he had great variety of knowledge, store of imagery, copiousness of language. ROBERTSON. &lsquo;He has wit too.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;No, Sir; he never succeeds there. &rsquo;Tis low; &rsquo;tis conceit. I used to say, Burke never once made a good joke. What I most envy Burke for, is his being constantly the same. He is never what we call hum-drum; never unwilling to begin to talk, nor in haste to leave off.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Yet he can listen.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;No: I cannot say he is good at that. So desirous is he to talk, that, if one is speaking at this end of the table, he&rsquo;ll speak to somebody at the other end. Burke, Sir, is such a man, that if you met him for the first time in the street where you were stopped by a drove of oxen, and you and he stepped aside to take shelter but for five minutes, he&rsquo;d talk to you in such a manner, that, when you parted, you would say, this is an extraordinary man. Now, you may be long enough with me, without finding any thing extraordinary.&rsquo; He said, he believed Burke was intended for the law; but either had not money enough to follow it, or had not diligence enough. He said, he could not understand how a man could apply to one thing, and not to another. ROBERTSON said, one man had more judgment, another more imagination. JOHNSON. &lsquo;No, Sir; it is only, one man has more mind than another. He may direct it differently; he may, by accident, see the success of one kind of study, and take a desire to excel in it. I am persuaded that, had Sir Isaac Newton applied to poetry, he would have made a very fine epick poem. I could as easily apply to law as to tragick poetry.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Yet, Sir, you did apply to tragick poetry, not to law.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Because, Sir, I had not money to study law. Sir, the man who has vigour, may walk to the east, just as well as to the west, if he happens to turn his head that way.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;But, Sir, &rsquo;tis like walking up and down a hill; one man will naturally do the one better than the other. A hare will run up a hill best, from her fore-legs being short; a dog down.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Nay, Sir; that is from mechanical powers. If you make mind mechanical, you may argue in that manner. One mind is a vice, and holds fast; there&rsquo;s a good memory. Another is a file; and he is a disputant, a controversialist. Another is a razor; and he is sarcastical.&rsquo; We talked of Whitefield. He said he was at the same college with him, and knew him <span class="t8">before he began to be better than other people</span> (smiling;) that he believed he sincerely meant well, but had a mixture of politicks and ostentation: whereas Wesley thought of religion only. ROBERTSON said, Whitefield had strong natural eloquence, which, if cultivated, would have done great things. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, I take it, he was at the height of what his abilities could do, and was sensible of it. He had the ordinary advantages of education; but he chose to pursue that oratory which is for the mob.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;He had great effect on the passions.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, I don&rsquo;t think so. He could not represent a succession of pathetic images. He vociferated, and made an impression. <span class="t8">There</span>, again, was a mind like a hammer.&rsquo; Dr. Johnson now said, a certain eminent political friend of our&rsquo;s was wrong, in his maxim of sticking to a certain set of <span class="t8">men</span> on all occasions. &lsquo;I can see that a man may do right to stick to a <span class="t8">party</span> (said he;) that is to say, he is a <span class="t8">Whig</span>, or he is a <span class="t8">Tory</span>, and he thinks one of those parties upon the whole the best, and that to make it prevail, it must be generally supported, though, in particulars it may be wrong. He takes its faggot of principles, in which there are fewer rotten sticks than in the other, though some rotten sticks to be sure; and they cannot well be separated. But, to bind one&rsquo;s self to one man, or one set of men, (who may be right to-day and wrong to-morrow,) without any general preference of system, I must disapprove.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He told us of Cooke, who translated Hesiod, and lived twenty years on a translation of Plautus, for which he was always taking subscriptions; and that he presented Foote to a Club, in the following singular manner: &lsquo;This is the nephew of the gentleman who was lately hung in chains for murdering his brother.&rsquo; In the evening I introduced to Mr. Johnson two good friends of mine, Mr. William Nairne, Advocate, and Mr. Hamilton of Sundrum, my neighbour in the country, both of whom supped with us. I have preserved nothing of what passed, except that Dr. Johnson displayed another of his heterodox opinions, &mdash; a contempt of tragick acting. He said, &lsquo;the action of all players in tragedy is bad. It should be a man&rsquo;s study to repress those signs of emotion and passion, as they are called.&rsquo; He was of a directly contrary opinion to that of Fielding, in his <span class="t8">Tom Jones</span>; who makes Partridge say, of Garrick, &lsquo;why, I could act as well as he myself. I am sure, if I had seen a ghost, I should have looked in the very same manner, and done just as he did.&rsquo; For, when I asked him, &lsquo;Would you not, Sir, start as Mr. Garrick does, if you saw a ghost?&rsquo; He answered, &lsquo;I hope not. If I did, I should frighten the ghost.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">MONDAY, AUGUST 16.</span></p>
<p class="p21">Dr. William Robertson came to breakfast. We talked of <span class="t8">Ogden on Prayer</span>. Dr. Johnson said, &lsquo;The same arguments which are used against GOD&rsquo;S hearing prayer, will serve against his rewarding good, and punishing evil. He has resolved, he has declared, in the former case as in the latter.&rsquo; He had last night looked into Lord Hailes&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Remarks on the History of Scotland</span>. Dr. Robertson and I said, it was a pity Lord Hailes did not write greater things. His lordship had not then published his <span class="t8">Annals of Scotland</span>. JOHNSON. &lsquo;I remember I was once on a visit at the house of a lady for whom I had a high respect. There was a good deal of company in the room. When they were gone, I said to this lady, &ldquo;What foolish talking have we had!&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, (said she,) but while they talked, you said nothing.&rdquo; I was struck with the reproof. How much better is the man who does anything that is innocent, than he who does nothing. Besides, I love anecdotes. I fancy mankind may come, in time, to write all aphoristically, except in narrative; grow weary of preparation, and connection, and illustration, and all those arts by which a big book is made. If a man is to wait till he weaves anecdotes into a system, we may be long in getting them, and get but few, in comparison of what we might get.</p>
<p class="p24">Dr. Robertson said, the notions of <span class="t8">Eupham Macallan</span>, a fanatick woman, of whom Lord Hailes gives a sketch, were still prevalent among some of the Presbyterians; and therefore it was right in Lord Hailes, a man of known piety, to undeceive them.</p>
<p class="p24">We walked out, that Dr. Johnson might see some of the things which we have to shew at Edinburgh. We went to the Parliament-House, where the Parliament of Scotland sat, and where the <span class="t8">Ordinary Lords</span> of Session hold their courts; and to the New Session-House adjoining to it, where our Court of Fifteen (the fourteen <span class="t8">Ordinaries</span>, with the Lord President at their head,) sit as a court of Review. We went to the <span class="t8">Advocates Library</span>, of which Dr. Johnson took a cursory view, and then to what is called the <span class="t8">Laigh</span> (or under) Parliament-House, where the records of Scotland, which has an universal security by register, are deposited, till the great Register Office be finished. I was pleased to behold Dr. Samuel Johnson rolling about in this old magazine of antiquities. There was, by this time, a pretty numerous circle of us attending upon him. Somebody talked of happy moments for composition; and how a man can write at one time, and not at another. &lsquo;Nay, (said Dr. Johnson,) a man may write at any time, if he will set himself <span class="t8">doggedly</span> to it.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I here began to indulge <span class="t8">old Scottish</span> sentiments, and to express a warm regret, that, by our Union with <span class="t8">England</span>, we were no more; &mdash; our independent kingdom was lost. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, never talk of your independency, who could let your Queen remain twenty years in captivity, and then be put to death, without even a pretence of justice, without your ever attempting to rescue her; and such a Queen too; as every man of any gallantry of spirit would have sacrificed his life for.&rsquo; Worthy Mr. JAMES KERR, Keeper of the Records. &lsquo;Half our nation was bribed by English money.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, that is no defence: that makes you worse.&rsquo; Good Mr. BROWN, Keeper of the Advocates&rsquo; Library. &lsquo;We had better say nothing about it.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;You would have been glad, however, to have had us last war, sir, to fight your battles!&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;We should have had you for the same price, though there had been no Union, as we might have had Swiss, or other troops. No, no, I shall agree to a separation. You have only to <span class="t8">go home</span>.&rsquo; Just as he had said this, I, to divert the subject, shewed him the signed assurances of the three successive Kings of the Hanover family, to maintain the Presbyterian establishment in Scotland. &lsquo;We&rsquo;ll give you that (said he) into the bargain.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">We next went to the great church of St. Giles, which has lost its original magnificence in the inside, by being divided into four places of Presbyterian worship. &lsquo;Come, (said Dr. Johnson jocularly to Principal Robertson,) let me see what was once a church!&rsquo; We entered that division which was formerly called the <span class="t8">New Church</span>, and of late the <span class="t8">High Church</span>, so well known by the eloquence of Dr. Hugh Blair. It is now very elegantly fitted up; but it was then shamefully dirty. Dr. Johnson said nothing at the time; but when we came to the great door of the Royal Infirmary, where upon a board was this inscription, &lsquo;<span class="t8">Clean your feet!</span>&rsquo; he turned about slyly and said, &lsquo;There is no occasion for putting this at the doors of your churches!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">We then conducted him down the Post-house stairs, Parliament-close, and made him look up from the Cow-gate to the highest building in Edinburgh, (from which he had just descended,) being thirteen floors or stories from the ground upon the back elevation; the front wall being built upon the edge of the hill, and the back wall rising from the bottom of the hill several stories before it comes to a level with the front wall. We proceeded to the College, with the Principal at our head. Dr. Adam Fergusson, whose <span class="t8">Essay on the History of Civil Society</span> gives him a respectable place in the ranks of literature, was with us. As the College buildings are indeed very mean, the Principal said to Dr. Johnson, that he must give them the same epithet that a Jesuit did when shewing a poor college abroad: &lsquo;<span class="t8">Hae miseriae nostrae</span>.&rsquo; Dr. Johnson was, however, much pleased with the library, and with the conversation of Dr. James Robertson, Professor of Oriental Languages, the Librarian. We talked of Kennicot&rsquo;s edition of the Hebrew Bible, and hoped it would be quite faithful. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, I know not any crime so great that a man could contrive to commit, as poisoning the sources of eternal truth.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I pointed out to him where there formerly stood an old wall enclosing part of the college, which I remember bulged out in a threatening manner, and of which there was a common tradition similar to that concerning <span class="t8">Bacon&rsquo;s</span> study at Oxford, that it would fall upon some very learned man. It had some time before this been taken down, that the street might be widened, and a more convenient wall built. Dr. Johnson, glad of an opportunity to have a pleasant hit at Scottish learning, said, &lsquo;they have been afraid it never would fall.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">We shewed him the Royal Infirmary, for which, and for every other exertion of generous publick spirit in his power, that noble-minded citizen of Edinburgh, George Drummond, will be ever held in honourable remembrance. And we were too proud not to carry him to the Abbey of Holyrood-house, that beautiful piece of architecture, but, alas! that deserted mansion of royalty, which Hamilton of Bangour, in one of his elegant poems, calls </p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;A virtuous palace, where no monarch dwells.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I was much entertained while Principal Robertson fluently harangued to Dr. Johnson, upon the spot, concerning scenes of his celebrated <span class="t8">History of Scotland</span>. We surveyed that part of the palace appropriated to the Duke of Hamilton, as Keeper, in which our beautiful Queen Mary lived, and in which David Rizzio was murdered; and also the State Rooms. Dr. Johnson was a great reciter of all sorts of things serious or comical. I overheard him repeating here in a kind of muttering tone, a line of the old ballad, <span class="t8">Johnny Armstrong&rsquo;s Last Good Night</span>: </p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;And ran him through the fair body!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">We returned to my house, where there met him, at dinner, the Duchess of Douglas, Sir Adolphus Oughton, Lord Chief Baron, Sir William Forbes, Principal Robertson, Mr. Cullen, Advocate. Before dinner he told us of a curious conversation between the famous George Faulkner and him. George said that England had drained Ireland of fifty thousand pounds in specie, annually, for fifty years. &lsquo;How so, Sir! (said Dr. Johnson,) you must have a very great trade?&rsquo; &lsquo;No trade.&rsquo; &lsquo;Very rich mines?&rsquo; &lsquo;No mines.&rsquo; &lsquo;From whence, then, does all this money come?&rsquo; &lsquo;Come! why out of the blood and bowels of the poor people of Ireland!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He seemed to me to have an unaccountable prejudice against Swift; for I once took the liberty to ask him, if Swift had personally offended him, and he told me he had not. He said to-day, &lsquo;Swift is clear, but he is shallow. In coarse humour, he is inferior to Arbuthnot; in delicate humour, he is inferior to Addison. So he is inferior to his contemporaries; without putting him against the whole world. I doubt if the <span class="t8">Tale of a Tub</span> was his: it has so much more thinking, more knowledge, more power, more colour, than any of the works which are indisputably his. If it was his, I shall only say, he was <span class="t8">impar sibi</span>.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">We gave him as good a dinner as we could. Our Scotch muir-fowl, or growse, were then abundant, and quite in season; and so far as wisdom and wit can be aided by administering agreeable sensations to the palate, my wife took care that our great guest should not be deficient.</p>
<p class="p24">Sir Adolphus Oughton, then our Deputy Commander in Chief, who was not only an excellent officer, but one of the most universal scholars I ever knew, had learned the Erse language, and expressed his belief in the authenticity of Ossian&rsquo;s Poetry. Dr. Johnson took the opposite side of that perplexed question; and I was afraid the dispute would have run high between them. But Sir Adolphus, who had a very sweet temper, changed the discourse, grew playful, laughed at Lord Monboddo&rsquo;s notion of men having tails, and called him a Judge, <span class="t8">à posteriori</span>, which amused Dr. Johnson; and thus hostilities were prevented.</p>
<p class="p24">At supper we had Dr. Cullen, his son the advocate, Dr. Adam Fergusson, and Mr. Crosbie, advocate. Witchcraft was introduced. Mr. Crosbie said, he thought it the greatest blasphemy to suppose evil spirits counteracting the Deity, and raising storms, for instance, to destroy his creatures. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, if moral evil be consistent with the government of the Deity, why may not physical evil be also consistent with it? It is not more strange that there should be evil spirits, than evil men: evil unembodied spirits, than evil embodied spirits. And as to storms, we know there are such things; and it is no worse that evil spirits raise them, than that they rise.&rsquo; CROSBIE. &lsquo;But it is not credible, that witches should have effected what they are said in stories to have done.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, I am not defending their credibility. I am only saying, that your arguments are not good, and will not overturn the belief of witchcraft. &mdash; (Dr. Fergusson said to me, aside, &lsquo;He is right.&rsquo;) &mdash; And then, Sir, you have all mankind, rude and civilized, agreeing in the belief of the agency of preternatural powers. You must take evidence: you must consider, that wise and great men have condemned witches to die.&rsquo; CROSBIE. &lsquo;But an act of parliament put an end to witchcraft.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;No, Sir; witchcraft had ceased; and therefore an act of parliament was passed to prevent persecution for what was not witchcraft. Why it ceased, we cannot tell, as we cannot tell the reason of many other things.&rsquo; &mdash; Dr. Cullen, to keep up the gratification of mysterious disquisition, with the grave address for which he is remarkable in his companionable as in his professional hours, talked, in a very entertaining manner, of people walking and conversing in their sleep. I am very sorry I have no note of this. We talked of the <span class="t8">Ouran-Outang</span>, and of Lord Monboddo&rsquo;s thinking that he might be taught to speak. Dr. Johnson treated this with ridicule. Mr. Crosbie said, that Lord Monboddo believed the existence of every thing possible; in short, that all which is in <span class="t8">posse</span> might be found in <span class="t8">esse</span>. JOHNSON. &lsquo;But, Sir, it is as possible that the <span class="t8">Ouran-Outang</span> does not speak, as that he speaks. However, I shall not contest the point. I should have thought it not possible to find a Monboddo; yet <span class="t8">he</span> exists.&rsquo; I again mentioned the stage. JOHNSON. &lsquo;The appearance of a player, with whom I have drunk tea, counteracts the imagination that he is the character he represents. Nay, you know, nobody imagines that he is the character he represents. They say, &ldquo;See <span class="t8">Garrick!</span> how he looks to night! See how he&rsquo;ll clutch the dagger!&rdquo; That is the buz of the theatre.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">TUESDAY, AUGUST 17.</span></p>
<p class="p21">Sir William Forbes came to breakfast, and brought with him Dr. Blacklock, whom he introduced to Dr. Johnson, who received him with a most humane complacency; &lsquo;Dear Dr. Blacklock, I am glad to see you!&rsquo; Blacklock seemed to be much surprized, when Dr. Johnson said, &lsquo;it was easier to him to write poetry than to compose his <span class="t8">Dictionary</span>. His mind was less on the stretch in doing the one than the other. Besides; composing a <span class="t8">Dictionary</span> requires books and a desk: you can make a poem walking in the fields, or lying in bed. Dr. Blacklock spoke of scepticism in morals and religion, with apparent uneasiness, as if he wished for more certainty. Dr. Johnson, who had thought it all over, and whose vigorous understanding was fortified by much experience, thus encouraged the blind Bard to apply to higher speculations what we all willingly submit to in common life: in short, he gave him more familiarly the able and fair reasoning of Butler&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Analogy</span>: &lsquo;Why, Sir, the greatest concern we have in this world, the choice of our profession, must be determined without demonstrative reasoning. Human life is not yet so well known, as that we can have it. And take the case of a man who is ill. I call two physicians: they differ in opinion. I am not to lie down, and die between them: I must do something.&rsquo; The conversation then turned on Atheism; on that horrible book, <span class="t8">Système de la Nature</span>; and on the supposition of an eternal necessity, without design, without a governing mind. JOHNSON. &lsquo;If it were so, why has it ceased? Why don&rsquo;t we see men thus produced around us now? Why, at least, does it not keep pace, in some measure, with the progress of time? If it stops because there is now no need of it, then it is plain there is, and ever has been, an all powerful intelligence. But stay! (said he, with one of his satyrick laughs.) Ha! ha! ha! I shall suppose Scotchmen made necessarily, and Englishmen by choice.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">At dinner this day, we had Sir Alexander Dick, whose amiable character, and ingenious and cultivated mind, are so generally known; (he was then on the verge of seventy, and is now (1785) eighty-one, with his faculties entire, his heart warm, and his temper gay;) Sir David Dalrymple, Lord Hailes; Mr. Maclaurin, advocate; Dr. Gregory, who now worthily fills his father&rsquo;s medical chair; and my uncle, Dr. Boswell. This was one of Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s best days. He was quite in his element. All was literature and taste, without any interruption. Lord Hailes, who is one of the best philologists in Great Britain, who has written papers in <span class="t8">The World</span>, and a variety of other works in prose and in verse, both Latin and English, pleased him highly. He told him, he had discovered the life of <span class="t8">Cheynel</span>, in <span class="t8">The Student</span>, to be his. JOHNSON. &lsquo;No one else knows it.&rsquo; Dr. Johnson had, before this, dictated to me a law-paper, upon a question purely in the law of Scotland, concerning <span class="t8">vicious intromission</span>, that is to say, intermeddling with the effects of a deceased person, without a regular title; which formerly was understood to subject the intermeddler to payment of all the defunct&rsquo;s debts. The principle has of late been relaxed. Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s argument was, for a renewal of its strictness. The paper was printed, with additions by me, and given into the Court of Session. Lord Hailes knew Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s part not to be mine, and pointed out exactly where it began, and where it ended. Dr. Johnson said, &lsquo;It is much, now, that his lordship can distinguish so.&rsquo; In Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Vanity of Human Wishes</span>, there is the following passage: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;The teeming mother, anxious for her race,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Begs, for each birth, the fortune of a face:</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet <span class="t8">Vane</span> could tell, what ills from beauty spring,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And <span class="t8">Sedley</span> curs&rsquo;d the charms which pleas&rsquo;d a king.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Lord Hailes told him, he was mistaken in the instances he had given of unfortunate fair ones; for neither <span class="t8">Vane</span> nor <span class="t8">Sedley</span> had a title to that description. His Lordship has since been so obliging as to send me a note of this, for the communication of which I am sure my readers will thank me.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The lines in the tenth Satire of Juvenal, according to my alteration, should have run thus: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Yet <span class="t8">Shore</span> could tell &mdash;&mdash; ;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And <span class="t8">Valiere</span> curs&rsquo;d &mdash;&mdash;&nbsp; &mdash; .&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The first was a penitent by compulsion, the second by sentiment; though the truth is, Mademoiselle de la Valiere threw herself (but still from sentiment) in the King&rsquo;s way.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Our friend chose <span class="t8">Vane</span>, who was far from being well-looked; and <span class="t8">Sedley</span>, who was so ugly, that Charles II. said, his brother had her by way of penance.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Mr. Maclaurin&rsquo;s learning and talents enabled him to do his part very well in Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s company. He produced two epitaphs upon his father, the celebrated mathematician. One was in English, of which Dr. Johnson did not change one word. In the other, which was in Latin, he made several alterations. In place of the very words of <span class="t8">Virgil</span>, &lsquo;<span class="t8">Ubi luctus et pavor et plurima mortis imago</span>,&rsquo; he wrote &lsquo;<span class="t8">Ubi luctus regnant et pavor</span>.&rsquo; He introduced the word <span class="t8">prorsus</span> into the line &lsquo;<span class="t8">Mortalibus prorsus non absit solatium</span>,&rsquo; and after &lsquo;<span class="t8">Hujus enim scripta evolve</span>,&rsquo; he added &lsquo;<span class="t8">Mentemque tantarum rerum capacem corpori caduco superstitem crede</span>;&rsquo; which is quite applicable to Dr. Johnson himself.</p>
<p class="p24">Mr. Murray, advocate, who married a niece of Lord Mansfield&rsquo;s, and is now one of the judges of Scotland, by the title of Lord <span class="t8">Henderland</span>, sat with us a part of the evening; but did not venture to say any thing, that I remember, though he is certainly possessed of talents which would have enabled him to have shewn himself to advantage, if too great anxiety had not prevented him.</p>
<p class="p24">At supper we had Dr. Alexander Webster, who, though not, learned, had such a knowledge of mankind, such a fund of information and entertainment, so clear a head and such accommodating manners, that Dr. Johnson found him a very agreeable companion.</p>
<p class="p24">When Dr. Johnson and I were left by ourselves, I read to him my notes of the Opinions of our Judges upon the questions of Literary Property. He did not like them; and said, &lsquo;they make me think of your Judges not with that respect which I should wish to do.&rsquo; To the argument of one of them, that there can be no property in blasphemy or nonsense, he answered, &lsquo;then your rotten sheep are mine! By that rule, when a man&rsquo;s house falls into decay, he must lose it.&rsquo; I mentioned an argument of mine, that literary performances are not taxed. As <span class="t8">Churchill</span> says, </p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;No statesman yet has thought it worth his pains</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To tax our labours, or excise our brains;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">and therefore they are not property. &lsquo;Yet, (said he,) we hang a man for stealing a horse, and horses are not taxed.&rsquo; Mr. Pitt has since put an end to that argument.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 18.</span></p>
<p class="p21">On this day we set out from Edinburgh. We should gladly have had Mr. Scott to go with us; but he was obliged to return to England. &mdash; I have given a sketch of Dr. Johnson: my readers may wish to know a little of his fellow traveller. Think then, of a gentleman of ancient blood, the pride of which was his predominant passion. He was then in his thirty-third year, and had been about four years happily married. His inclination was to be a soldier; but his father, a respectable Judge, had pressed him into the profession of the law. He had travelled a good deal, and seen many varieties of human life. He had thought more than any body supposed, and had a pretty good stock of general learning and knowledge. He had all Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s principles, with some degree of relaxation. He had rather too little, than too much prudence; and, his imagination being lively, he often said things of which the effect was very different from the intention. He resembled sometimes </p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;The best good man, with the worst natur&rsquo;d muse.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He cannot deny himself the vanity of finishing with the encomium of Dr. Johnson, whose friendly partiality to the companion of his Tour represents him as one &lsquo;whose acuteness would help my enquiry, and whose gaiety of conversation, and civility of manners, are sufficient to counteract the inconveniences of travel, in countries less hospitable than we have passed.&rsquo; Dr. Johnson thought it unnecessary to put himself to the additional expence of bringing with him Francis Barber, his faithful black servant; so we were attended only by my man, Joseph Ritter, a Bohemian; a fine stately fellow above six feet high, who had been over a great part of Europe, and spoke many languages. He was the best servant I ever saw. Let not my readers disdain his introduction! For Dr. Johnson gave him this character: &lsquo;Sir, he is a civil man, and a wise man.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">From an erroneous apprehension of violence, Dr. Johnson had provided a pair of pistols, some gunpowder, and a quantity of bullets: but upon being assured we should run no risk of meeting any robbers, he left his arms and ammunition in an open drawer, of which he gave my wife the charge. He also left in that drawer one volume of a pretty full and curious Diary of his Life, of which I have a few fragments; but the book has been destroyed. I wish female curiosity had been strong enough to have had it all transcribed; which might easily have been done; and I should think the theft, being <span class="t8">pro bono publico</span>, might have been forgiven. But I may be wrong. My wife told me she never once looked into it. &mdash; She did not seem quite easy when we left her: but away we went!</p>
<p class="p24">Mr. Nairne, advocate, was to go with us as far as St. Andrews. It gives me pleasure that, by mentioning his <span class="t8">name</span>, I connect his title to the just and handsome compliment paid him by Dr. Johnson, in his book: &lsquo;A gentleman who could stay with us only long enough to make us know how much we lost by his leaving us. &lsquo;When we came to Leith, I talked with perhaps too boasting an air, how pretty the Frith of Forth looked; as indeed, after the prospect from Constantinople, of which I have been told, and that from Naples, which I have seen, I believe the view of that Frith and its environs, from the Castle-hill of Edinburgh, is the finest prospect in Europe. &lsquo;Ay, (said Dr. Johnson,) that is the state of the world. Water is the same every where. </p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Una est injusti caerula forma maris.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I told him the port here was the mouth of the river or water of <span class="t8">Leith</span>. &lsquo;Not <span class="t8">Lethe</span>; said Mr. Nairne. &lsquo;Why, Sir, (said Dr. Johnson,) when a Scotchman sets out from this port for England, he forgets his native country.&rsquo; NAIRNE. &lsquo;I hope, Sir, you will forget England here.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Then &lsquo;twill still be more <span class="t8">Lethe</span>&rsquo; He observed of the Pier or Quay, &lsquo;you have no occasion for so large a one: your trade does not require it: but you are like a shopkeeper who takes a shop, not only for what he has to put in it, but that it may be believed he has a great deal to put into it.&rsquo; It is very true, that there is now, comparatively, little trade upon the eastern coast of Scotland. The riches of Glasgow shew how much there is in the west; and perhaps we shall find trade travel westward on a great scale, as well as a small.</p>
<p class="p24">We talked of a man&rsquo;s drowning himself. JOHNSON. &lsquo;I should never think it time to make away with myself.&rsquo; I put the case of Eustace Budgell, who was accused of forging a will, and sunk himself in the Thames, before the trial of its authenticity came on. &lsquo;Suppose, Sir, (said I,) that a man is absolutely sure, that, if he lives a few days longer, he shall be detected in a fraud, the consequence of which will be utter disgrace and expulsion from society.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Then, Sir, let him go abroad to a distant country; let him go to some place where he is <span class="t8">not</span> known. Don&rsquo;t let him go to the devil where he <span class="t8">is</span> known!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He then said, &lsquo;I see a number of people bare-footed here: I suppose you all went so before the Union. Boswell, your ancestors went so, when they had as much land as your family has now. Yet <span class="t8">Auchinleck</span> is the <span class="t8">Field of Stones</span>: there would be bad going bare-footed there. The <span class="t8">Lairds</span>, however, did it.&rsquo; I bought some <span class="t8">speldings</span>, fish (generally whitings) salted and dried in a particular manner, being dipped in the sea and dried in the sun, and eaten by the Scots by way of a relish. He had never seen them, though they are sold in London. I insisted on <span class="t8">scottifying</span> his palate; but he was very reluctant. With difficulty I prevailed with him to let a bit of one of them lie in his mouth. He did not like it.</p>
<p class="p24">In crossing the Frith, Dr. Johnson determined that we should land upon Inch Keith. On approaching it, we first observed a high rocky shore. We coasted about, and put into a little bay on the North-west. We clambered up a very steep ascent, on which was very good grass, but rather a profusion of thistles. There were sixteen head of black cattle grazing upon the island. Lord Hailes observed to me, that Brantome calls it <span class="t8">L&rsquo;isle des Chevaux</span>, and that it was probably &lsquo;a <span class="t8">safer</span> stable&rsquo; than many others in his time. The fort, with an inscription on it, <span class="t8">Maria Re</span> 1564, is strongly built. Dr. Johnson examined it with much attention. He stalked like a giant among the luxuriant thistles and nettles. There are three wells in the island; but we could not find one in the fort. There must probably have been one, though now filled up, as a garrison could not subsist without it. But I have dwelt too long on this little spot. Dr. Johnson afterwards bade me try to write a description of our discovering Inch Keith, in the usual style of travellers, describing fully every particular; stating the grounds on which we concluded that it must have once been inhabited, and introducing many sage reflections; and we should see how a thing might be covered in words, so as to induce people to come and survey it. All that was told might be true, and yet in reality there might be nothing to see. He said, &lsquo;I&rsquo;d have this island. I&rsquo;d build a house, make a good landing-place, have a garden, and vines, and all sorts of trees. A rich man, of a hospitable turn, here, would have many visitors from Edinburgh.&rsquo; When we got into our boat again, he called to me, &lsquo;Come, now, pay a classical compliment to the island on quitting it.&rsquo; I happened luckily, in allusion to the beautiful Queen Mary, whose name is upon the fort, to think of what Virgil makes Aeneas say, on having left the country of his charming Dido. </p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Invitus, regina, tuo de littore cessi.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Very well hit off!&rsquo; said he.</p>
<p class="p24">We dined at Kinghorn, and then got into a post-chaise. Mr. Nairne and his servant, and Joseph, rode by us. We stopped at Cupar, and drank tea. We talked of parliament; and I said, I supposed very few of the members knew much of what was going on, as indeed very few gentlemen know much of their own private affairs. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, if a man is not of a sluggish mind, he may be his own steward. If he will look into his affairs, he will soon learn. So it is as to publick affairs. There must always be a certain number of men of business in parliament.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;But consider, Sir; what is the House of Commons? Is not a great part of it chosen by peers? Do you think, Sir, they ought to have such an influence?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Yes, Sir. Influence must ever be in proportion to property; and it is right it should.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;But is there not reason to fear that the common people may be oppressed?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;No, Sir. Our great fear is from want of power in government. Such a storm of vulgar force has broke in.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;It has only roared.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, it has roared, till the Judges in Westminster-Hall have been afraid to pronounce sentence in opposition to the popular cry. You are frightened by what is no longer dangerous, like Presbyterians by Popery.&rsquo; He then repeated a passage, I think, in <span class="t8">Butler&rsquo;s Remains</span>, which ends, &lsquo;and would cry, Fire! Fire! in Noah&rsquo;s flood.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">We had a dreary drive, in a dusky night, to St. Andrews, where we arrived late. We found a good supper at Glass&rsquo;s inn, and Dr. Johnson revived agreeably. He said, &lsquo;the collection called <span class="t8">The Muses&rsquo; Welcome to King James</span>, (first of England, and sixth of Scotland,) on his return to his native kingdom, shewed that there was then abundance of learning in Scotland; and that the conceits in that collection, with which people find fault, were mere mode.&rsquo; He added, &lsquo;we could not now entertain a sovereign so; that Buchanan had spread the spirit of learning amongst us, but we had lost it during the civil wars.&rsquo; He did not allow the Latin Poetry of Pitcairne so much merit as has been usually attributed to it; though he owned that one of his pieces, which he mentioned, but which I am sorry is not specified in my notes, was, &lsquo;very well.&rsquo; It is not improbable that it was the poem which Prior has so elegantly translated.</p>
<p class="p24">After supper, we made a <span class="t8">procession</span> to <span class="t8">Saint Leonard&rsquo;s College</span>, the landlord walking before us with a candle, and the waiter with a lantern. That college had some time before been dissolved; and Dr. Watson, a professor here, (the historian of Philip II.) had purchased the ground, and what buildings remained. When we entered this court, it seemed quite academical; and we found in his house very comfortable and genteel accommodation.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">THURSDAY, AUGUST 19.</span></p>
<p class="p21">We rose much refreshed. I had with me a map of Scotland, a bible which was given me by Lord Mountstuart when we were together in Italy, and Ogden&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Sermons on Prayer</span>; Mr. Nairne introduced us to Dr. Watson, whom we found a well-informed man, of very amiable manners. Dr. Johnson, after they were acquainted, said, &lsquo;I take great delight in him.&rsquo; His daughter, a very pleasing young lady, made breakfast. Dr. Watson observed, that Glasgow University had fewer home-students, since trade increased, as learning was rather incompatible with it. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, as trade is now carried on by subordinate hands, men in trade have as much leisure as others; and now learning itself is a trade. A man goes to a bookseller, and gets what he can. We have done with patronage. In the infancy of learning, we find some great man praised for it. This diffused it among others. When it becomes general, an authour leaves the great, and applies to the multitude.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;It is a shame that authours are not now better patronized.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;No, Sir. If learning cannot support a man, if he must sit with his hands across till somebody feeds him, it is as to him a bad thing, and it is better as it is. With patronage, what flattery! what falsehood! While a man is in equilibrio, he throws truth among the multitude, and lets them take it as they please: in patronage, he must say what pleases his patron, and it is an equal chance whether that be truth or falsehood.&rsquo; WATSON. &lsquo;But is not the case now, that, instead of flattering one person, we flatter the age?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;No, Sir. The world always lets a man tell what he thinks, his own way. I wonder, however, that so many people have written, who might have let it alone. That people should endeavour to excel in conversation, I do not wonder; because in conversation praise is instantly reverberated.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">We talked of change of manners. Dr. Johnson observed, that our drinking less than our ancestors was owing to the change from ale to wine.&rsquo; I remember, (said he,) when all the <span class="t8">decent</span> people in Lichfield got drunk every night, and were not the worse thought of. Ale was cheap, so you pressed strongly. When a man must bring a bottle of wine, he is not in such haste. Smoking has gone out. To be sure, it is a shocking thing, blowing smoke out of our mouths into other people&rsquo;s mouths, eyes, and noses, and having the same thing done to us. Yet I cannot account, why a thing which requires so little exertion, and yet preserves the mind from total vacuity, should have gone out. Every man has something by which he calms himself: beating with his feet, or so. I remember when people in England changed a shirt only once a week: a Pandour, when he gets a shirt, greases it to make it last. Formerly, good tradesmen had no fire but in the kitchen; never in the parlour, except on Sunday. My father, who was a magistrate of Lichfield, lived thus. They never began to have a fire in the parlour, but on leaving off business, or some great revolution of their life.&rsquo; Dr. Watson said, the hall was as a kitchen, in old squires&rsquo; houses. JOHNSON. &lsquo;No, Sir. The hall was for great occasions, and never was used for domestick refection.&rsquo; We talked of the Union, and what money it had brought into Scotland. Dr. Watson observed, that a little money formerly went as far as a great deal now. JOHNSON. &lsquo;In speculation, it seems that a smaller quantity of money, equal in value to a larger quantity, if equally divided, should produce the same effect. But it is not so in reality. Many more conveniences and elegancies are enjoyed where money is plentiful, than where it is scarce. Perhaps a great familiarity with it, which arises from plenty, makes us more easily part with it.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">After what Dr. Johnson had said of St. Andrews, which he had long wished to see, as our oldest university, and the seat of our Primate in the days of episcopacy, I can say little. Since the publication of Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s book, I find that he has been censured for not seeing here the ancient chapel of <span class="t8">St. Rule</span>, a curious piece of sacred architecture. But this was neither his fault nor mine. We were both of us abundantly desirous of surveying such sort of antiquities: but neither of us knew of this. I am afraid the censure must fall on those who did not tell us of it. In every place, where there is any thing worthy of observation, there should be a short printed directory for strangers, such as we find in all the towns of Italy, and in some of the towns in England. I was told that there is a manuscript account of St. Andrews, by Martin, secretary to Archbishop Sharp; and that one Douglas has published a small account of it. I inquired at a bookseller&rsquo;s, but could not get it. Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s veneration for the Hierarchy is well known. There is no wonder then, that he was affected with a strong indignation, while he beheld the ruins of religious magnificence. I happened to ask where John Knox was buried. Dr. Johnson burst out, &lsquo;I hope in the high-way. I have been looking at his reformations.&rsquo; It was a very fine day. Dr. Johnson seemed quite wrapt up in the contemplation of the scenes which were now presented to him. He kept his hat off while he was upon any part of the ground where the cathedral had stood. He said well, that &lsquo;Knox had set on a mob, without knowing where it would end; and that differing from a man in doctrine was no reason why you should pull his house about his ears.&rsquo; As we walked in the cloisters, there was a solemn echo, while he talked loudly of a proper retirement from the world. Mr. Nairne said, he had an inclination to retire. I called Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s attention to this, that I might hear his opinion if it was right. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Yes, when he has done his duty to society. In general, as every man is obliged not only to &ldquo;love GOD, but his neighbour as himself,&rdquo; he must bear his part in active life; yet there are exceptions. Those who are exceedingly scrupulous, (which I do not approve, for I am no friend to scruples,) and find their scrupulosity invincible, so that they are quite in the dark, and know not what they shall do, &mdash; or those who cannot resist temptations, and find they make themselves worse by being in the world, without making it better, may retire. I never read of a hermit, but in imagination I kiss his feet; never of a monastery, but I could fall on my knees, and kiss the pavement. But I think putting young people there, who know nothing of life, nothing of retirement, is dangerous and wicked. It is a saying as old as Hesiod, </p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Erga neon, boulaite meson, enchaite geronton.</p>
<p class="p24">That is a very noble line: not that young men should not pray, or old men not give counsel, but that every season of life has its proper duties. I have thought of retiring, and have talked of it to a friend; but I find my vocation is rather to active life.&rsquo; I said, some young monks might be allowed, to shew that it is not age alone that can retire to pious solitude; but he thought this would only shew that they could not resist temptation.</p>
<p class="p24">He wanted to mount the steeples, but it could not be done. There are no good inscriptions here. Bad Roman characters he naturally mistook for half Gothick, half Roman. One of the steeples, which he was told was in danger, he wished not to be taken down; &lsquo;for, said he, it may fall on some of the posterity of John Knox; and no great matter!&rsquo; &mdash; Dinner was mentioned. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Ay, ay; amidst all these sorrowful scenes, I have no objection to dinner.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">We went and looked at the castle, where Cardinal Beaton was murdered, and then visited Principal Murison at his college, where is a good library-room; but the Principal was abundantly vain of it, for he seriously said to Dr. Johnson, &lsquo;you have not such a one in England.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">The professors entertained us with a very good dinner. Present: Murison, Shaw, Cook, Hill, Haddo, Watson, Flint, Brown. I observed, that I wondered to see him eat so well, after viewing so many sorrowful scenes of ruined religious magnificence. &lsquo;Why, said he, I am not sorry, after seeing these gentlemen; for they are not sorry.&rsquo; Murison said, all sorrow was bad, as it was murmuring against the dispensations of Providence. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, sorrow is inherent in humanity. As you cannot judge two and two to be either five, or three, but certainly four, so, when comparing a worse present state with a better which is past, you cannot but feel sorrow. It is not cured by reason, but by the incursion of present objects, which wear out the past. You need not murmur, though you are sorry.&rsquo; MURISON. &lsquo;But St. Paul says, &ldquo;I have learnt, in whatever state I am, therewith to be content.&rdquo;&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, that relates to riches and poverty; for we see St. Paul, when he had a thorn in the flesh, prayed earnestly to have it removed; and then he could not be content.&rsquo; Murison, thus refuted, tried to be smart, and drank to Dr. Johnson, &lsquo;Long may you lecture!&rsquo; Dr. Johnson afterwards, speaking of his not drinking wine, said, &lsquo;The Doctor spoke of <span class="t8">lecturing</span> (looking to him). I give all these lectures on water.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He defended requiring subscription in those admitted to universities, thus: &lsquo;As all who come into the country must obey the king, so all who come into an university must be of the church.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">And here I must do Dr. Johnson the justice to contradict a very absurd and ill-natured story, as to what passed at St. Andrews. It has been circulated, that, after grace was said in English, in the usual manner, he with the greatest marks of contempt, as if he had held it to be no grace in an university, would not sit down till he had said grace aloud in Latin. This would have been an insult indeed to the gentlemen who were entertaining us. But the truth was precisely thus. In the course of conversation at dinner, Dr. Johnson, in very good humour, said, &lsquo;I should have expected to have heard a Latin grace, among so many learned men: we had always a Latin grace at Oxford. I believe I can repeat it.&rsquo; Which he did, as giving the learned men in one place a specimen of what was done by the learned men in another place.</p>
<p class="p24">We went and saw the church, in which is Archbishop Sharp&rsquo;s monument. I was struck with the same kind of feelings with which the churches of Italy impressed me. I was much pleased, to see Dr. Johnson actually in St. Andrews, of which we had talked so long. Professor Haddo was with us this afternoon, along with Dr. Watson. We looked at St. Salvador&rsquo;s College. The rooms for students seemed very commodious, and Dr. Johnson said, the chapel was the neatest place of worship he had seen. The key of the library could not be found; for it seems Professor Hill, who was out of town, had taken it with him. Dr. Johnson told a joke he had heard of a monastery abroad, where the key of the library could never be found.</p>
<p class="p24">It was somewhat dispiriting, to see this ancient archiepiscopal city now sadly deserted. We saw in one of its streets a remarkable proof of liberal toleration; a nonjuring clergyman, strutting about in his canonicals, with a jolly countenance and a round belly, like a well-fed monk.</p>
<p class="p24">We observed two occupations united in the same person, who had hung out two sign-posts. Upon one was, &lsquo;James Hood, White Iron Smith&rsquo; (<span class="t8">i.e.</span> Tin-plate Worker). Upon another, &lsquo;The Art of Fencing taught, by James Hood.&rsquo; &mdash; Upon this last were painted some trees, and two men fencing, one of whom had hit the other in the eye, to shew his great dexterity; so that the art was well taught. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Were I studying here, I should go and take a lesson. I remember <span class="t8">Hope</span>, in his book on this art, says, &ldquo;the Scotch are very good fencers.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">We returned to the inn, where we had been entertained at dinner, and drank tea in company with some of the Professors, of whose civilities I beg leave to add my humble and very grateful acknowledgement to the honourable testimony of Dr. Johnson, in his <span class="t8">Journey</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">We talked of composition, which was a favourite topick of Dr. Watson&rsquo;s, who first distinguished himself by lectures on rhetorick. JOHNSON. &lsquo;I advised Chambers, and would advise every young man beginning to compose, to do it as fast as he can, to get a habit of having his mind to start promptly; it is so much more difficult to improve in speed than in accuracy.&rsquo; WATSON. &lsquo;I own I am for much attention to accuracy in composing, lest one should get bad habits of doing it in a slovenly manner.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, you are confounding <span class="t8">doing</span> inaccurately with the <span class="t8">necessity</span> of doing inaccurately. A man knows when his composition is inaccurate, and when he thinks fit he&rsquo;ll correct it. But, if a man is accustomed to compose slowly, and with difficulty, upon all occasions, there is danger that he may not compose at all, as we do not like to do that which is not done easily; and, at any rate, more time is consumed in a small matter than ought to be.&rsquo; WATSON. &lsquo;Dr. Hugh Blair has taken a week to compose a sermon.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Then, Sir, that is for want of the habit of composing quickly, which I am insisting one should acquire.&rsquo; WATSON. &lsquo;Blair was not composing all the week, but only such hours as he found himself disposed for composition.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Nay, Sir, unless you tell me the time he took, you tell me nothing. If I say I took a week to walk a mile, and have had the gout five days, and been ill otherwise another day, I have taken but one day. I myself have composed about forty sermons. I have begun a sermon after dinner, and sent it off by the post that night. I wrote forty-eight of the printed octavo pages of the <span class="t8">Life of Savage</span> at a sitting; but then I sat up all night. I have also written six sheets in a day of translation from the French.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;We have all observed how one man dresses himself slowly, and another fast.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Yes, Sir: it is wonderful how much time some people will consume in dressing; taking up a thing and looking at it, and laying it down, and taking it up again. Every one should get the habit of doing it quickly. I would say to a young divine, &ldquo;Here is your text; let me see how soon you can make a sermon.&rdquo; Then I&rsquo;d say, &ldquo;Let me see how much better you can make it.&rdquo; Thus I should see both his powers and his judgement.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">We all went to Dr. Watson&rsquo;s to supper. Miss Sharp, great grandchild of Archbishop Sharp, was there; as was Mr. Craig, the ingenious architect of the new town of Edinburgh and nephew of Thomson, to whom Dr. Johnson has since done so much justice, in his <span class="t8">Lives of the Poets</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">We talked of memory, and its various modes. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Memory will play strange tricks. One sometimes loses a single word. I once lost <span class="t8">fugaces</span> in the Ode <span class="t8">Posthume, Posthume</span>.&rsquo; I mentioned to him, that a worthy gentleman of my acquaintance actually forgot his own name. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, that was a morbid oblivion.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">FRIDAY, AUGUST 20.</span></p>
<p class="p21">Dr. Shaw, the professor of divinity, breakfasted with us. I took out my <span class="t8">Ogden on Prayer</span>, and read some of it to the company. Dr. Johnson praised him. &lsquo;Abernethy, (said he,) allows only of a physical effect of prayer upon the mind, which may be produced many ways, as well as by prayer; for instance, by meditation. Ogden goes farther. In truth, we have the consent of all nations for the efficacy of prayer, whether offered up by individuals, or by assemblies; and Revelation has told us, it will be effectual.&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;Leechman seemed to incline to Abernethy&rsquo;s doctrine.&rsquo; Dr. Watson observed, that Leechman meant to shew, that, even admitting no effect to be produced by prayer, respecting the Deity, it was useful to our own minds. He had given only a part of his system. Dr. Johnson thought he should have given the whole.</p>
<p class="p24">Dr. Johnson enforced the strict observance of Sunday. &lsquo;It should be different (he observed) from another day. People may walk, but not throw stones at birds. There may be relaxation, but there should be no levity.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">We went and saw Colonel Nairne&rsquo;s garden and grotto. Here was a fine old plane tree. Unluckily the colonel said, there was but this and another large tree in the county. This assertion was an excellent cue for Dr. Johnson, who laughed enormously, calling to me to hear it. He had expatiated to me on the nakedness of that part of Scotland which he had seen. His <span class="t8">Journey</span> has been violently abused, for what he has said upon this subject. But let it be considered, that, when Dr. Johnson talks of trees, he means trees of good size, such as he was accustomed to see in England; and of these there are certainly very few upon the <span class="t8">eastern coast</span> of Scotland. Besides, he said, that he meant to give only a map of the road; and let any traveller observe how many trees, which deserve the name, he can see from the road from Berwick to Aberdeen. Had Dr. Johnson said, &lsquo;there are <span class="t8">no</span> trees&rsquo; upon this line, he would have said what is colloquially true; because, by no trees, in common speech, we mean few. When he is particular in counting, he may be attacked. I know not how Colonel Nairne came to say there were but <span class="t8">two</span> large trees in the county of Fife. I did not perceive that he smiled. There are certainly not a great many; but I could have shewn him more than two at <span class="t8">Balmuto</span>, from whence my ancestors came, and which now belongs to a branch of my family.</p>
<p class="p24">The grotto was ingeniously constructed. In the front of it were petrified stocks of fir, plane, and some other tree. Dr. Johnson said, &lsquo;Scotland has no right to boast of this grotto; it is owing to personal merit. I never denied personal merit to many of you.&rsquo; Professor Shaw said to me, as we walked, &lsquo;This is a wonderful man; he is master of every subject he handles.&rsquo; Dr. Watson allowed him a very strong understanding, but wondered at his total inattention to established manners, as he came from London.</p>
<p class="p24">I have not preserved in my Journal, any of the conversation which passed between Dr. Johnson and Professor Shaw; but I recollect Dr. Johnson said to me afterwards, &lsquo;I took much to Shaw.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">We left St. Andrews about noon, and some miles from it observing, at <span class="t8">Leuchars</span>, a church with an old tower, we stopped to look at it. The <span class="t8">manse</span>, as the parsonage-house is called in Scotland, was close by. I waited on the minister, mentioned our names, and begged he would tell us what he knew about it. He was a very civil old man; but could only inform us, that it was supposed to have stood eight hundred years. He told us, there was a colony of Danes in his parish; that they had landed at a remote period of time, and still remained a distinct people. Dr. Johnson shrewdly inquired whether they had brought women with them. We were not satisfied as to this colony.</p>
<p class="p24">We saw, this day, Dundee and Aberbrothick, the last of which Dr. Johnson has celebrated in his <span class="t8">Journey</span>. Upon the road we talked of the Roman Catholick faith. He mentioned (I think) Tillotson&rsquo;s argument against transubstantiation: &lsquo;That we are as sure we see bread and wine only, as that we read in the Bible the text on which that false doctrine is founded. We have only the evidence of our senses for both.&rsquo; &lsquo;If, (he added,) GOD had never spoken figuratively, we might hold that he speaks literally, when he says, &ldquo;This is my body.&rdquo;&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;But what do you say, Sir, to the ancient and continued tradition of the church upon this point?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Tradition, Sir, has no place, where the Scriptures are plain; and tradition cannot persuade a man into a belief of transubstantiation. Able men, indeed, have <span class="t8">said</span> they believed it.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">This is an awful subject. I did not then press Dr. Johnson upon it: nor shall I now enter upon a disquisition concerning the import of those words uttered by our Saviour, which had such an effect upon many of his disciples, that they &lsquo;went back, and walked no more with him.&rsquo; The Catechism and solemn office for Communion, in the Church of England, maintain a mysterious belief in more than a mere commemoration of the death of Christ, by partaking of the elements of bread and wine.</p>
<p class="p24">Dr. Johnson put me in mind, that, at St. Andrews, I had defended my profession very well, when the question had again been started, Whether a lawyer might honestly engage with the first side that offers him a fee. &lsquo;Sir, (said I,) it was with your arguments against Sir William Forbes: but it was much that I could wield the arms of Goliah.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He said, our judges had not gone deep in the question concerning literary property. I mentioned Lord Monboddo&rsquo;s opinion, that if a man could get a work by heart, he might print it, as by such an act the mind is exercised. JOHNSON. &lsquo;No, Sir; a man&rsquo;s repeating it no more makes it his property, than a man may sell a cow which he drives home.&rsquo; I said, printing an abridgement of a work was allowed, which was only cutting the horns and tail off the cow. JOHNSON. &lsquo;No, Sir; &rsquo;tis making the cow have a calf.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">About eleven at night we arrived at Montrose. We found but a sorry inn, where I myself saw another waiter put a lump of sugar with his fingers into Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s lemonade, for which he called him &lsquo;Rascal!&rsquo; It put me in great glee that our landlord was an Englishman. I rallied the Doctor upon this, and he grew quiet. Both Sir John Hawkins&rsquo;s and Dr. Burney&rsquo;s <span class="t8">History of Musick</span> had then been advertised. I asked if this was not unlucky: would not they hurt one another? JOHNSON. &lsquo;No, Sir. They will do good to one another. Some will buy the one, some the other, and compare them; and so a talk is made about a thing, and the books are sold.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He was angry at me for proposing to carry lemons with us to Sky, that he might be sure to have his lemonade. &lsquo;Sir, (said he,) I do not wish to be thought that feeble man who cannot do without any thing. Sir, it is very bad manners to carry provisions to any man&rsquo;s house, as if he could not entertain you. To an inferior, it is oppressive; to a superior, it is insolent.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Having taken the liberty, this evening, to remark to Dr. Johnson, that he very often sat quite silent for a long time, even when in company with only a single friend, which I myself had sometimes sadly experienced, he smiled and said, &lsquo;It is true, Sir. Tom Tyers, (for so he familiarly called our ingenious friend, who, since his death, has paid a biographical tribute to his memory,) Tom Tyers described me the best. He once said to me, &ldquo;Sir, you are like a ghost: you never speak till you are spoken to.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">SATURDAY, AUGUST 31.</span></p>
<p class="p21">Neither the Rev. Mr. Nisbet, the established minister, nor the Rev. Mr. Spooner, the episcopal minister, were in town. Before breakfast, we went and saw the town-hall, where is a good dancing-room, and other rooms for tea-drinking. The appearance of the town from it is very well; but many of the houses are built with their ends to the street, which looks awkward. When we came down from it, I met Mr. Gleg, a merchant here. He went with us to see the English chapel. It is situated on a pretty dry spot, and there is a fine walk to it. It is really an elegant building, both within and without. The organ is adorned with green and gold. Dr. Johnson gave a shilling extraordinary to the clerk, saying, &lsquo;He belongs to an honest church.&rsquo; I put him in mind, that episcopals were but <span class="t8">dissenters</span> here; they were only <span class="t8">tolerated</span>. &lsquo;Sir, (said he,) we are here, as Christians in Turkey.&rsquo; He afterwards went into an apothecary&rsquo;s shop, and ordered some medicine for himself, and wrote the prescription in technical characters. The boy took him for a physician.</p>
<p class="p24">I doubted much which road to take, whether to go by the coast, or by Laurence Kirk and Monboddo. I knew Lord Monboddo and Dr. Johnson did not love each other; yet I was unwilling not to visit his Lordship; and was also curious to see them together. I mentioned my doubts to Dr. Johnson, who said, he would go two miles out of his way to see Lord Monboddo. I therefore sent Joseph forward with the following note: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Montrose, August 21.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;My Dear Lord,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Thus far I am come with Mr. Samuel Johnson. We must be at Aberdeen to-night. I know you do not admire him so much as I do; but I cannot be in this country without making you a bow at your old place, as I do not know if I may again have an opportunity of seeing Monboddo. Besides, Mr. Johnson says, he would go two miles out of his way to see Lord Monboddo. I have sent forward my servant, that we may know if your lordship be at home.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am ever, my dear lord,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Most sincerely yours,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;JAMES BOSWELL.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">As we travelled onwards from Montrose, we had the Grampion hills in our view, and some good land around us, but void of trees and hedges. Dr. Johnson has said ludicrously, in his <span class="t8">Journey</span>, that the <span class="t8">hedges</span> were of <span class="t8">stone</span>; for, instead of the verdant <span class="t8">thorn</span> to refresh the eye, we found the bare <span class="t8">wall</span> or <span class="t8">dike</span> intersecting the prospect. He observed, that it was wonderful to see a country so divested, so denuded of trees.</p>
<p class="p24">We stopped at Laurence Kirk, where our great Grammarian, Ruddiman, was once schoolmaster. We respectfully remembered that excellent man and eminent scholar, by whose labours a knowledge of the Latin language will be preserved in Scotland, if it shall be preserved at all. Lord Gardenston, one of our judges, collected money to raise a monument to him at this place, which I hope will be well executed. I know my father gave five guineas towards it. Lord Gardenston is the proprietor of Laurence Kirk, and has encouraged the building of a manufacturing village, of which he is exceedingly fond, and has written a pamphlet upon it, as if he had founded Thebes; in which, however, there are many useful precepts strongly expressed. The village seemed to be irregularly built, some of the houses being of clay, some of brick, and some of brick and stone. Dr. Johnson observed, they thatched well here. I was a little acquainted with Mr. Forbes, the minister of the parish. I sent to inform him that a gentleman desired to see him. He returned for answer, &lsquo;that he would not come to a stranger.&rsquo; I then gave my name, and he came. I remonstrated to him for not coming to a stranger; and, by presenting him to Dr. Johnson, proved to him what a stranger might sometimes be. His Bible inculcates, &lsquo;be not forgetful to entertain strangers,&rsquo; and mentions the same motive. He defended himself by saying, &lsquo;He had once come to a stranger who sent for him; and he found him &ldquo;<span class="t8">a little worth person!</span>&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Dr. Johnson insisted on stopping at the inn, as I told him that Lord Gardenston had furnished it with a collection of books, that travellers might have entertainment for the mind, as well as the body. He praised the design, but wished there had been more books, and those better chosen.</p>
<p class="p24">About a mile from Monboddo, where you turn off the road, Joseph was waiting to tell us my lord expected us to dinner. We drove over a wild moor. It rained, and the scene was somewhat dreary. Dr. Johnson repeated, with solemn emphasis, Macbeth&rsquo;s speech on meeting the witches. As we travelled on, he told me, &lsquo;Sir, you got into our club by doing what a man can do. Several of the members wished to keep you out. Burke told me, he doubted if you were fit for it: but, now you are in, none of them are sorry. Burke says, that you have so much good humour naturally, it is scarce a virtue.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;They were afraid of you, Sir, as it was you who proposed me.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, they knew, that if they refused you, they&rsquo;d probably never have got in another. I&rsquo;d have kept them all out. Beauclerk was very earnest for you.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &ldquo;Beauclerk has a keenness of mind which is very uncommon.&rdquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Yes, Sir; and everything comes from him so easily. It appears to me that I labour, when I say a good thing.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;You are loud, Sir; but it is not an effort of mind.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Monboddo is a wretched place, wild and naked, with a poor old house; though, if I recollect right, there are two turrets which mark an old baron&rsquo;s residence. Lord Monboddo received us at his gate most courteously; pointed to the Douglas arms upon his house, and told us that his great-grandmother was of that family. &lsquo;In such houses (said he,) our ancestors lived, who were better men than we.&rsquo; &lsquo;No, no, my lord (said Dr. Johnson). We are as strong as they, and a great deal wiser.&rsquo; This was an assault upon one of Lord Monboddo&rsquo;s capital dogmas, and I was afraid there would have been a violent altercation in the very close, before we got into the house. But his lordship is distinguished not only for &lsquo;ancient metaphysicks,&rsquo; but for ancient <span class="t8">politesse</span>, &lsquo;<span class="t8">la vieille cour</span>&rsquo; and he made no reply.</p>
<p class="p24">His lordship was dressed in a rustick suit, and wore a little round hat; he told us, we now saw him as <span class="t8">Farmer Burnet</span>, and we should have his family dinner, a farmer&rsquo;s dinner. He said, &lsquo;I should not have forgiven Mr. Boswell, had he not brought you here, Dr. Johnson.&rsquo; He produced a very long stalk of corn, as a specimen of his crop, and said, &lsquo;You see here the <span class="t8">loetas segetes</span>;&rsquo; he added, that <span class="t8">Virgil</span> seemed to be as enthusiastick a farmer as he, and was certainly a practical one. JOHNSON. &lsquo;It does not always follow, my lord, that a man who has written a good poem on an art, has practised it. Philip Miller told me, that in Philips&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Cyder</span>, a poem, all the precepts were just, and indeed better than in books written for the purpose of instructing; yet Philips had never made cyder.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I started the subject of emigration. JOHNSON. &lsquo;To a man of mere animal life, you can urge no argument against going to America, but that it will be some time before he will get the earth to produce. But a man of any intellectual enjoyment will not easily go and immerse himself and his posterity for ages in barbarism.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He and my lord spoke highly of Homer. JOHNSON. &lsquo;He had all the learning of his age. The shield of Achilles shews a nation in war, a nation in peace; harvest sport, nay, stealing.&rsquo; MONBODDO. &lsquo;Ay, and what we (looking to me) would call a parliament-house scene; a cause pleaded.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;That is part of the life of a nation in peace. And there are in Homer such characters of heroes, and combinations of qualities of heroes, that the united powers of mankind ever since have not produced any but what are to be found there.&rsquo; MONBODDO. &lsquo;Yet no character is described.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;No; they all develope themselves. Agamemnon is always a gentleman-like character; he has always [Greek: Basilikon ti]. That the ancients held so, is plain from this; that Euripides, in his <span class="t8">Hecuba</span>, makes him the person to interpose.&rsquo; MONBODDO. &lsquo;The history of manners is the most valuable. I never set a high value on any other history.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Nor I; and therefore I esteem biography, as giving us what comes near to ourselves, what we can turn to use.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;But in the course of general history, we find manners. In wars, we see the dispositions of people, their degrees of humanity, and other particulars.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Yes; but then you must take all the facts to get this; and it is but a little you get.&rsquo; MONBODDO. &lsquo;And it is that little which makes history valuable.&rsquo; Bravo! thought I; they agree like two brothers. MONBODDO. &lsquo;I am sorry, Dr. Johnson, you were not longer at Edinburgh to receive the homage of our men of learning.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;My lord, I received great respect and great kindness.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;He goes back to Edinburgh after our tour.&rsquo; We talked of the decrease of learning in Scotland, and of the <span class="t8">Muses&rsquo; Welcome</span>. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Learning is much decreased in England, in my remembrance.&rsquo; MONBODDO. &lsquo;You, Sir, have lived to see its decrease in England, I its extinction in Scotland.&rsquo; However, I brought him to confess that the High School of Edinburgh did well. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Learning has decreased in England, because learning will not do so much for a man as formerly. There are other ways of getting preferment. Few bishops are now made for their learning. To be a bishop, a man must be learned in a learned age, &mdash; factious in a factious age; but always of eminence. Warburton is an exception; though his learning alone did not raise him. He was first an antagonist to Pope, and helped Theobald to publish his <span class="t8">Shakspeare</span>; but, seeing Pope the rising man, when Crousaz attacked his <span class="t8">Essay on Man</span>, for some faults which it has, and some which it has not, Warburton defended it in the Review of that time. This brought him acquainted with Pope, and he gained his friendship. Pope introduced him to Allen, Allen married him to his niece: so, by Allen&rsquo;s interest and his own, he was made a bishop. But then his learning was the <span class="t8">sine qua non</span>: he knew how to make the most of it; but I do not find by any dishonest means.&rsquo; MONBODDO. &lsquo;He is a great man.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Yes; he has great knowledge, &mdash; great power of mind. Hardly any man brings greater variety of learning to bear upon his point.&rsquo; MONBODDO. &lsquo;He is one of the greatest lights of your church.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, we are not so sure of his being very friendly to us. He blazes, if you will, but that is not always the steadiest light. Lowth is another bishop who has risen by his learning.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Dr. Johnson examined young Arthur, Lord Monboddo&rsquo;s son, in Latin. He answered very well; upon which he said, with complacency, &lsquo;Get you gone! When King James comes back, you shall be in the <span class="t8">Muses Welcome</span>!&rsquo; My lord and Dr. Johnson disputed a little, whether the Savage or the London Shopkeeper had the best existence; his lordship, as usual, preferring the Savage. My lord was extremely hospitable, and I saw both Dr. Johnson and him liking each other better every hour.</p>
<p class="p24">Dr. Johnson having retired for a short time, his lordship spoke of his conversation as I could have wished. Dr. Johnson had said, &lsquo;I have done greater feats with my knife than this;&rsquo; though he had eaten a very hearty dinner. My lord, who affects or believes he follows an abstemious system, seemed struck with Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s manner of living. I had a particular satisfaction in being under the roof of Monboddo, my lord being my father&rsquo;s old friend, and having been always very good to me. We were cordial together. He asked Dr. Johnson and me to stay all night. When I said we <span class="t8">must</span> be at Aberdeen, he replied, &lsquo;Well, I am like the Romans: I shall say to you, &ldquo;Happy to come; &mdash; happy to depart!&rdquo;&rsquo; He thanked Dr. Johnson for his visit.</p>
<p class="p24">JOHNSON. &lsquo;I little thought, when I had the honour to meet your Lordship in London, that I should see you at Monboddo.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">After dinner, as the ladies were going away, Dr. Johnson would stand up. He insisted that politeness was of great consequence in society. &lsquo;It is, (said he,) fictitious benevolence. It supplies the place of it amongst those who see each other only in publick, or but little. Depend upon it, the want of it never fails to produce something disagreeable to one or other. I have always applied to good breeding, what Addison in his <span class="t8">Cato</span> says of honour: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Honour&rsquo;s a sacred tie; the law of Kings;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The noble mind&rsquo;s distinguishing perfection,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That aids and strengthens Virtue where it meets her;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And imitates her actions where she is not.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">When he took up his large oak stick, he said, &lsquo;My lord, that&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Homerick</span>;&rsquo; thus pleasantly alluding to his lordship&rsquo;s favourite writer.</p>
<p class="p24">Gory, my lord&rsquo;s black servant, was sent as our guide, to conduct us to the high road. The circumstance of each of them having a black servant was another point of similarity between Johnson and Monboddo. I observed how curious it was to see an African in the North of Scotland, with little or no difference of manners from those of the natives. Dr. Johnson laughed to see Gory and Joseph riding together most cordially. &lsquo;Those two fellows, (said he,) one from Africa, the other from Bohemia, seem quite at home.&rsquo; He was much pleased with Lord Monboddo to-day. He said, he would have pardoned him for a few paradoxes, when he found he had so much that was good: but that, from his appearance in London, he thought him all paradox; which would not do. He observed that his lordship had talked no paradoxes to-day. &lsquo;And as to the savage and the London shopkeeper, (said he,) I don&rsquo;t know but I might have taken the side of the savage equally, had any body else taken the side of the shopkeeper.&rsquo; He had said to my lord, in opposition to the value of the savage&rsquo;s courage, that it was owing to his limited power of thinking, and repeated Pope&rsquo;s verses, in which &lsquo;Macedonia&rsquo;s madman&rsquo; is introduced, and the conclusion is, </p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Yet ne&rsquo;er looks forward farther than his nose.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I objected to the last phrase, as being low. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, it is intended to be low: it is satire. The expression is debased, to debase the character.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">When Gory was about to part from us, Dr. Johnson called to him, &lsquo;Mr. Gory, give me leave to ask you a question! are you baptised?&rsquo; Gory told him he was, and confirmed by the Bishop of Durham. He then gave him a shilling.</p>
<p class="p24">We had tedious driving this afternoon, and were somewhat drowsy. Last night I was afraid Dr. Johnson was beginning to faint in his resolution; for he said, &lsquo;If we must ride much, we shall not go; and there&rsquo;s an end on&rsquo;t.&rsquo; To-day, when he talked of <span class="t8">Sky</span> with spirit, I said, &lsquo;Why, Sir, you seemed to me to despond yesterday. You are a delicate Londoner; &mdash; you are a maccaroni; you can&rsquo;t ride.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, I shall ride better than you. I was only afraid I should not find a horse able to carry me.&rsquo; I hoped then there would be no fear of getting through our wild Tour.</p>
<p class="p24">We came to Aberdeen at half an hour past eleven. The New Inn, we were told, was full. This was comfortless. The waiter, however, asked, if one of our names was Boswell, and brought me a letter left at the inn: it was from Mr. Thrale, enclosing one to Dr. Johnson. Finding who I was, we were told they would contrive to lodge us by putting us for a night into a room with two beds. The waiter said to me in the broad strong Aberdeenshire dialect, &lsquo;I thought I knew you by your likeness to your father.&rsquo; My father puts up at the New Inn, when on his circuit. Little was said to-night. I was to sleep in a little press-bed in Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s room. I had it wheeled out into the dining-room, and there I lay very well.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">SUNDAY, AUGUST 22.</span></p>
<p class="p21">I sent a message to Professor Thomas Gordon, who came and breakfasted with us. He had secured seats for us at the English chapel. We found a respectable congregation, and an admirable organ, well played by Mr. Tait.</p>
<p class="p24">We walked down to the shore: Dr. Johnson laughed to hear that Cromwell&rsquo;s soldiers taught the Aberdeen people to make shoes and stockings, and to plant cabbages. He asked, if weaving the plaids was ever a domestick art in the Highlands, like spinning or knitting. They could not inform him here. But he conjectured probably, that where people lived so remote from each other, it was likely to be a domestick art; as we see it was among the ancients, from Penelope. I was sensible to-day, to an extraordinary degree, of Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s excellent English pronunciation. I cannot account for its striking me more now than any other day: but it was as if new to me; and I listened to every sentence which he spoke, as to a musical composition. Professor Gordon gave him an account of the plan of education in his college. Dr. Johnson said, it was similar to that at Oxford. Waller the poet&rsquo;s great-grandson was studying here. Dr. Johnson wondered that a man should send his son so far off, when there were so many good schools in England. He said, &lsquo;At a great school there is all the splendour and illumination of many minds; the radiance of all is concentrated in each, or at least reflected upon each. But we must own that neither a dull boy, nor an idle boy, will do so well at a great school as at a private one. For at a great school there are always boys enough to do well easily, who are sufficient to keep up the credit of the school; and after whipping being tried to no purpose, the dull or idle boys are left at the end of a class, having the appearance of going through the course, but learning nothing at all. Such boys may do good at a private school, where constant attention is paid to them, and they are watched. So that the question of publick or private education is not properly a general one; but whether one or the other is best for <span class="t8">my son</span>.&rsquo; We were told the present Mr. Waller was a plain country gentleman; and his son would be such another. I observed, a family could not expect a poet but in a hundred generations. &lsquo;Nay, (said Dr. Johnson,) not one family in a hundred can expect a poet in a hundred generations.&rsquo; He then repeated Dryden&rsquo;s celebrated lines, </p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Three poets in three distant ages born,&rsquo; &amp;c.</p>
<p class="p24">and a part of a Latin translation of it done at Oxford: he did not then say by whom.</p>
<p class="p24">He received a card from Sir Alexander Gordon, who had been his acquaintance twenty years ago in London, and who, &lsquo;if forgiven for not answering a line from him,&rsquo; would come in the afternoon. Dr. Johnson rejoiced to hear of him, and begged he would come and dine with us. I was much pleased to see the kindness with which Dr. Johnson received his old friend Sir Alexander; a gentleman of good family, <span class="t8">Lismore</span>, but who had not the estate. The King&rsquo;s College here made him Professor of Medicine, which affords him a decent subsistence. He told us that the value of the stockings exported from Aberdeen was, in peace, a hundred thousand pounds; and amounted, in time of war, to one hundred and seventy thousand pounds. Dr. Johnson asked, What made the difference? Here we had a proof of the comparative sagacity of the two professors. Sir Alexander answered, &lsquo;Because there is more occasion for them in war.&rsquo; Professor Thomas Gordon answered, &lsquo;Because the Germans, who are our great rivals in the manufacture of stockings, are otherwise employed in time of war.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, you have given a very good solution.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">At dinner, Dr. Johnson ate several plate-fulls of Scotch broth, with barley and peas in it, and seemed very fond of the dish. I said, &lsquo;You never ate it before.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;No, Sir; but I don&rsquo;t care how soon I eat it again.&rsquo; My cousin, Miss Dallas, formerly of Inverness, was married to Mr. Riddoch, one of the ministers of the English chapel here. He was ill, and confined to his room; but she sent us a kind invitation to tea, which we all accepted. She was the same lively, sensible, cheerful woman as ever. Dr. Johnson here threw out some jokes against Scotland. He said, &lsquo;You go first to Aberdeen; then to <span class="t8">Enbru</span> (the Scottish pronunciation of Edinburgh); then to Newcastle, to be polished by the colliers; then to York; then to London.&rsquo; And he laid hold of a little girl, Stuart Dallas, niece to Mrs. Riddoch, and, representing himself as a giant, said, he would take her with him! telling her, in a hollow voice, that he lived in a cave, and had a bed in the rock, and she should have a little bed cut opposite to it!</p>
<p class="p24">He thus treated the point, as to prescription of murder in Scotland. &lsquo;A jury in England would make allowance for deficiencies of evidence, on account of lapse of time; but a general rule that a crime should not be punished, or tried for the purpose of punishment, after twenty years, is bad. It is cant to talk of the King&rsquo;s advocate delaying a prosecution from malice. How unlikely is it the King&rsquo;s advocate should have malice against persons who commit murder, or should even know them at all. If the son of the murdered man should kill the murderer who got off merely by prescription, I would help him to make his escape; though, were I upon his jury, I would not acquit him. I would not advise him to commit such an act. On the contrary, I would bid him submit to the determination of society, because a man is bound to submit to the inconveniences of it, as he enjoys the good: but the young man, though politically wrong, would not be morally wrong. He would have to say, &lsquo;here I am amongst barbarians, who not only refuse to do justice, but encourage the greatest of all crimes. I am therefore in a state of nature: for, so far as there is no law, it is a state of nature: and consequently, upon the eternal and immutable law of justice, which requires that he who sheds man&rsquo;s blood should have his blood shed, I will stab the murderer of my father.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">We went to our inn, and sat quietly. Dr. Johnson borrowed, at Mr. Riddoch&rsquo;s, a volume of <span class="t8">Massillon&rsquo;s Discourses on the Psalms</span>: but I found he read little in it. Ogden too he sometimes took up, and glanced at; but threw it down again. I then entered upon religious conversation. Never did I see him in a better frame: calm, gentle, wise, holy. I said, &lsquo;Would not the same objection hold against the Trinity as against Transubstantiation?&rsquo; &lsquo;Yes, (said he,) if you take three and one in the same sense. If you do so, to be sure you cannot believe it: but the three persons in the Godhead are Three in one sense, and One in another. We cannot tell how; and that is the mystery!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I spoke of the satisfaction of Christ. He said his notion was, that it did not atone for the sins of the world; but, by satisfying divine justice, by shewing that no less than the Son of God suffered for sin, it shewed to men and innumerable created beings, the heinousness of it, and therefore rendered it unnecessary for divine vengeance to be exercised against sinners, as it otherwise must have been; that in this way it might operate even in favour of those who had never heard of it: as to those who did hear of it, the effect it should produce would be repentance and piety, by impressing upon the mind a just notion of sin: that original sin was the propensity to evil, which no doubt was occasioned by the fall. He presented this solemn subject in a new light to me, and rendered much more rational and clear the doctrine of what our Saviour has done for us; &mdash; as it removed the notion of imputed righteousness in co-operating; whereas by this view, Christ has done all already that he had to do, or is ever to do for mankind, by making his great satisfaction; the consequences of which will affect each individual according to the particular conduct of each. I would illustrate this by saying, that Christ&rsquo;s satisfaction resembles a sun placed to shew light to men, so that it depends upon themselves whether they will walk the right way or not, which they could not have done without that sun, &lsquo;<span class="t8">the sun of righteousness</span>&rsquo; There is, however, more in it than merely giving light &mdash; <span class="t8">a light to lighten the Gentiles</span>: for we are told, there <span class="t8">is healing under his wings</span>. Dr. Johnson said to me, &lsquo;Richard Baxter commends a treatise by Grotius, <span class="t8">De Satisfactione Christi</span>. I have never read it: but I intend to read it; and you may read it.&rsquo; I remarked, upon the principle now laid down, we might explain the difficult and seemingly hard text, &lsquo;They that believe shall be saved; and they that believe not shall be damned:&rsquo; They that believe shall have such an impression made upon their minds, as will make them act so that they may be accepted by GOD.</p>
<p class="p24">We talked of one of our friends taking ill, for a length of time, a hasty expression of Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s to him, on his attempting to prosecute a subject that had a reference to religion, beyond the bounds within which the Doctor thought such topicks should be confined in a mixed company. JOHNSON. &lsquo;What is to become of society, if a friendship of twenty years is to be broken off for such a cause?&rsquo; As Bacon says, </p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Who then to frail mortality shall trust,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But limns the water, or but writes in dust.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I said, he should write expressly in support of Christianity; for that, although a reverence for it shines through his works in several places, that is not enough. &lsquo;You know, (said I,) what Grotius has done, and what Addison has done. &mdash; You should do also.&rsquo; He replied, &lsquo;I hope I shall.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">MONDAY, AUGUST 23.</span></p>
<p class="p21">Principal Campbell, Sir Alexander Gordon, Professor Gordon, and Professor Ross, visited us in the morning, as did Dr. Gerard, who had come six miles from the country on purpose. We went and saw the Marischal College, and at one o&rsquo;clock we waited on the magistrates in the town hall, as they had invited us in order to present Dr. Johnson with the freedom of the town, which Provost Jopp did with a very good grace. Dr. Johnson was much pleased with this mark of attention, and received it very politely. There was a pretty numerous company assembled. It was striking to hear all of them drinking &lsquo;Dr. Johnson! Dr. Johnson!&rsquo; in the town-hall of Aberdeen, and then to see him with his burgess-ticket, or diploma, in his hat, which he wore as he walked along the street, according to the usual custom. It gave me great satisfaction to observe the regard, and indeed fondness too, which every body here had for my father.</p>
<p class="p24">While Sir Alexander Gordon conducted Dr. Johnson to old Aberdeen, Professor Gordon and I called on Mr. Riddoch, whom I found to be a grave worthy clergyman. He observed, that, whatever might be said of Dr. Johnson while he was alive, he would, after he was dead, be looked upon by the world with regard and astonishment, on account of his <span class="t8">Dictionary</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">Professor Gordon and I walked over to the Old College, which Dr. Johnson had seen by this time. I stepped into the chapel, and looked at the tomb of the founder, Archbishop Elphinston, of whom I shall have occasion to write in my <span class="t8">History of James IV. of Scotland</span>, the patron of my family. We dined at Sir Alexander Gordon&rsquo;s. The Provost, Professor Ross, Professor Dunbar, Professor Thomas Gordon, were there. After dinner came in Dr. Gerard, Professor Leslie, Professor Macleod. We had little or no conversation in the morning; now we were but barren. The professors seemed afraid to speak.</p>
<p class="p24">Dr. Gerard told us that an eminent printer was very intimate with Warburton. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, he has printed some of his works, and perhaps bought the property of some of them. The intimacy is such as one of the professors here may have with one of the carpenters who is repairing the college.&rsquo; &lsquo;But, (said Gerard,) I saw a letter from him to this printer, in which he says, that the one half of the clergy of the church of Scotland are fanaticks, and the other half infidels.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Warburton has accustomed himself to write letters just as he speaks, without thinking any more of what he throws out. When I read Warburton first, and observed his force, and his contempt of mankind, I thought he had driven the world before him; but I soon found that was not the case; for Warburton, by extending his abuse, rendered it ineffectual.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He told me, when we were by ourselves, that he thought it very wrong in the printer to shew Warburton&rsquo;s letter, as it was raising a body of enemies against him. He thought it foolish in Warburton to write so to the printer; and added, &lsquo;Sir, the worst way of being intimate, is by scribbling.&rsquo; He called Warburton&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Doctrine of Grace</span> a poor performance, and so he said was Wesley&rsquo;s Answer. &lsquo;Warburton, he observed, had laid himself very open. In particular, he was weak enough to say, that, in some disorders of the imagination, people had spoken with tongues, had spoken languages which they never knew before; a thing as absurd as to say, that, in some disorders of the imagination, people had been known to fly.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I talked of the difference of genius, to try if I could engage Gerard in a disquisition with Dr. Johnson; but I did not succeed. I mentioned, as a curious fact, that Locke had written verses. JOHNSON. &lsquo;I know of none, Sir, but a kind of exercise prefixed to Dr. Sydenham&rsquo;s Works, in which he has some conceits about the dropsy, in which water and burning are united; and how Dr. Sydenham removed fire by drawing off water, contrary to the usual practice, which is to extinguish fire by bringing water upon it. I am not sure that there is a word of all this; but it is such kind of talk.&rsquo; We spoke of <span class="t8">Fingal</span>. Dr. Johnson said calmly, &lsquo;If the poems were really translated, they were certainly first written down. Let Mr. Macpherson deposite the manuscript in one of the colleges at Aberdeen, where there are people who can judge; and, if the professors certify the authenticity, then there will be an end of the controversy. If he does not take this obvious and easy method, he gives the best reason to doubt; considering too, how much is against it <span class="t8">à priori&rsquo;</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">We sauntered after dinner in Sir Alexander&rsquo;s garden, and saw his little grotto, which is hung with pieces of poetry written in a fair hand. It was agreeable to observe the contentment and kindness of this quiet, benevolent man. Professor Macleod was brother to Macleod of Talisker, and brother-in-law to the Laird of Col. He gave me a letter to young Col. I was weary of this day, and began to think wishfully of being again in motion. I was uneasy to think myself too fastidious, whilst I fancied Dr. Johnson quite satisfied. But he owned to me that he was fatigued and teased by Sir Alexander&rsquo;s doing too much to entertain him. I said, it was all kindness. JOHNSON. &lsquo;True, Sir; but sensation is sensation.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;It is so: we feel pain equally from the surgeon&rsquo;s probe, as from the sword of the foe.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">We visited two booksellers&rsquo; shops, and could not find Arthur Johnston&rsquo;s Poems&rsquo;. We went and sat near an hour at Mr. Riddoch&rsquo;s. He could not tell distinctly how much education at the college here costs, which disgusted Dr. Johnson. I had pledged myself that we should go to the inn, and not stay supper. They pressed us, but he was resolute. I saw Mr. Riddoch did not please him. He said to me, afterwards, &lsquo;Sir, he has no vigour in his talk.&rsquo; But my friend should have considered that he himself was not in good humour; so that it was not easy to talk to his satisfaction. We sat contentedly at our inn. He then became merry, and observed how little we had either heard or said at Aberdeen: that the Aberdonians had not started a single <span class="t8">mawkin</span> (the Scottish word for hare) for us to pursue.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">TUESDAY, AUGUST 24.</span></p>
<p class="p21">We set out about eight in the morning, and breakfasted at Ellon. The landlady said to me, &lsquo;Is not this the great Doctor that is going about through the country?&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo; &lsquo;Ay, (said she) we heard of him. I made an errand into the room on purpose to see him. There&rsquo;s something great in his appearance: it is a pleasure to have such a man in one&rsquo;s house; a man who does so much good. If I had thought of it, I would have shewn him a child of mine, who has had a lump on his throat for some time.&rsquo; &lsquo;But, (said I,) he is not a doctor of physick.&rsquo; &lsquo;Is he an oculist?&rsquo; said the landlord. &lsquo;No, (said I,) he is only a very learned man.&rsquo; LANDLORD. &lsquo;They say he is the greatest man in England, except Lord Mansfield.&rsquo; Dr. Johnson was highly entertained with this, and I do think he was pleased too. He said, &lsquo;I like the exception: to have called me the greatest man in England, would have been an unmeaning compliment: but the exception marked that the praise was in earnest: and, in <span class="t8">Scotland</span>, the exception must be <span class="t8">Lord Mansfield</span>, or &mdash; <span class="t8">Sir John Pringle</span>.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He told me a good story of Dr. Goldsmith. Graham, who wrote <span class="t8">Telemachus, a Masque</span>, was sitting one night with him and Dr. Johnson, and was half drunk. He rattled away to Dr. Johnson: &lsquo;You are a clever fellow, to be sure; but you cannot write an essay like Addison, or verses like the RAPE OF THE LOCK.&rsquo; At last he said, &lsquo;<span class="t8">Doctor</span>, I should be happy to see you at Eaton.&rsquo; &lsquo;I shall be glad to wait on you,&rsquo; answered Goldsmith. &lsquo;No, (said Graham,) &rsquo;tis not you I mean, Dr. <span class="t8">Minor</span>; &rsquo;tis Doctor <span class="t8">Major</span>, there.&rsquo; Goldsmith was excessively hurt by this. He afterwards spoke of it himself. &lsquo;Graham, (said he,) is a fellow to make one commit suicide.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">We had received a polite invitation to Slains castle. We arrived there just at three o&rsquo;clock, as the bell for dinner was ringing. Though, from its being just on the North-east Ocean, no trees will grow here, Lord Errol has done all that can be done. He has cultivated his fields so as to bear rich crops of every kind, and he has made an excellent kitchen-garden, with a hot-house. I had never seen any of the family: but there had been a card of invitation written by the honourable Charles Boyd, the earl&rsquo;s brother. We were conducted into the house, and at the dining-room door were met by that gentleman, whom both of us at first took to be Lord Errol; but he soon corrected our mistake. My Lord was gone to dine in the neighbourhood, at an entertainment given by Mr. Irvine of Drum. Lady Errol received us politely, and was very attentive to us during the time of dinner. There was nobody at table but her ladyship, Mr. Boyd, and some of the children, their governour and governess. Mr. Boyd put Dr. Johnson in mind of having dined with him at Cumming the Quaker&rsquo;s, along with a Mr. Hall and Miss Williams: this was a bond of connection between them. For me, Mr. Boyd&rsquo;s acquaintance with my father was enough. After dinner, Lady Errol favoured us with a sight of her young family, whom she made stand up in a row. There were six daughters and two sons. It was a very pleasing sight.</p>
<p class="p24">Dr. Johnson proposed our setting out. Mr. Boyd said, he hoped we would stay all night; his brother would be at home in the evening, and would be very sorry if he missed us. Mr. Boyd was called out of the room. I was very desirous to stay in so comfortable a house, and I wished to see Lord Errol. Dr Johnson, however, was right in resolving to go, if we were not asked again, as it is best to err on the safe side in such cases, and to be sure that one is quite welcome. To my great joy, when Mr. Boyd returned, he told Dr. Johnson that it was Lady Errol who had called him out, and said that she would never let Dr. Johnson into the house again, if he went away that night; and that she had ordered the coach, to carry us to view a great curiosity on the coast, after which we should see the house. We cheerfully agreed.</p>
<p class="p24">Mr. Boyd was engaged, in 1745-6, on the same side with many unfortunate mistaken noblemen and gentlemen. He escaped, and lay concealed for a year in the island of Arran, the ancient territory of the Boyds. He then went to France, and was about twenty years on the continent. He married a French Lady, and now lived very comfortably at Aberdeen, and was much at Slains castle. He entertained us with great civility. He had a pompousness or formal plenitude in his conversation, which I did not dislike. Dr. Johnson said, &lsquo;there was too much elaboration in his talk.&rsquo; It gave me pleasure to see him, a steady branch of the family, setting forth all its advantages with much zeal. He told us that Lady Errol was one of the most pious and sensible women in the island; had a good head, and as good a heart. He said, she did not use force or fear in educating her children. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, she is wrong; I would rather have the rod to be the general terror to all, to make them learn, than tell a child if you do thus or thus, you will be more esteemed than your brothers or sisters. The rod produces an effect which terminates in itself. A child is afraid of being whipped, and gets his task, and there&rsquo;s an end on&rsquo;t; whereas, by exciting emulation, and comparisons of superiority, you lay the foundation of lasting mischief; you make brothers and sisters hate each other.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">During Mr. Boyd&rsquo;s stay in Arran, he had found a chest of medical books, left by a surgeon there, and had read them till he acquired some skill in physick, in consequence of which he is often consulted by the poor. There were several here waiting for him as patients. We walked round the house till stopped by a cut made by the influx of the sea. The house is built quite upon the shore; the windows look upon the main ocean, and the King of Denmark is Lord Errol&rsquo;s nearest neighbour on the north-east.</p>
<p class="p24">We got immediately into the coach, and drove to <span class="t8">Dunbui</span>, a rock near the shore, quite covered with sea-fowls; then to a circular bason of large extent, surrounded with tremendous rocks. On the quarter next the sea, there is a high arch in the rock, which the force of the tempest has driven out. This place is called <span class="t8">Buchan&rsquo;s Buller</span>, or the <span class="t8">Buller of Buchan</span>, and the country people call it the <span class="t8">Pot</span>. Mr. Boyd said it was so called from the French <span class="t8">Bouloir</span>. It may be more simply traced from <span class="t8">Boiler</span> in our own language. We walked round this monstrous cauldron. In some places, the rock is very narrow; and on each side there is a sea deep enough for a man of war to ride in; so that it is somewhat horrid to move along. However, there is earth and grass upon the rock, and a kind of road marked out by the print of feet; so that one makes it out pretty safely: yet it alarmed me to see Dr. Johnson striding irregularly along. He insisted on taking a boat, and sailing into the Pot. We did so. He was stout, and wonderfully alert. The Buchan-men all shewing their teeth, and speaking with that strange sharp accent which distinguishes them, was to me a matter of curiosity. He was not sensible of the difference of pronunciation in the South and North of Scotland, which I wondered at.</p>
<p class="p24">As the entry into the <span class="t8">Buller</span> is so narrow that oars cannot be used as you go in, the method taken is, to row very hard when you come near it, and give the boat such a rapidity of motion that it glides in. Dr. Johnson observed what an effect this scene would have had, were we entering into an unknown place. There are caves of considerable depth; I think, one on each side. The boatmen had never entered either of them far enough to know the size. Mr. Boyd told us that it is customary for the company at Peterhead well, to make parties, and come and dine in one of the caves here.</p>
<p class="p24">He told us, that, as Slains is at a considerable distance from Aberdeen, Lord Errol, who has a very large family, resolved to have a surgeon of his own. With this view he educated one of his tenant&rsquo;s sons, who is now settled in a very neat house and farm just by, which we saw from the road. By the salary which the earl allows him, and the practice which he has had, he is in very easy circumstances. He had kept an exact account of all that had been laid out on his education, and he came to his lordship one day, and told him that he had arrived at a much higher situation than ever he expected; that he was now able to repay what his lordship had advanced, and begged he would accept of it. The earl was pleased with the generous gratitude and genteel offer of the man; but refused it. Mr. Boyd also told us, Cumming the Quaker first began to distinguish himself by writing against Dr. Leechman on Prayer, to prove it unnecessary, as GOD knows best what should be, and will order it without our asking: &mdash; the old hackneyed objection.</p>
<p class="p24">When we returned to the house we found coffee and tea in the drawing-room. Lady Errol was not there, being, as I supposed, engaged with her young family. There is a bow-window fronting the sea. Dr. Johnson repeated the ode, <span class="t8">Jam satis terris</span>, while Mr. Boyd was with his patients. He spoke well in favour of entails, to preserve lines of men whom mankind are accustomed to reverence. His opinion was that so much land should be entailed as that families should never fall into contempt, and as much left free as to give them all the advantages of property in case of any emergency. &lsquo;If (said he,) the nobility are suffered to sink into indigence, they of course become corrupt; they are ready to do whatever the king chooses; therefore it is fit they should be kept from becoming poor, unless it is fixed that when they fall below a certain standard of wealth they shall lose their peerages. We know the House of Peers have made noble stands, when the House of Commons durst not. The two last years of parliament they dare not contradict the populace.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">This room is ornamented with a number of fine prints, and with a whole length picture of Lord Errol, by Sir Joshua Reynolds. This led Dr. Johnson and me to talk of our amiable and elegant friend, whose panegyrick he concluded by saying, &lsquo;Sir Joshua Reynolds, Sir, is the most invulnerable man I know; the man with whom if you should quarrel, you would find the most difficulty how to abuse.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Dr. Johnson observed, the situation here was the noblest he had ever seen, &mdash; better than Mount Edgecumbe, reckoned the first in England; because, at Mount Edgecumbe, the sea is bounded by land on the other side, and though there is there the grandeur of a fleet, there is also the impression of there being a dock-yard, the circumstances of which are not agreeable. At Slains is an excellent old house. The noble owner has built of brick, along the square in the inside, a gallery, both on the first and second story, the house being no higher; so that he has always a dry walk, and the rooms, to which formerly there was no approach but through each other, have now all separate entries from the gallery, which is hung with Hogarth&rsquo;s works, and other prints. We went and sat a while in the library. There is a valuable numerous collection. It was chiefly made by Mr. Falconer, husband to the late Countess of Errol in her own right. This earl has added a good many modern books.</p>
<p class="p24">About nine the Earl came home. Captain Gordon of Park was with him. His Lordship put Dr. Johnson in mind of their having dined together in London, along with Mr. Beauclerk. I was exceedingly pleased with Lord Errol. His dignified person and agreeable countenance, with the most unaffected affability, give me high satisfaction. From perhaps a weakness, or, as I rather hope, more fancy and warmth of feeling than is quite reasonable, my mind is ever impressed with admiration for persons of high birth, and I could, with the most perfect honesty, expatiate on Lord Errol&rsquo;s good qualities; but he stands in no need of my praise. His agreeable manners and softness of address prevented that constraint which the idea of his being Lord High Constable of Scotland might otherwise have occasioned. He talked very easily and sensibly with his learned guest. I observed that Dr. Johnson, though he shewed that respect to his lordship, which, from principle, he always does to high rank, yet, when they came to argument, maintained that manliness which becomes the force and vigour of his understanding. To shew external deference to our superiors, is proper: to seem to yield to them in opinion, is meanness. The earl said grace, both before and after supper, with much decency. He told us a story of a man who was executed at Perth, some years ago, for murdering a woman who was with child by him, and a former child he had by her. His hand was cut off: he was then pulled up; but the rope broke, and he was forced to lie an hour on the ground, till another rope was brought from Perth, the execution being in a wood at some distance, &mdash; at the place where the murders were committed. <span class="t8">&lsquo;There</span>,(said my lord,) <span class="t8">I see the hand of Providence</span>.&rsquo; I was really happy here. I saw in this nobleman the best dispositions and best principles; and I saw him, <span class="t8">in my mind&rsquo;s eye</span>, to be the representative of the ancient Boyds of Kilmarnock. I was afraid he might have urged drinking, as, I believe, he used formerly to do; but he drank port and water out of a large glass himself, and let us do as we pleased. He went with us to our rooms at night; said, he took the visit very kindly; and told me, my father and he were very old acquaintance; &mdash; that I now knew the way to Slains, and he hoped to see me there again.</p>
<p class="p24">I had a most elegant room; but there was a fire in it which blazed; and the sea, to which my windows looked, roared; and the pillows were made of the feathers of some sea-fowl, which had to me a disagreeable smell; so that, by all these causes, I was kept awake a good while. I saw, in imagination, Lord Errol&rsquo;s father, Lord Kilmarnock (who was beheaded on Tower-hill in 1746), and I was somewhat dreary. But the thought did not last long, and I fell asleep.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 25.</span></p>
<p class="p21">We got up between seven and eight, and found Mr. Boyd in the dining-room, with tea and coffee before him, to give us breakfast. We were in an admirable humour. Lady Errol had given each of us a copy of an ode by Beattie, on the birth of her son, Lord Hay. Mr. Boyd asked Dr. Johnson how he liked it. Dr. Johnson, who did not admire it, got off very well, by taking it out, and reading the second and third stanzas of it with much melody. This, without his saying a word, pleased Mr. Boyd. He observed, however, to Dr. Johnson, that the expression as to the family of Errol, </p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;A thousand years have seen it shine,&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">compared with what went before, was an anticlimax, and that it would have been better </p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Ages have seen,&rsquo; &amp;c.</p>
<p class="p24">Dr. Johnson said, &lsquo;So great a number as a thousand is better. <span class="t8">Dolus latet in universalibus</span>. Ages might be only two ages.&rsquo; He talked of the advantage of keeping up the connections of relationship, which produce much kindness. &lsquo;Every man (said he,) who comes into the world, has need of friends. If he has to get them for himself, half his life is spent before his merit is known. Relations are a man&rsquo;s ready friends who support him. When a man is in real distress, he flies into the arms of his relations. An old lawyer, who had much experience in making wills, told me, that after people had deliberated long, and thought of many for their executors, they settled at last by fixing on their relations. This shews the universality of the principle.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I regretted the decay of respect for men of family, and that a Nabob now would carry an election from them. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, the Nabob will carry it by means of his wealth, in a country where money is highly valued, as it must be where nothing can be had without money; but, if it comes to personal preference, the man of family will always carry it. There is generally a <span class="t8">scoundrelism</span> about a low man.&rsquo; Mr. Boyd said, that was a good <span class="t8">ism</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">I said, I believed mankind were happier in the ancient feudal state of subordination, than they are in the modern state of independency. JOHNSON. &lsquo;To be sure, the <span class="t8">Chief</span> was: but we must think of the number of individuals. That <span class="t8">they</span> were less happy, seems plain; for that state from which all escape as soon as they can, and to which none return after they have left it, must be less happy; and this is the case with the state of dependance on a chief or great man.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I mentioned the happiness of the French in their subordination, by the reciprocal benevolence and attachment between the great and those in lower rank. Mr. Boyd gave us an instance of their gentlemanly spirit. An old Chevalier de Malthe, of ancient <span class="t8">noblesse</span>, but in low circumstances, was in a coffee-house at Paris, where was Julien, the great manufacturer at the Gobelins, of the fine tapestry, so much distinguished both for the figures and the <span class="t8">colours</span>. The chevalier&rsquo;s carriage was very old. Says Julien, with a plebeian insolence, &lsquo;I think, Sir, you had better have your carriage new painted.&rsquo; The chevalier looked at him with indignant contempt, and answered, &lsquo;Well, Sir, you may take it home and <span class="t8">dye</span> it!&rsquo; All the coffee-house rejoiced at Julien&rsquo;s confusion.</p>
<p class="p24">We set out about nine. Dr. Johnson was curious to see one of those structures which northern antiquarians call a Druid&rsquo;s temple. I had a recollection of one at Strichen; which I had seen fifteen years ago; so we went four miles out of our road, after passing Old Deer, and went thither. Mr. Fraser, the proprietor, was at home, and shewed it to us. But I had augmented it in my mind; for all that remains is two stones set up on end, with a long one laid upon them, as was usual, and one stone at a little distance from them. That stone was the capital one of the circle which surrounded what now remains. Mr. Fraser was very hospitable. There was a fair at Strichen; and he had several of his neighbours from it at dinner. One of them, Dr. Fraser, who had been in the army, remembered to have seen Dr. Johnson at a lecture on experimental philosophy, at Lichfield. The doctor recollected being at the lecture; and he was surprised to find here somebody who knew him.</p>
<p class="p24">Mr. Fraser sent a servant to conduct us by a short passage into the high-road. I observed to Dr. Johnson, that I had a most disagreeable notion of the life of country gentlemen; that I left Mr. Fraser just now, as one leaves a prisoner in a jail. Dr. Johnson said, that I was right in thinking them unhappy; for that they had not enough to keep their minds in motion.</p>
<p class="p24">I started a thought this afternoon which amused us a great part of the way. &lsquo;If, (said I,) our club should come and set up in St. Andrews, as a college, to teach all that each of us can, in the several departments of learning and taste, we should rebuild the city: we should draw a wonderful concourse of students.&rsquo; Dr. Johnson entered fully into the spirit of this project. We immediately fell to distributing the offices. I was to teach Civil and Scotch law; Burke, politicks and eloquence; Garrick, the art of publick speaking; Langton was to be our Grecian, Colman our Latin professor; Nugent to teach physick; Lord Charlemont, modern history; Beauclerk, natural philosophy; Vesey, Irish antiquities, or Celtick learning; Jones, Oriental learning; Goldsmith, poetry and ancient history; Chamier, commercial politicks; Reynolds, painting, and the arts which have beauty for their object; Chambers, the law of England. Dr. Johnson at first said, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll trust theology to nobody but myself.&rsquo; But, upon due consideration, that Percy is a clergyman, it was agreed that Percy should teach practical divinity and British antiquities; Dr. Johnson himself, logick, metaphysicks, and scholastick divinity. In this manner did we amuse ourselves; &mdash; each suggesting, and each varying or adding, till the whole was adjusted. Dr. Johnson said, we only wanted a mathematician since Dyer died, who was a very good one; but as to every thing else, we should have a very capital university.</p>
<p class="p24">We got at night to Banff. I sent Joseph on to Duff-house; but Earl Fife was not at home, which I regretted much, as we should have had a very elegant reception from his lordship. We found here but an indifferent inn. Dr. Johnson wrote a long letter to Mrs. Thrale. I wondered to see him write so much so easily. He verified his own doctrine that &lsquo;a man may always write when he will set himself <span class="t8">doggedly</span> to it.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">THURSDAY, AUGUST 26.</span></p>
<p class="p21">We got a fresh chaise here, a very good one, and very good horses. We breakfasted at Cullen. They set down dried haddocks broiled, along with our tea. I ate one; but Dr. Johnson was disgusted by the sight of them, so they were removed. Cullen has a comfortable appearance, though but a very small town, and the houses mostly poor buildings.</p>
<p class="p24">I called on Mr. Robertson, who has the charge of Lord Findlater&rsquo;s affairs, and was formerly Lord Monboddo&rsquo;s clerk, was three times in France with him, and translated Condamine&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Account of the Savage Girl</span>, to which his lordship wrote a preface, containing several remarks of his own. Robertson said, he did not believe so much as his lordship did; that it was plain to him, the girl confounded what she imagined with what she remembered: that, besides, she perceived Condamine and Lord Monboddo forming theories, and she adapted her story to them.</p>
<p class="p24">Dr. Johnson said, &lsquo;It is a pity to see Lord Monboddo publish such notions as he has done; a man of sense, and of so much elegant learning. There would be little in a fool doing it; we should only laugh; but when a wise man does it, we are sorry. Other people have strange notions; but they conceal them. If they have tails, they hide them; but Monboddo is as jealous of his tail as a squirrel.&rsquo; I shall here put down some more remarks of Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s on Lord Monboddo, which were not made exactly at this time, but come in well from connection. He said, he did not approve of a judge&rsquo;s calling himself <span class="t8">Farmer</span> Burnett, and going about with a little round hat. He laughed heartily at his lordship&rsquo;s saying he was an <span class="t8">enthusiastical</span> farmer; &lsquo;for, (said he,) what can he do in farming by his <span class="t8">enthusiasm</span>?&rsquo; Here, however, I think Dr. Johnson mistaken. He who wishes to be successful, or happy, ought to be enthusiastical, that is to say, very keen in all the occupations or diversions of life. An ordinary gentleman-farmer will be satisfied with looking at his fields once or twice a day: an enthusiastical farmer will be constantly employed on them; will have his mind earnestly engaged; will talk perpetually, of them. But Dr. Johnson has much of the <span class="t8">nil admirari</span> in smaller concerns. That survey of life which gave birth to his <span class="t8">Vanity of Human Wishes</span> early sobered his mind. Besides, so great a mind as his cannot be moved by inferior objects: an elephant does not run and skip like lesser animals. Mr. Robertson sent a servant with us, to shew us through Lord Findlater&rsquo;s wood, by which our way was shortened, and we saw some part of his domain, which is indeed admirably laid out. Dr. Johnson did not choose to walk through it. He always said, that he was not come to Scotland to see fine places, of which there were enough in England; but wild objects, &mdash; mountains, &mdash; waterfalls, &mdash; peculiar manners; in short, things which he had not seen before. I have a notion that he at no time has had much taste for rural beauties. I have myself very little.</p>
<p class="p24">Dr. Johnson said, there was nothing more contemptible than a country gentleman living beyond his income, and every year growing poorer and poorer. He spoke strongly of the influence which a man has by being rich. &lsquo;A man, (said he,) who keeps his money, has in reality more use from it, than he can have by spending it.&rsquo; I observed that this looked very like a paradox; but he explained it thus: &lsquo;If it were certain that a man would keep his money locked up for ever, to be sure he would have no influence; but, as so many want money, and he has the power of giving it, and they know not but by gaining his favour they may obtain it, the rich man will always have the greatest influence. He again who lavishes his money, is laughed at as foolish, and in a great degree with justice, considering how much is spent from vanity. Even those who partake of a man&rsquo;s hospitality, have but a transient kindness for him. If he has not the command of money, people know he cannot help them, if he would; whereas the rich man always can, if he will, and for the chance of that, will have much weight.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;But philosophers and satirists have all treated a miser as contemptible.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;He is so philosophically; but not in the practice of life.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Let me see now: &mdash; I do not know the instances of misers in England, so as to examine into their influence.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;We have had few misers in England.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;There was Lowther.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, Lowther, by keeping his money, had the command of the county, which the family has now lost, by spending it; I take it he lent a great deal; and that is the way to have influence, and yet preserve one&rsquo;s wealth. A man may lend his money upon very good security, and yet have his debtor much under his power.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;No doubt, Sir. He can always distress him for the money; as no man borrows, who is able to pay on demand quite conveniently.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">We dined at Elgin, and saw the noble ruins of the cathedral. Though it rained much, Dr. Johnson examined them with a most patient attention. He could not here feel any abhorrence at the Scottish reformers, for he had been told by Lord Hailes, that it was destroyed before the Reformation, by the Lord of Badenoch, who had a quarrel with the bishop. The bishop&rsquo;s house, and those of the other clergy, which are still pretty entire, do not seem to have been proportioned to the magnificence of the cathedral, which has been of great extent, and had very fine carved work. The ground within the walls of the cathedral is employed as a burying-place. The family of Gordon have their vault here; but it has nothing grand.</p>
<p class="p24">We passed Gordon Castle this forenoon, which has a princely appearance. Fochabers, the neighbouring village, is a poor place, many of the houses being ruinous; but it is remarkable, they have in general orchards well stored with apple-trees. Elgin has what in England are called piazzas, that run in many places on each side of the street. It must have been a much better place formerly. Probably it had piazzas all along the town, as I have seen at Bologna. I approved much of such structures in a town, on account of their conveniency in wet weather. Dr. Johnson disapproved of them, &lsquo;because (said he) it makes the under story of a house very dark, which greatly over-balances the conveniency, when it is considered how small a part of the year it rains; how few are usually in the street at such times; that many who are might as well be at home; and the little that people suffer, supposing them to be as much wet as they commonly are in walking a street.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">We fared but ill at our inn here; and Dr. Johnson said, this was the first time he had seen a dinner in Scotland that he could not eat.</p>
<p class="p24">In the afternoon, we drove over the very heath where Macbeth met the witches, according to tradition. Dr. Johnson again solemnly repeated &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;How far is&rsquo;t called to Fores? What are these,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So wither&rsquo;d, and so wild in their attire?</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That look not like the inhabitants o&rsquo; the earth,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet are on&rsquo;t?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He repeated a good deal more of Macbeth. His recitation was grand and affecting, and as Sir Joshua Reynolds has observed to me, had no more tone than it should have: it was the better for it. He then parodied the <span class="t8">All-hail</span> of the witches to Macbeth, addressing himself to me. I had purchased some land called <span class="t8">Dalblair</span>; and, as in Scotland it is customary to distinguish landed men by the name of their estates, I had thus two titles, <span class="t8">Dalblair</span> and Young <span class="t8">Auchinleck</span>. So my friend, in imitation of </p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;All hail, Macbeth! hail to thee, Thane of Cawdor!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">condescended to amuse himself with uttering </p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;All hail, Dalblair! hail to thee, Laird of Auchinleck!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">We got to Fores at night, and found an admirable inn, in which Dr. Johnson was pleased to meet with a landlord who styled himself &lsquo;Wine-Cooper, from LONDON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">FRIDAY, AUGUST 27.</span></p>
<p class="p21">It was dark when we came to Fores last night; so we did not see what is called King Duncan&rsquo;s monument. I shall now mark some gleanings of Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s conversation. I spoke of <span class="t8">Leonidas</span>, and said there were some good passages in it. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, you must <span class="t8">seek</span> for them.&rsquo; He said, Paul Whitehead&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Manners</span> was a poor performance. Speaking of Derrick, he told me &lsquo;he had a kindness for him, and had often said, that if his letters had been written by one of a more established name, they would have been thought very pretty letters.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">This morning I introduced the subject of the origin of evil. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Moral evil is occasioned by free will, which implies choice between good and evil. With all the evil that there is, there is no man but would rather be a free agent, than a mere machine without the evil; and what is best for each individual, must be best for the whole. If a man would rather be the machine, I cannot argue with him. He is a different being from me.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;A man, as a machine, may have agreeable sensations; for instance, he may have pleasure in musick.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;No, Sir, he cannot have pleasure in musick; at least no power of producing musick; for he who can produce musick may let it alone: he who can play upon a fiddle may break it: such a man is not a machine.&rsquo; This reasoning satisfied me. It is certain, there cannot be a free agent, unless there is the power of being evil as well as good. We must take the inherent possibilities of things into consideration, in our reasonings or conjectures concerning the works of GOD.</p>
<p class="p24">We came to Nairn to breakfast. Though a county town and a royal burgh, it is a miserable place. Over the room where we sat, a girl was spinning wool with a great wheel, and singing an Erse song: &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll warrant you, (said Dr. Johnson.) one of the songs of Ossian.&rsquo; He then repeated these lines: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Verse sweetens toil, however rude the sound.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All at her work the village maiden sings;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor while she turns the giddy wheel around,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revolves the sad vicissitude of things.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I thought I had heard these lines before. JOHNSON. &lsquo;I fancy not, Sir; for they are in a detached poem, the name of which I do not remember, written by one Giffard, a parson.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I expected Mr. Kenneth M&rsquo;Aulay, the minister of Calder, who published the history of St. Kilda, a book which Dr. Johnson liked, would have met us here, as I had written to him from Aberdeen. But I received a letter from him, telling me that he could not leave home, as he was to administer the sacrament the following Sunday, and earnestly requesting to see us at his manse. &lsquo;We&rsquo;ll go,&rsquo; said Dr. Johnson; which we accordingly did. Mrs. M&rsquo;Aulay received us, and told us her husband was in the church distributing tokens. We arrived between twelve and one o&rsquo;clock, and it was near three before he came to us.</p>
<p class="p24">Dr. Johnson thanked him for his book, and said &lsquo;it was a very pretty piece of topography.&rsquo; M&rsquo;Aulay did not seem much to mind the compliment. From his conversation, Dr. Johnson was persuaded that he had not written the book which goes under his name. I myself always suspected so; and I have been told it was written by the learned Dr. John M&rsquo;Pherson of Sky, from the materials collected by M&rsquo;Aulay. Dr. Johnson said privately to me, &lsquo;There is a combination in it of which M&rsquo;Aulay is not capable.&rsquo; However, he was exceedingly hospitable; and, as he obligingly promised us a route for our Tour through the Western Isles, we agreed to stay with him all night.</p>
<p class="p24">After dinner, we walked to the old castle of Calder (pronounced Cawder), the Thane of Cawdor&rsquo;s seat. I was sorry that my friend, this &lsquo;prosperous gentleman,&rsquo; was not there. The old tower must be of great antiquity. There is a draw-bridge &mdash; what has been a moat, &mdash; and an ancient court. There is a hawthorn-tree, which rises like a wooden pillar through the rooms of the castle; for, by a strange conceit, the walls have been built round it. The thickness of the walls, the small slaunting windows, and a great iron door at the entrance on the second story as you ascend the stairs, all indicate the rude times in which this castle was erected. There were here some large venerable trees.</p>
<p class="p24">I was afraid of a quarrel between Dr. Johnson and Mr. M&rsquo;Aulay, who talked slightingly of the lower English clergy. The Doctor gave him a frowning look, and said, &lsquo;This is a day of novelties; I have seen old trees in Scotland, and I have heard the English clergy treated with disrespect.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I dreaded that a whole evening at Calder manse would be heavy; however, Mr. Grant, an intelligent and well-bred minister in the neighbourhood, was there, and assisted us by his conversation. Dr. Johnson, talking of hereditary occupations in the Highlands, said, &lsquo;There is no harm in such a custom as this; but it is wrong to enforce it, and oblige a man to be a taylor or a smith, because his father has been one.&rsquo; This custom, however, is not peculiar to our Highlands; it is well known that in India a similar practice prevails.</p>
<p class="p24">Mr. M&rsquo;Aulay began a rhapsody against creeds and confessions. Dr. Johnson shewed, that &lsquo;what he called <span class="t8">imposition</span>, was only a voluntary declaration of agreement in certain articles of faith, which a church has a right to require, just as any other society can insist on certain rules being observed by its members. Nobody is compelled to be of the church, as nobody is compelled to enter into a society.&rsquo; This was a very clear and just view of the subject: but, M&rsquo;Aulay could not be driven out of his track. Dr. Johnson said, &lsquo;Sir, you are a <span class="t8">bigot to laxness</span>.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Mr. M&rsquo;Aulay and I laid the map of Scotland before us; and he pointed out a route for us from Inverness, by Fort Augustus, to Glenelg, Sky, Mull, Icolmkill, Lorn, and Inverary, which I wrote down. As my father was to begin the northern circuit about the 18th of September, it was necessary for us either to make our tour with great expedition, so as to get to Auchinleck before he set out, or to protract it, so as not to be there till his return, which would be about the 10th of October. By M&rsquo;Aulay&rsquo;s calculation, we were not to land in Lorn till the 2Oth of September. I thought that the interruptions by bad days, or by occasional excursions, might make it ten days later; and I thought too, that we might perhaps go to Benbecula, and visit Clanranald, which would take a week of itself.</p>
<p class="p24">Dr. Johnson went up with Mr. Grant to the library, which consisted of a tolerable collection; but the Doctor thought it rather a lady&rsquo;s library, with some Latin books in it by chance, than the library of a clergyman. It had only two of the Latin fathers, and one of the Greek fathers in Latin. I doubted whether Dr. Johnson would be present at a Presbyterian prayer. I told Mr. M&rsquo;Aulay so, and said that the Doctor might sit in the library while we were at family worship. Mr. M&rsquo;Aulay said, he would omit it, rather than give Dr. Johnson offence: but I would by no means agree that an excess of politeness, even to so great a man, should prevent what I esteem as one of the best pious regulations. I know nothing more beneficial, more comfortable, more agreeable, than that the little societies of each family should regularly assemble, and unite in praise and prayer to our heavenly Father, from whom we daily receive so much good, and may hope for more in a higher state of existence. I mentioned to Dr. Johnson the over-delicate scrupulosity of our host. He said, he had no objection to hear the prayer. This was a pleasing surprise to me; for he refused to go and hear Principal Robertson preach. &lsquo;I will hear him, (said he,) if he will get up into a tree and preach; but I will not give a sanction, by my presence, to a Presbyterian assembly.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Mr. Grant having prayed, Dr. Johnson said, his prayer was a very good one; but objected to his not having introduced the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer. He told us, that an Italian of some note in London said once to him, &lsquo;We have in our service a prayer called the <span class="t8">Pater Noster</span>, which is a very fine composition. I wonder who is the author of it.&rsquo; A singular instance of ignorance in a man of some literature and general inquiry!</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">SATURDAY, AUGUST 28.</span></p>
<p class="p21">Dr. Johnson had brought a <span class="t8">Sallust</span> with him in his pocket from Edinburgh. He gave it last night to Mr. M&rsquo;Aulay&rsquo;s son, a smart young lad about eleven years old. Dr. Johnson had given an account of the education at Oxford, in all its gradations. The advantage of being a servitor to a youth of little fortune struck Mrs. M&rsquo;Aulay much. I observed it aloud. Dr. Johnson very handsomely and kindly said, that, if they would send their boy to him, when he was ready for the university, he would get him made a servitor, and perhaps would do more for him. He could not promise to do more; but would undertake for the servitorship.</p>
<p class="p24">I should have mentioned that Mr. White, a Welshman, who has been many years factor (i.e. steward) on the estate of Calder, drank tea with us last night, and upon getting a note from Mr. M&rsquo;Aulay, asked us to his house. We had not time to accept of his invitation. He gave us a letter of introduction to Mr. Ferne, master of stores at Fort George. He shewed it to me. It recommended &lsquo;two celebrated gentlemen; no less than Dr. Johnson, <span class="t8">author of his Dictionary</span>, &mdash; and Mr. Boswell, known at Edinburgh by the name of Paoli.&rsquo; He said he hoped I had no objection to what he had written; if I had, he would alter it. I thought it was a pity to check his effusions, and acquiesced; taking care, however, to seal the letter, that it might not appear that I had read it.</p>
<p class="p24">A conversation took place about saying grace at breakfast (as we do in Scotland) as well as at dinner and supper; in which Dr. Johnson said, &lsquo;It is enough if we have stated seasons of prayer; no matter when. A man may as well pray when he mounts his horse, or a woman when she milks her cow, (which Mr. Grant told us is done in the Highlands,) as at meals; and custom is to be followed.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">We proceeded to Fort George. When we came into the square, I sent a soldier with the letter to Mr. Ferne. He came to us immediately, and along with him came Major <span class="t8">Brewse</span> of the Engineers, pronounced <span class="t8">Bruce</span>. He said he believed it was originally the same Norman name with Bruce. That he had dined at a house in London, where were three Bruces, one of the Irish line, one of the Scottish line, and himself of the English line. He said he was shewn it in the Herald&rsquo;s office spelt fourteen different ways. I told him the different spellings of my name. Dr Johnson observed, that there had been great disputes about the spelling of Shakspear&rsquo;s name; at last it was thought it would be settled by looking at the original copy of his will; but, upon examining it, he was found to have written it himself no less than three different ways.</p>
<p class="p24">Mr. Ferne and Major Brewse first carried us to wait on Sir Eyre Coote, whose regiment, the 37th, was lying here, and who then commanded the fort. He asked us to dine with him, which we agreed to do.</p>
<p class="p24">Before dinner we examined the fort. The Major explained the fortification to us, and Mr. Ferne gave us an account of the stores. Dr. Johnson talked of the proportions of charcoal and salt-petre in making gunpowder, of granulating it, and of giving it a gloss. He made a very good figure upon these topicks. He said to me afterwards, that &lsquo;he had talked <span class="t8">ostentatiously</span>.&rsquo; We reposed ourselves a little in Mr. Ferne&rsquo;s house. He had every thing in neat order as in England; and a tolerable collection of books. I looked into Pennant&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Tour in Scotland</span>. He says little of this fort; but that &lsquo;the barracks, &amp;c. form several streets.&rsquo; This is aggrandising. Mr. Ferne observed, if he had said they form a square, with a row of buildings before it, he would have given a juster description. Dr. Johnson remarked, &lsquo;how seldom descriptions correspond with realities; and the reason is, that people do not write them till some time after, and then their imagination has added circumstances.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">We talked of Sir Adolphus Oughton. The Major said, he knew a great deal for a military man. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, you will find few men, of any profession, who know more. Sir Adolphus is a very extraordinary man; a man of boundless curiosity and unwearied diligence.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I know not how the Major contrived to introduce the contest between Warburton and Lowth. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Warburton kept his temper all along, while Lowth was in a passion. Lowth published some of Warburton&rsquo;s letters. Warburton drew <span class="t8">him</span> on to write some very abusive letters, and then asked his leave to publish them; which he knew Lowth could not refuse, after what <span class="t8">he</span> had done. So that Warburton contrived that he should publish, apparently with Lowth&rsquo;s consent, what could not but shew Lowth in a disadvantageous light.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">At three the drum beat for dinner. I, for a little while, fancied myself a military man, and it pleased me. We went to Sir Eyre Coote&rsquo;s, at the governour&rsquo;s house, and found him a most gentleman-like man. His lady is a very agreeable woman, with an uncommonly mild and sweet tone of voice. There was a pretty large company: Mr. Ferne, Major Brewse, and several officers. Sir Eyre had come from the East-Indies by land, through the Desarts of Arabia. He told us, the Arabs could live five days without victuals, and subsist for three weeks on nothing else but the blood of their camels, who could lose so much of it as would suffice for that time, without being exhausted. He highly praised the virtue of the Arabs; their fidelity, if they undertook to conduct any person; and said, they would sacrifice their lives rather than let him be robbed. Dr. Johnson, who is always for maintaining the superiority of civilized over uncivilized men, said, &lsquo;Why, Sir, I can see no superiour virtue in this. A serjeant and twelve men, who are my guard, will die, rather than that I shall be robbed.&rsquo; Colonel Pennington, of the 37th regiment, took up the argument with a good deal of spirit and ingenuity. PENNINGTON. &lsquo;But the soldiers are compelled to this by fear of punishment. &lsquo;JOHNSON. &lsquo;Well, Sir, the Arabs are compelled by the fear of infamy.&rsquo; PENNINGTON. &lsquo;The soldiers have the same fear of infamy, and the fear of punishment besides; so have less virtue; because they act less voluntarily.&rsquo; Lady Coote observed very well, that it ought to be known if there was not, among the Arabs, some punishment for not being faithful on such occasions.</p>
<p class="p24">We talked of the stage. I observed, that we had not now such a company of actors as in the last age; Wilks, Booth, &amp;c. &amp;c. JOHNSON. &lsquo;You think so, because there is one who excels all the rest so much: you compare them with Garrick, and see the deficiency. Garrick&rsquo;s great distinction is his universality. He can represent all modes of life, but that of an easy fine bred gentleman.&rsquo; PENNINGTON. &lsquo;He should give over playing young parts.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;He does not take them now; but he does not leave off those which he has been used to play, because he does them better than any one else can do them. If you had generations of actors, if they swarmed like bees, the young ones might drive off the old. Mrs. Cibber, I think, got more reputation than she deserved, as she had a great sameness; though her expression was undoubtedly very fine. Mrs. Clive was the best player I ever saw. Mrs. Prichard was a very good one; but she had something affected in her manner: I imagine she had some player of the former age in her eye, which occasioned it.&rsquo; Colonel Pennington said, Garrick sometimes failed in emphasis; as for instance, in <span class="t8">Hamlet</span>, </p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;I will speak <span class="t8">daggers</span> to her; but use <span class="t8">none</span>.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">instead of </p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;I will <span class="t8">speak</span> daggers to her; but <span class="t8">use</span> none.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">We had a dinner of two complete courses, variety of wines, and the regimental band of musick playing in the square, before the windows, after it. I enjoyed this day much. We were quite easy and cheerful. Dr. Johnson said, &lsquo;I shall always remember this fort with gratitude.&rsquo; I could not help being struck with some admiration, at finding upon this barren sandy point, such buildings, &mdash; such a dinner, &mdash; such company: it was like enchantment. Dr. Johnson, on the other hand, said to me more rationally, that &lsquo;it did not strike <span class="t8">him</span> as any thing extraordinary; because he knew, here was a large sum of money expended in building a fort; here was a regiment. If there had been less than what we found, it would have surprised him.&rsquo; <span class="t8">He</span> looked coolly and deliberately through all the gradations: my warm imagination jumped from the barren sands to the splendid dinner and brilliant company, to borrow the expression of an absurd poet, </p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Without ands or ifs,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I leapt from off the sands upon the cliffs.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">The whole scene gave me a strong impression of the power and excellence of human art.</p>
<p class="p24">We left the fort between six and seven o&rsquo;clock: Sir Eyre Coote, Colonel Pennington, and several more accompanied us down stairs, and saw us into our chaise. There could not be greater attention paid to any visitors. Sir Eyre spoke of the hardships which Dr. Johnson had before him. BOSWELL. &lsquo;Considering what he has said of us, we must make him feel something rough in Scotland.&rsquo; Sir Eyre said to him, &lsquo;You must change your name, Sir.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Ay, to Dr. M&rsquo;Gregor.&rsquo; We got safely to Inverness, and put up at Mackenzie&rsquo;s inn. Mr. Keith, the collector of Excise here, my old acquaintance at Ayr, who had seen us at the Fort, visited us in the evening, and engaged us to dine with him next day, promising to breakfast with us, and take us to the English chapel; so that we were at once commodiously arranged.</p>
<p class="p24">Not finding a letter here that I expected, I felt a momentary impatience to be at home. Transient clouds darkened my imagination, and in those clouds I saw events from which I shrunk; but a sentence or two of the <span class="t8">Rambler&rsquo;s</span> conversation gave me firmness, and I considered that I was upon an expedition for which I had wished for years, and the recollection of which would be a treasure to me for life.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">SUNDAY, AUGUST 29.</span></p>
<p class="p21">Mr. Keith breakfasted with us. Dr. Johnson expatiated rather too strongly upon the benefits derived to Scotland from the Union, and the bad state of our people before it. I am entertained with his copious exaggeration upon that subject; but I am uneasy when people are by, who do not know him as well as I do, and may be apt to think him narrow-minded. I therefore diverted the subject.</p>
<p class="p24">The English chapel, to which we went this morning, was but mean. The altar was a bare fir table, with a coarse stool for kneeling on, covered with a piece of thick sail-cloth doubled, by way of cushion. The congregation was small. Mr. Tait, the clergyman, read prayers very well, though with much of the Scotch accent. He preached on &lsquo;<span class="t8">Love your Enemies</span>.&rsquo; It was remarkable that, when talking of the connections amongst men, he said, that some connected themselves with men of distinguished talents, and since they could not equal them, tried to deck themselves with their merit, by being their companions. The sentence was to this purpose. It had an odd coincidence with what might be said of my connecting myself with Dr. Johnson.</p>
<p class="p24">After church we walked down to the Quay. We then went to Macbeth&rsquo;s castle. I had a romantick satisfaction in seeing Dr. Johnson actually in it. It perfectly corresponds with Shakspear&rsquo;s description, which Sir Joshua Reynolds has so happily illustrated, in one of his notes on our immortal poet: </p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;This castle hath a pleasant seat: the air</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nimbly and sweetly recommends itself</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unto our gentle sense,&rsquo; &amp;c.</p>
<p class="p24">Just as we came out of it, a raven perched on one of the chimney-tops, and croaked. Then I repeated </p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo; &mdash;&mdash; The raven himself is hoarse,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That croaks the fatal entrance of Duncan</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under my battlements.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">We dined at Mr. Keith&rsquo;s. Mrs. Keith was rather too attentive to Dr. Johnson, asking him many questions about his drinking only water. He repressed that observation, by saying to me, &lsquo;You may remember that Lady Errol took no notice of this.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Dr. Johnson has the happy art (for which I have heard my father praise the old Earl of Aberdeen) of instructing himself, by making every man he meets tell him something of what he knows best. He led Keith to talk to him of the Excise in Scotland, and, in the course of conversation, mentioned that his friend Mr. Thrale, the great brewer, paid twenty thousand pounds a year to the revenue; and that he had four casks, each of which holds sixteen hundred barrels, &mdash; above a thousand hogsheads. </p>
<p class="p24">After this there was little conversation that deserves to be remembered.</p>
<p class="p24">I shall therefore here again glean what I have omitted on former days.</p>
<p class="p24">Dr. Gerrard, at Aberdeen, told us, that when he was in Wales, he was</p>
<p class="p24">shewn a valley inhabited by Danes, who still retain their own language,</p>
<p class="p24">and are quite a distinct people. Dr. Johnson thought it could not be</p>
<p class="p24">true, or all the kingdom must have heard of it. He said to me, as we</p>
<p class="p24">travelled, &lsquo;these people, Sir, that Gerrard talks of, may have somewhat</p>
<p class="p24">of a <span class="t8">peregrinity</span> in their dialect, which relation has augmented to a</p>
<p class="p24">different language.&rsquo; I asked him if <span class="t8">peregrinity</span> was an English word:</p>
<p class="p24">he laughed, and said, &lsquo;No.&rsquo; I told him this was the second time that I</p>
<p class="p24">had heard him coin a word. When Foote broke his leg, I observed</p>
<p class="p24">that it would make him fitter for taking off George Faulkner as Peter</p>
<p class="p24">Paragraph, poor George having a wooden leg. Dr. Johnson at that</p>
<p class="p24">time said, &lsquo;George will rejoice at the <span class="t8">depeditation</span> of Foote;&rsquo; and</p>
<p class="p24">when I challenged that word, laughed, and owned he had made it, and</p>
<p class="p24">added that he had not made above three or four in his <span class="t8">Dictionary</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">Having conducted Dr. Johnson to our inn, I begged permission to leave</p>
<p class="p24">him for a little, that I might run about and pay some short visits to</p>
<p class="p24">several good people of Inverness. He said to me &lsquo;You have all the</p>
<p class="p24">old-fashioned principles, good and bad&rsquo; I acknowledge I have. That of</p>
<p class="p24">attention to relations in the remotest degree, or to worthy persons, in</p>
<p class="p24">every state whom I have once known, I inherit from my father. It gave me</p>
<p class="p24">much satisfaction to hear every body at Inverness speak of him with</p>
<p class="p24">uncommon regard. Mr. Keith and Mr. Grant, whom we had seen at Mr.</p>
<p class="p24">M&rsquo;Aulay&rsquo;s, supped with us at the inn. We had roasted kid, which Dr.</p>
<p class="p24"><a id="a2664"></a>Johnson had never tasted before. He relished it much.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">MONDAY, AUGUST 30.</span></p>
<p class="p21">This day we were to begin our <span class="t8">equitation,</span> as I said; for <span class="t8">I</span> would needs make a word too. It is remarkable, that my noble, and to me most constant friend, the Earl of Pembroke, (who, if there is too much ease on my part, will please to pardon what his benevolent, gay, social intercourse, and lively correspondence have insensibly produced,) has since hit upon the very same word. The title of the first edition of his lordship&rsquo;s very useful book was, in simple terms, <span class="t8">A Method of breaking Horses and teaching Soldiers to ride.</span> The title of the second edition is, &lsquo;MILITARY EQUITATION.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">We might have taken a chaise to Fort Augustus, but, had we not hired horses at Inverness, we should not have found them afterwards: so we resolved to begin here to ride. We had three horses, for Dr. Johnson, myself, and Joseph, and one which carried our portmanteaus, and two Highlanders who walked along with us, John Hay and Lauchland Vass, whom Dr. Johnson has remembered with credit in his JOURNEY, though he has omitted their names. Dr. Johnson rode very well. About three miles beyond Inverness, we saw, just by the road, a very complete specimen of what is called a Druid&rsquo;s temple. There was a double circle, one of very large, the other of smaller stones. Dr. Johnson justly observed, that &lsquo;to go and see one druidical temple is only to see that it is nothing, for there is neither art nor power in it; and seeing one is quite enough.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">It was a delightful day. Lochness, and the road upon the side of it, shaded with birch trees, and the hills above it, pleased us much. The scene was as sequestered and agreeably wild as could be desired, and for a time engrossed all our attention.</p>
<p class="p24">To see Dr. Johnson in any new situation is always an interesting object to me; and, as I saw him now for the first time on horseback, jaunting about at his ease in quest of pleasure and novelty, the very different occupations of his former laborious life, his admirable productions, his <span class="t8">London</span>, his <span class="t8">Rambler</span>, &amp;c. &amp;c., immediately presented themselves to my mind, and the contrast made a strong impression on my imagination.</p>
<p class="p24">When we had advanced a good way by the side of Lochness, I perceived a little hut, with an old-looking woman at the door of it. I thought here might be a scene that would amuse Dr. Johnson; so I mentioned it to him. &lsquo;Let&rsquo;s go in,&rsquo; said he. We dismounted, and we and our guides entered the hut. It was a wretched little hovel of earth only, I think, and for a window had only a small hole, which was stopped with a piece of turf, that was taken out occasionally to let in light. In the middle of the room or space which we entered, was a fire of peat, the smoke going out at a hole in the roof. She had a pot upon it, with goat&rsquo;s flesh, boiling. There was at one end under the same roof, but divided by a kind of partition made of wattles, a pen or fold in which we saw a good many kids.</p>
<p class="p24">Dr. Johnson was curious to know where she slept. I asked one of the guides, who questioned her in Erse. She answered with a tone of emotion, saying, (as he told us,) she was afraid we wanted to go to bed to her. This <span class="t8">coquetry</span>, or whatever it may be called, of so wretched a being, was truly ludicrous. Dr. Johnson and I afterwards were merry upon it. I said it was he who alarmed the poor woman&rsquo;s virtue. &lsquo;No, Sir, (said he,) she&rsquo;ll say &ldquo;there came a wicked young fellow, a wild dog, who I believe would have ravished me, had there not been with him a grave old gentleman, who repressed him: but when he gets out of the sight of his tutor, I&rsquo;ll warrant you he&rsquo;ll spare no woman he meets, young or old.&rdquo;&rsquo; &lsquo;No, Sir, (I replied,) she&rsquo;ll say, &ldquo;There was a terrible ruffian who would have forced me, had it not been for a civil decent young man who, I take it, was an angel sent from heaven to protect me.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Dr. Johnson would not hurt her delicacy, by insisting on &lsquo;seeing her bed-chamber,&rsquo; like <span class="t8">Archer</span> in the <span class="t8">Beaux Stratagem</span>. But my curiosity was more ardent; I lighted a piece of paper, and went into the place where the bed was. There was a little partition of wicker, rather more neatly done than that for the fold, and close by the wall was a kind of bedstead of wood with heath upon it by way of bed! at the foot of which I saw some sort of blankets or covering rolled up in a heap. The woman&rsquo;s name was Fraser; so was her husband&rsquo;s. He was a man of eighty. Mr. Fraser of Balnain allows him to live in this hut, and keep sixty goats, for taking care of his woods, where he then was. They had five children, the eldest only thirteen. Two were gone to Inverness to buy meal; the rest were looking after the goats. This contented family had four stacks of barley, twenty-four sheaves in each. They had a few fowls. We were informed that they lived all the spring without meal, upon milk and curds and whey alone. What they get for their goats, kids, and fowls, maintains them during the rest of the year. She asked us to sit down and take a dram. I saw one chair. She said she was as happy as any woman in Scotland. She could hardly speak any English except a few detached words. Dr. Johnson was pleased at seeing, for the first time, such a state of human life. She asked for snuff. It is her luxury, and she uses a great deal. We had none; but gave her sixpence a piece. She then brought out her whiskey bottle. I tasted it; as did Joseph and our guides, so I gave her sixpence more. She sent us away with many prayers in Erse.</p>
<p class="p24">We dined at a publick house called the General&rsquo;s Hut, from General Wade, who was lodged there when he commanded in the North. Near it is the meanest parish <span class="t8">Kirk</span> I ever saw. It is a shame it should be on a high road. After dinner, we passed through a good deal of mountainous country. I had known Mr. Trapaud, the deputy governour of Fort Augustus, twelve years ago, at a circuit at Inverness, where my father was judge. I sent forward one of our guides, and Joseph, with a card to him, that he might know Dr. Johnson and I were coming up, leaving it to him to invite us or not. It was dark when we arrived. The inn was wretched. Government ought to build one, or give the resident governour an additional salary; as in the present state of things, he must necessarily be put to a great expence in entertaining travellers. Joseph announced to us, when we alighted, that the governour waited for us at the gate of the fort. We walked to it. He met us, and with much civility conducted us to his house. It was comfortable to find ourselves in a well-built little square, and a neatly furnished house, in good company, and with a good supper before us; in short, with all the conveniences of civilised life in the midst of rude mountains. Mrs. Trapaud, and the governour&rsquo;s daughter, and her husband, Captain Newmarsh, were all most obliging and polite. The governour had excellent animal spirits, the conversation of a soldier, and somewhat of a Frenchman, to which his extraction entitles him. He is brother to General Cyrus Trapaud. We passed a very agreeable evening.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">TUESDAY, AUGUST 31.</span></p>
<p class="p21">The governour has a very good garden. We looked at it, and at the rest of the fort, which is but small, and may be commanded from a variety of hills around. We also looked at the galley or sloop belonging to the fort, which sails upon the Loch, and brings what is wanted for the garrison. Captains Urie and Darippe, of the 15th regiment of foot, breakfasted with us. They had served in America, and entertained Dr. Johnson much with an account of the Indians. He said, he could make a very pretty book out of them, were he to stay there. Governour Trapaud was much struck with Dr. Johnson. &lsquo;I like to hear him, (said he,) it is so majestick. I should be glad to hear him speak in your court.&rsquo; He pressed us to stay dinner; but I considered that we had a rude road before us, which we could more easily encounter in the morning, and that it was hard to say when we might get up, were we to sit down to good entertainment, in good company: I therefore begged the governour would excuse us. Here too, I had another very pleasing proof how much my father is regarded. The governour expressed the highest respect for him, and bade me tell him, that, if he would come that way on the Northern circuit, he would do him all the honours of the garrison.</p>
<p class="p24">Between twelve and one we set out, and travelled eleven miles, through a wild country, till we came to a house in Glenmorison, called <span class="t8">Anoch</span>, kept by a McQueen. Our landlord was a sensible fellow; he had learned his grammar, and Dr. Johnson justly observed, that &lsquo;a man is the better for that as long as he lives.&rsquo; There were some books here: <span class="t8">a Treatise against Drunkenness</span>, translated from the French; a volume of <span class="t8">The Spectator</span>; a volume of <span class="t8">Prideaux&rsquo;s Connection</span>, and <span class="t8">Cyrus&rsquo;s Travels</span>. McQueen said he had more volumes; and his pride seemed to be much piqued that we were surprised at his having books.</p>
<p class="p24">Near to this place we had passed a party of soldiers, under a serjeant&rsquo;s command, at work upon the road. We gave them two shillings to drink. They came to our inn, and made merry in the barn. We went and paid them a visit, Dr. Johnson saying, &lsquo;Come, let&rsquo;s go and give &rsquo;em another shilling a-piece.&rsquo; We did so; and he was saluted &lsquo;MY LORD&rsquo; by all of them. He is really generous, loves influence, and has the way of gaining it. He said, &lsquo;I am quite feudal, Sir.&rsquo; Here I agree with him. I said, I regretted I was not the head of a clan; however, though not possessed of such an hereditary advantage, I would always endeavour to make my tenants follow me. I could not be a <span class="t8">patriarchal</span> chief, but I would be a <span class="t8">feudal</span> chief.</p>
<p class="p24">The poor soldiers got too much liquor. Some of them fought, and left blood upon the spot, and cursed whiskey next morning. The house here was built of thick turfs, and thatched with thinner turfs and heath. It had three rooms in length, and a little room which projected. Where we sat, the side-walls were <span class="t8">wainscotted</span>, as Dr. Johnson said, with wicker, very neatly plaited. Our landlord had made the whole with his own hands.</p>
<p class="p24">After dinner, McQueen sat by us a while, and talked with us. He said, all the Laird of Glenmorison&rsquo;s people would bleed for him if they were well used; but that seventy men had gone out of the Glen to America. That he himself intended to go next year; for that the rent of his farm, which twenty years ago was only five pounds, was now raised to twenty pounds. That he could pay ten pounds and live; but no more. Dr. Johnson said, he wished M&rsquo;Queen laird of Glenmorison, and the laird to go to America. M&rsquo;Queen very generously answered, he should be sorry for it; for the laird could not shift for himself in America as he could do.</p>
<p class="p24">I talked of the officers whom we had left to-day; how much service they had seen, and how little they got for it, even of fame. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, a soldier gets as little as any man can get.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Goldsmith has acquired more fame than all the officers last war, who were not Generals.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, you will find ten thousand fit to do what they did, before you find one who does what Goldsmith has done. You must consider, that a thing is valued according to its rarity. A pebble that paves the street is in itself more useful than the diamond upon a lady&rsquo;s finger.&rsquo; I wish our friend Goldsmith had heard this.</p>
<p class="p24">I yesterday expressed my wonder that John Hay, one of our guides, who had been pressed aboard a man of war, did not choose to continue in it longer than nine months, after which time he got off. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, no man will be a sailor, who has contrivance enough to get himself into a jail; for, being in a ship is being in a jail, with the chance of being drowned.&rsquo; We had tea in the afternoon, and our landlord&rsquo;s daughter, a modest civil girl, very neatly drest, made it for us. She told us, she had been a year at Inverness, and learnt reading and writing, sewing, knotting, working lace, and pastry. Dr. Johnson made her a present of a book which he had bought at Inverness.</p>
<p class="p24">The room had some deals laid across the joists, as a kind of ceiling. There were two beds in the room, and a woman&rsquo;s gown was hung on a rope to make a curtain of separation between them. Joseph had sheets, which my wife had sent with us, laid on them. We had much hesitation, whether to undress, or lie down with our clothes on. I said at last, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll plunge in! There will be less harbour for vermin about me, when I am stripped!&rsquo; Dr. Johnson said, he was like one hesitating whether to go into the cold bath. At last he resolved too. I observed he might serve a campaign. JOHNSON. &lsquo;I could do all that can be done by patience: whether I should have strength enough, I know not.&rsquo; He was in excellent humour. To see the Rambler as I saw him to-night, was really an amusement. I yesterday told him, I was thinking of writing a poetical letter to him, <span class="t8">on his return from Scotland</span>, in the style of Swift&rsquo;s humorous epistle in the character of Mary Gulliver to her husband, Captain Lemuel Gulliver, on his return to England from the country of the HOUYHNHUMS: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;At early morn I to the market haste,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Studious in ev&rsquo;ry thing to please thy taste.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A curious <span class="t8">fowl</span> and <span class="t8">sparagrass</span> I chose;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(For I remember you were fond of those:)</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three shillings cost the first, the last sev&rsquo;n groats;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sullen you turn from both, and call for OATS:&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He laughed, and asked in whose name I would write it. I said, in Mrs. Thrale&rsquo;s. He was angry. &lsquo;Sir, if you have any sense of decency or delicacy, you won&rsquo;t do that!&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Then let it be in Cole&rsquo;s, the landlord of the <span class="t8">Mitre tavern</span>; where we have so often sat together.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Ay, that may do.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">After we had offered up our private devotions, and had chatted a little from our beds, Dr. Johnson said, &lsquo;GOD bless us both, for Jesus Christ&rsquo;s sake! Good night!&rsquo; I pronounced &lsquo;Amen.&rsquo; He fell asleep immediately. I was not so fortunate for a long time. I fancied myself bit by innumerable vermin under the clothes; and that a spider was travelling from the <span class="t8">wainscot</span> towards my mouth. At last I fell into insensibility.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 1.</span></p>
<p class="p21">I awaked very early. I began to imagine that the landlord, being about to emigrate, might murder us to get our money, and lay it upon the soldiers in the barn. Such groundless fears will arise in the mind, before it has resumed its vigour after sleep! Dr. Johnson had had the same kind of ideas; for he told me afterwards, that he considered so many soldiers, having seen us, would be witnesses, should any harm be done, and that circumstance, I suppose, he considered as a security. When I got up, I found him sound asleep in his miserable <span class="t8">stye</span>, as I may call it, with a coloured handkerchief tied round his head. With difficulty could I awaken him. It reminded me of Henry the Fourth&rsquo;s fine soliloquy on sleep; for there was here as <span class="t8">uneasy a pallet</span> as the poet&rsquo;s imagination could possibly conceive.</p>
<p class="p24">A <span class="t8">red coat</span> of the 15th regiment, whether officer, or only serjeant, I could not be sure, came to the house, in his way to the mountains to shoot deer, which it seems the Laird of Glenmorison does not hinder any body to do. Few, indeed, can do them harm. We had him to breakfast with us. We got away about eight. M&rsquo;Queen walked some miles to give us a convoy. He had, in 1745, joined the Highland army at Fort Augustus, and continued in it till after the battle of Culloden. As he narrated the particulars of that ill-advised, but brave attempt, I could not refrain from tears. There is a certain association of ideas in my mind upon that subject, by which I am strongly affected. The very Highland names, or the sound of a bagpipe, will stir my blood, and fill me with a mixture of melancholy and respect for courage; with pity for an unfortunate and superstitious regard for antiquity, and thoughtless inclination for war; in short, with a crowd of sensations with which sober rationality has nothing to do.</p>
<p class="p24">We passed through Glensheal, with prodigious mountains on each side. We saw where the battle was fought in the year 1719. Dr. Johnson owned he was now in a scene of as wild nature as he could see; but he corrected me sometimes in my inaccurate observations. &lsquo;There, (said I,) is a mountain like a cone.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;No, Sir. It would be called so in a book; and when a man comes to look at it, he sees it is not so. It is indeed pointed at the top; but one side of it is larger than the other.&rsquo; Another mountain I called immense. JOHNSON. &lsquo;No; it is no more than a considerable protuberance.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">We came to a rich green valley, comparatively speaking, and stopped a while to let our horses rest and eat grass. We soon afterwards came to Auchnasheal, a kind of rural village, a number of cottages being built together, as we saw all along in the Highlands. We passed many miles this day without seeing a house, but only little summer-huts, called <span class="t8">shielings</span>. Evan Campbell, servant to Mr. Murchison, factor to the Laird of Macleod in Glenelg, ran along with us to-day. He was a very obliging fellow. At Auchnasheal, we sat down on a green turf seat at the end of a house; they brought us out two wooden dishes of milk, which we tasted. One of them was frothed like a syllabub. I saw a woman preparing it with such a stick as is used for chocolate, and in the same manner. We had a considerable circle about us, men, women, and children, all M&rsquo;Craas, Lord Seaforth&rsquo;s people. Not one of them could speak English. I observed to Dr. Johnson, it was much the same as being with a tribe of Indians. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Yes, Sir; but not so terrifying.&rsquo; I gave all who chose it, snuff and tobacco. Governour Trapaud had made us buy a quantity at Fort Augustus, and put them up in small parcels. I also gave each person a bit of wheat bread, which they had never tasted before. I then gave a penny apiece to each child. I told Dr. Johnson of this; upon which he called to Joseph and our guides, for change for a shilling, and declared that he would distribute among the children. Upon this being announced in Erse, there was a great stir; not only did some children come running down from neighbouring huts, but I observed one black-haired man, who had been with us all along, had gone off, and returned, bringing a very young child. My fellow traveller then ordered the children to be drawn up in a row; and he dealt about his copper, and made them and their parents all happy. The poor M&rsquo;Craas, whatever may be their present state, were of considerable estimation in the year 1715, when there was a line in a song, </p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;And aw the brave M&rsquo;Craas are coming.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">There was great diversity in the faces of the circle around us: some were as black and wild in their appearance as any American savages whatever. One woman was as comely almost as the figure of Sappho, as we see it painted. We asked the old woman, the mistress of the house where we had the milk, (which by the bye, Dr. Johnson told me, for I did not observe it myself, was built not of turf, but of stone,) what we should pay. She said, what we pleased. One of our guides asked her in Erse, if a shilling was enough. She said, &lsquo;yes.&rsquo; But some of the men bade her ask more. This vexed me; because it shewed a desire to impose upon strangers, as they knew that even a shilling was high payment. The woman, however, honestly persisted in her first price; so I gave her half a crown. Thus we had one good scene of life uncommon to us. The people were very much pleased, gave us many blessings, and said they had not had such a day since the old Laird of Macleod&rsquo;s time.</p>
<p class="p24">Dr. Johnson was much refreshed by this repast. He was pleased when I told him he would make a good Chief. He said, &lsquo;Were I a chief, I would dress my servants better than myself, and knock a fellow down if he looked saucy to a Macdonald in rags: but I would not treat men as brutes. I would let them know why all of my clan were to have attention paid to them. I would tell my upper servants why, and make them tell the others.&rsquo; We rode on well, till we came to the high mountain called the Rattakin, by which time both Dr. Johnson and the horses were a good deal fatigued. It is a terrible steep to climb, notwithstanding the road is formed slanting along it; however, we made it out. On the top of it we met Captain M&rsquo;Leod of Balmenoch (a Dutch officer who had come from Sky) riding with his sword slung across him. He asked, &lsquo;Is this Mr. Boswell?&rsquo; which was a proof that we were expected. Going down the hill on the other side was no easy task. As Dr. Johnson was a great weight, the two guides agreed that he should ride the horses alternately. Hay&rsquo;s were the two best, and the Doctor would not ride but upon one or other of them, a black or a brown. But as Hay complained much after ascending the <span class="t8">Rattakin</span>, the Doctor was prevailed with to mount one of Vass&rsquo;s greys. As he rode upon it down hill, it did not go well; and he grumbled. I walked on a little before, but was excessively entertained with the method taken to keep him in good humour. Hay led the horse&rsquo;s head, talking to Dr. Johnson as much as he could; and (having heard him, in the forenoon, express a pastoral pleasure on seeing the goats browzing) just when the Doctor was uttering his displeasure, the fellow cried, with a very Highland accent, &lsquo;See, such pretty goats!&rsquo; Then he whistled, <span class="t8">whu!</span> and made them jump. Little did he conceive what Dr. Johnson was. Here now was a common ignorant Highland clown, imagining that he could divert, as one does a child, &mdash; <span class="t8">Dr. Samuel Johnson!</span> The ludicrousness, absurdity, and extraordinary contrast between what the fellow fancied, and the reality, was truly comick.</p>
<p class="p24">It grew dusky; and we had a very tedious ride for what was called five miles; but I am sure would measure ten. We had no conversation. I was riding forward to the inn at Glenelg, on the shore opposite to Sky, that I might take proper measures, before Dr. Johnson, who was now advancing in dreary silence, Hay leading his horse, should arrive. Vass also walked by the side of his horse, and Joseph followed behind: as therefore he was thus attended, and seemed to be in deep meditation, I thought there could be no harm in leaving him for a little while. He called me back with a tremendous shout, and was really in a passion with me for leaving him. I told him my intentions, but he was not satisfied, and said, &lsquo;Do you know, I should as soon have thought of picking a pocket, as doing so?&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;I am diverted with you, Sir.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, I could never be diverted with incivility. Doing such a thing, makes one lose confidence in him who has done it, as one cannot tell what he may do next.&rsquo; His extraordinary warmth confounded me so much, that I justified myself but lamely to him; yet my intentions were not improper. I wished to get on, to see how we were to be lodged, and how we were to get a boat; all which I thought I could best settle myself, without his having any trouble. To apply his great mind to minute particulars, is wrong: it is like taking an immense balance, such as is kept on quays for weighing cargoes of ships, &mdash; to weigh a guinea. I knew I had neat little scales, which would do better; and that his attention to every thing which falls in his way, and his uncommon desire to be always in the right, would make him weigh, if he knew of the particulars: it was right therefore for me to weigh them, and let him have them only in effect. I however continued to ride by him, finding he wished I should do so.</p>
<p class="p24">As we passed the barracks at Bernéra, I looked at them wishfully, as soldiers have always every thing in the best order: but there was only a serjeant and a few men there. We came on to the inn at Glenelg. There was no provender for our horses; so they were sent to grass, with a man to watch them. A maid shewed us up stairs into a room damp and dirty, with bare walls, a variety of bad smells, a coarse black greasy fir table, and forms of the same kind; and out of a wretched bed started a fellow from his sleep, like Edgar in <span class="t8">King Lear</span>, &lsquo;<span class="t8">Poor Tom&rsquo;s a cold</span>.&rsquo; This inn was furnished with not a single article that we could either eat or drink; but Mr. Murchison, factor to the Laird of Macleod in Glenelg, sent us a bottle of rum and some sugar, with a polite message, to acquaint us, that he was very sorry that he did not hear of us till we had passed his house, otherwise he should have insisted on our sleeping there that night; and that, if he were not obliged to set out for Inverness early next morning, he would have waited upon us. Such extraordinary attention from this gentleman, to entire strangers, deserves the most honourable commemoration.</p>
<p class="p24">Our bad accommodation here made me uneasy, and almost fretful. Dr. Johnson was calm. I said, he was so from vanity. JOHNSON. &lsquo;No, Sir, it is from philosophy.&rsquo; It pleased me to see that the <span class="t8">Rambler</span> could practise so well his own lessons.</p>
<p class="p24">I resumed the subject of my leaving him on the road, and endeavoured to defend it better. He was still violent upon that head, and said, &lsquo;Sir, had you gone on, I was thinking that I should have returned with you to Edinburgh, and then have parted from you, and never spoken to you more.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I sent for fresh hay, with which we made beds for ourselves, each in a room equally miserable. Like Wolfe, we had a &lsquo;choice of difficulties&rsquo;. Dr. Johnson made things easier by comparison. At M&rsquo;Queen&rsquo;s, last night, he observed that few were so well lodged in a ship. To-night he said, we were better than if we had been upon the hill. He lay down buttoned up in his great coat. I had my sheets spread on the hay, and my clothes and great coat laid over me, by way of blankets.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 2.</span></p>
<p class="p21">I had slept ill. Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s anger had affected me much. I considered that, without any bad intention, I might suddenly forfeit his friendship; and was impatient to see him this morning. I told him how uneasy he had made me, by what he had said, and reminded him of his own remark at Aberdeen, upon old friendships being hastily broken off. He owned he had spoken to me in passion; that he would not have done what he threatened; and that, if he had, he should have been ten times worse than I; that forming intimacies, would indeed be &lsquo;limning the water,&rsquo; were they liable to such sudden dissolution; and he added, &lsquo;Let&rsquo;s think no more on&rsquo;t.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Well then, Sir, I shall be easy. Remember, I am to have fair warning in case of any quarrel. You are never to spring a mine upon me. It was absurd in me to believe you.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;You deserved about as much, as to believe me from night to morning.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">After breakfast, we got into a boat for Sky. It rained much when we set off, but cleared up as we advanced. One of the boatmen, who spoke English, said, that a mile at land was two miles at sea. I then observed, that from Glenelg to Armidale in Sky, which was our present course, and is called twelve, was only six miles: but this he could not understand. &lsquo;Well, (said Dr. Johnson,) never talk to me of the native good sense of the Highlanders. Here is a fellow who calls one mile two, and yet cannot comprehend that twelve such imaginary miles make in truth but six.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">We reached the shore of Armidale before one o&rsquo;clock. Sir Alexander M&rsquo;Donald came down to receive us. He and his lady, (formerly Miss Bosville of Yorkshire,) were then in a house built by a tenant at this place, which is in the district of Slate, the family mansion here having been burned in Sir Donald Macdonald&rsquo;s time. The most ancient seat of the chief of the Macdonalds in the isle of Sky was at Duntulm, where there are the remains of a stately castle. The principal residence of the family is now at Mugstot, at which there is a considerable building. Sir Alexander and Lady Macdonald had come to Armidale in their way to Edinburgh, where it was necessary for them to be soon after this time. Armidale is situated on a pretty bay of the narrow sea, which flows between the main land of Scotland and the Isle of Sky. In front there is a grand prospect of the rude mountains of Moidart and Knoidart. Behind are hills gently rising and covered with a finer verdure than I expected to see in this climate, and the scene is enlivened by a number of little clear brooks.</p>
<p class="p24">Sir Alexander Macdonald having been an Eton scholar, and being a gentleman of talents, Dr. Johnson had been very well pleased with him in London. But my fellow-traveller and I were now full of the old Highland spirit, and were dissatisfied at hearing of racked rents and emigration, and finding a chief not surrounded by his clan. Dr. Johnson said, &lsquo;Sir, the Highland chiefs should not be allowed to go farther south than Aberdeen. A strong-minded man, like Sir James Macdonald, may be improved by an English education; but in general, they will be tamed into insignificance.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">We found here Mr. Janes of Aberdeenshire, a naturalist. Janes said he had been at Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s in London, with Ferguson the astronomer. JOHNSON. &lsquo;It is strange that, in such distant places, I should meet with any one who knows me. I should have thought I might hide myself in Sky.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 3.</span></p>
<p class="p21">This day proving wet, we should have passed our time very uncomfortably, had we not found in the house two chests of books, which we eagerly ransacked. After dinner, when I alone was left at table with the few Highland gentlemen who were of the company, having talked with very high respect of Sir James Macdonald, they were all so much affected as to shed tears. One of them was Mr. Donald Macdonald, who had been lieutenant of grenadiers in the Highland regiment, raised by Colonel Montgomery, now Earl of Eglintoune, in the war before last; one of those regiments which the late Lord Chatham prided himself in having brought from &lsquo;the mountains of the North:&rsquo; by doing which he contributed to extinguish in the Highlands the remains of disaffection to the present Royal Family. From this gentleman&rsquo;s conversation, I first learnt how very popular his Colonel was among the Highlanders; of which I had such continued proofs, during the whole course of my Tour, that on my return I could not help telling the noble Earl himself, that I did not before know how great a man he was.</p>
<p class="p24">We were advised by some persons here to visit Rasay, in our way to Dunvegan, the seat of the Laird of Macleod. Being informed that the Rev. Mr. Donald M&rsquo;Queen was the most intelligent man in Sky, and having been favoured with a letter of introduction to him, by the learned Sir James Foulis, I sent it to him by an express, and requested he would meet us at Rasay; and at the same time enclosed a letter to the Laird of Macleod, informing him that we intended in a few days to have the honour of waiting on him at Dunvegan.</p>
<p class="p24">Dr. Johnson this day endeavoured to obtain some knowledge of the state of the country; but complained that he could get no distinct information about any thing, from those with whom he conversed.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 4.</span></p>
<p class="p21">My endeavours to rouse the English-bred Chieftain, in whose house we were, to the feudal and patriarchal feelings, proving ineffectual, Dr. Johnson this morning tried to bring him to our way of thinking. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Were I in your place, Sir, in seven years I would make this an independant island. I would roast oxen whole, and hang out a flag as a signal to the Macdonalds to come and get beef and whiskey.&rsquo; Sir Alexander was still starting difficulties. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Nay, Sir; if you are born to object, I have done with you. Sir, I would have a magazine of arms.&rsquo; SIR ALEXANDER. &lsquo;They would rust.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Let there be men to keep them clean. Your ancestors did not use to let their arms rust.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">We attempted in vain to communicate to him a portion of our enthusiasm. He bore with so polite a good nature our warm, and what some might call Gothick, expostulations, on this subject, that I should not forgive myself, were I to record all that Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s ardour led him to say. &mdash; This day was little better than a blank.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">SUNDAY, SEPTEMBER 5.</span></p>
<p class="p21">I walked to the parish church of Slate, which is a very poor one. There are no church bells in the island. I was told there were once some; what has become of them, I could not learn. The minister not being at home, there was no service. I went into the church, and saw the monument of Sir James Macdonald, which was elegantly executed at Rome, and has the following inscription, written by his friend, George Lord Lyttelton: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the memory</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of SIR JAMES MACDONALD, BART.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who in the flower of youth</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had attained to so eminent a degree of knowledge,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Mathematics, Philosophy, Languages,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in every other branch of useful and polite learning</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As few have acquired in a long life</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wholly devoted to study:</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet to this erudition he joined</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What can rarely be found with it,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great talents for business,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great propriety of behaviour,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great politeness of manners!</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His eloquence was sweet, correct, and flowing;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His memory vast and exact;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His judgement strong and acute;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All which endowments, united</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the most amiable temper</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And every private virtue,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Procured him, not only in his own country,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But also from foreign nations,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The highest marks of esteem.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the year of our Lord 1766,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 25th of his life,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a long and extremely painful illness,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which he supported with admirable patience and fortitude,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He died at Rome,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where, notwithstanding the difference of religion,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such extraordinary honours were paid to his memory,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As had never graced that of any other British Subject,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the death of Sir Philip Sidney.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fame he left behind him is the best consolation</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To his afflicted family,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And to his countrymen in this isle,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For whose benefit he had planned</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many useful improvements,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which his fruitful genius suggested,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And his active spirit promoted,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the sober direction</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of a clear and enlightened understanding.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reader, bewail our loss,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that of all Britain.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In testimony of her love,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as the best return she can make</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To her departed son,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the constant tenderness and affection</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which, even to his last moments,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He shewed for her,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His much afflicted mother,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The LADY MARGARET MACDONALD,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daughter to the EARL of EGLINTOUNE,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Erected this Monument,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A.D. 1768&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Dr. Johnson said, the inscription should have been in Latin, as every thing intended to be universal and permanent should be.</p>
<p class="p24">This being a beautiful day, my spirits were cheered by the mere effect of climate. I had felt a return of spleen during my stay at Armidale, and had it not been that I had Dr. Johnson to contemplate, I should have sunk into dejection; but his firmness supported me. I looked at him, as a man whose head is turning giddy at sea looks at a rock, or any fixed object. I wondered at his tranquillity. He said, &lsquo;Sir, when a man retires into an island, he is to turn his thoughts entirely to another world. He has done with this.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;It appears to me, Sir, to be very difficult to unite a due attention to this world, and that which is to come; for, if we engage eagerly in the affairs of life, we are apt to be totally forgetful of a future state; and, on the other hand, a steady contemplation of the awful concerns of eternity renders all objects here so insignificant, as to make us indifferent and negligent about them.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, Dr. Cheyne has laid down a rule to himself on this subject, which should be imprinted on every mind:&mdash; &ldquo;<span class="t8">To neglect nothing to secure my eternal peace, more than if I had been certified I should die within the day: nor to mind any thing that my secular obligations and duties demanded of me, less than if I had been ensured to live fifty years more</span>.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I must here observe, that though Dr. Johnson appeared now to be philosophically calm, yet his genius did not shine forth as in companies, where I have listened to him with admiration. The vigour of his mind was, however, sufficiently manifested, by his discovering no symptoms of feeble relaxation in the dull, &lsquo;weary, flat and unprofitable&rsquo; state in which we now were placed.</p>
<p class="p24">I am inclined to think that it was on this day he composed the following Ode upon the <span class="t8">Isle of Sky</span>, which a few days afterwards he shewed me at Rasay: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ODA,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ponti profundis clausa recessibus,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strepens procellis, rupibus obsita,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quam grata defesso virentem</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Skia sinum nebulosa pandis.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His cura, credo, sedibus exulat;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His blanda certe pax habitat locis:</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Non ira, non moeror quietis</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Insidias meditatur horis.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At non cavata rupe latescere,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Menti nec aegrae montibus aviis</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prodest vagari, nec frementes</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;E scopulo numerare fluctus.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Humana virtus non sibi sufficit,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Datur nec aequum cuique animum sibi</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parare posse, ut Stoicorum</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secta crepet nimis alta fallax.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exaestuantis pectoris impetum,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rex summe, solus tu regis arbiter,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mentisque, te tollente, surgunt,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Te recidunt moderante fluctus.</p>
<p class="p24">After supper, Dr. Johnson told us, that Isaac Hawkins Browne drank freely for thirty years, and that he wrote his poem, <span class="t8">De Animi Immortalitate</span>, in some of the last of these years. I listened to this with the eagerness of one who, conscious of being himself fond of wine, is glad to hear that a man of so much genius and good thinking as Browne had the same propensity.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 6.</span></p>
<p class="p21">We set out, accompanied by Mr. Donald M&rsquo;Leod, (late of Canna) as our guide. We rode for some time along the district of Slate, near the shore. The houses in general are made of turf, covered with grass. The country seemed well peopled. We came into the district of Strath, and passed along a wild moorish tract of land till we arrived at the shore. There we found good verdure, and some curious whin-rocks, or collections of stones like the ruins of the foundations of old buildings. We saw also three Cairns of considerable size.</p>
<p class="p24">About a mile beyond Broadfoot, is Corrichatachin, a farm of Sir Alexander Macdonald&rsquo;s, possessed by Mr. M&rsquo;Kinnon, who received us with a hearty welcome, as did his wife, who was what we call in Scotland a <span class="t8">lady-like</span> woman. Mr. Pennant in the course of his tour to the Hebrides, passed two nights at this gentleman&rsquo;s house. On its being mentioned, that a present had here been made to him of a curious specimen of Highland antiquity, Dr. Johnson said, &lsquo;Sir, it was more than he deserved; the dog is a Whig.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">We here enjoyed the comfort of a table plentifully furnished, the satisfaction of which was heightened by a numerous and cheerful company; and we for the first time had a specimen of the joyous social manners of the inhabitants of the Highlands. They talked in their own ancient language, with fluent vivacity, and sung many Erse songs with such spirit, that, though Dr. Johnson was treated with the greatest respect and attention, there were moments in which he seemed to be forgotten. For myself, though but a <span class="t8">Lowlander</span>, having picked up a few words of the language, I presumed to mingle in their mirth, and joined in the choruses with as much glee as any of the company. Dr. Johnson being fatigued with his journey, retired early to his chamber, where he composed the following Ode, addressed to Mrs. Thrale: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ODA.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Permeo terras, ubi nuda rupes</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saxeas miscet nebulis ruinas,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Torva ubi rident steriles coloni</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rura labores.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pervagor gentes, hominum ferorum</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vita ubi nullo decorata cultu</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Squallet informis, tugurique fumis</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Foeda latescit.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inter erroris salebrosa longi,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inter ignotae strepitus loquelae,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quot modis mecum, quid agat, requiro,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thralia dulcis?</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seu viri curas pia nupta mulcet,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seu fovet mater sobolem benigna,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sive cum libris novitate pascet</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sedula mentem;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sit memor nostri, fideique merces,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stet fides constans, meritoque blandum</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thraliae discant resonare nomen</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Littora Skiae.</p>
<p class="p24">Scriptum in Skiá, Sept. 6, 1773.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 7.</span></p>
<p class="p21">Dr. Johnson was much pleased with his entertainment here. There were many good books in the house: <span class="t8">Hector Boethius</span> in Latin; Cave&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Lives of the Fathers</span>; Baker&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Chronicle</span>; Jeremy Collier&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Church History</span>; Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s small <span class="t8">Dictionary</span>; Craufurd&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Officers of State</span>, and several more: &mdash; a mezzotinto of Mrs. Brooks the actress (by some strange chance in Sky), and also a print of Macdonald of Clanranald, with a Latin inscription about the cruelties after the battle of Culloden, which will never be forgotten.</p>
<p class="p24">It was a very wet stormy day; we were therefore obliged to remain here, it being impossible to cross the sea to Rasay.</p>
<p class="p24">I employed a part of the forenoon in writing this Journal. The rest of it was somewhat dreary, from the gloominess of the weather, and the uncertain state which we were in, as we could not tell but it might clear up every hour. Nothing is more painful to the mind than a state of suspence, especially when it depends upon the weather, concerning which there can be so little calculation. As Dr. Johnson said of our weariness on the Monday at Aberdeen, &lsquo;Sensation is sensation:&rsquo; Corrichatachin, which was last night a hospitable house, was, in my mind, changed to-day into a prison. After dinner I read some of Dr. Macpherson&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Dissertations on the Ancient Caledonians</span>. I was disgusted by the unsatisfactory conjectures as to antiquity, before the days of record. I was happy when tea came. Such, I take it, is the state of those who live in the country. Meals are wished for from the cravings of vacuity of mind, as well as from the desire of eating. I was hurt to find even such a temporary feebleness, and that I was so far from being that robust wise man who is sufficient for his own happiness. I felt a kind of lethargy of indolence. I did not exert myself to get Dr. Johnson to talk, that I might not have the labour of writing down his conversation. He enquired here if there were any remains of the second sight. Mr. M&rsquo;Pherson, Minister of Slate, said, he was <span class="t8">resolved</span> not to believe it, because it was founded on no principle. JOHNSON. &lsquo;There are many things then, which we are sure are true, that you will not believe. What principle is there, why a loadstone attracts iron? why an egg produces a chicken by heat? why a tree grows upwards, when the natural tendency of all things is downwards? Sir, it depends upon the degree of evidence that you have.&rsquo; Young Mr. M&rsquo;Kinnon mentioned one M&rsquo;Kenzie, who is still alive, who had often fainted in his presence, and when he recovered, mentioned visions which had been presented to him. He told Mr. M&rsquo;Kinnon, that at such a place he should meet a funeral, and that such and such people would be the bearers, naming four; and three weeks afterwards he saw what M&rsquo;Kenzie had predicted. The naming the very spot in a country where a funeral comes a long way, and the very people as bearers, when there are so many out of whom a choice may be made, seems extraordinary. We should have sent for M&rsquo;Kenzie, had we not been informed that he could speak no English. Besides, the facts were not related with sufficient accuracy.</p>
<p class="p24">Mrs. M&rsquo;Kinnon, who is a daughter of old Kingsburgh, told us that her father was one day riding in Sky, and some women, who were at work in a field on the side of the road, said to him they had heard two <span class="t8">taiscks</span>, (that is, two voices of persons about to die,) and what was remarkable, one of them was an <span class="t8">English taisck</span>, which they never heard before. When he returned, he at that very place met two funerals, and one of them was that of a woman who had come from the main land, and could speak only English. This, she remarked, made a great impression upon her father.</p>
<p class="p24">How all the people here were lodged, I know not. It was partly done by separating man and wife, and putting a number of men in one room, and of women in another.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 8.</span></p>
<p class="p21">When I waked, the rain was much heavier than yesterday; but the wind had abated. By breakfast, the day was better, and in a little while it was calm and clear. I felt my spirits much elated. The propriety of the expression, &lsquo;<span class="t8">the sunshine of the breast</span>,&rsquo; now struck me with peculiar force; for the brilliant rays penetrated into my very soul. We were all in better humour than before. Mrs. M&rsquo;Kinnon, with unaffected hospitality and politeness, expressed her happiness in having such company in her house, and appeared to understand and relish Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s conversation, as indeed all the company seemed to do. When I knew she was old Kingsburgh&rsquo;s daughter, I did not wonder at the good appearance which she made.</p>
<p class="p24">She talked as if her husband and family would emigrate, rather than be oppressed by their landlord; and said, &lsquo;how agreeable would it be, if these gentlemen should come in upon us when we are in America.&rsquo; Somebody observed that Sir Alexander Macdonald was always frightened at sea. JOHNSON. &lsquo;<span class="t8">He</span> is frightened at sea; and his tenants are frightened when he comes to land.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">We resolved to set out directly after breakfast. We had about two miles to ride to the sea-side, and there we expected to get one of the boats belonging to the fleet of bounty herring-busses then on the coast, or at least a good country fishing-boat. But while we were preparing to set out, there arrived a man with the following card from the Reverend Mr. Donald M&rsquo;Queen: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Mr. M&rsquo;Queen&rsquo;s compliments to Mr. Boswell, and begs leave to acquaint him that, fearing the want of a proper boat, as much as the rain of yesterday, might have caused a stop, he is now at Skianwden with Macgillichallum&rsquo;s carriage, to convey him and Dr. Johnson to Rasay, where they will meet with a most hearty welcome, and where. Macleod, being on a visit, now attends their motions.&rsquo; &lsquo;Wednesday afternoon.&rsquo;</p>
