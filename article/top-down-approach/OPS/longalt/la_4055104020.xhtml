Each router is associated with two hosts, and each host has its own IP address. </p><p id="P700101195200000000000000000A8D1" data-uri="M04_KURO4140_07_SE_C04.xhtml#P700101195200000000000000000A8D1">At R1, the first host has an IP address of 223.1.1.1 and the second host has an IP address of 223.1.1.4. These hosts connect to a cloud and the cloud connects to the router. The connection has its own IP address, which is 223.1.1.3.</p><p id="P700101195200000000000000000A8D2" data-uri="M04_KURO4140_07_SE_C04.xhtml#P700101195200000000000000000A8D2">At R2, the first host has an IP address of 223.1.2.1 and the second host has an IP address of 223.1.2.2. These hosts connect to a cloud and the cloud connects to the router. This connection has its own IP address, which is 223.1.2.6.</p><p id="P700101195200000000000000000A8D3" data-uri="M04_KURO4140_07_SE_C04.xhtml#P700101195200000000000000000A8D3">At R3, the first host as an IP address of 223.1.3.1 and the second host has an IP address of 223.1.3.2. These hosts connect to a cloud and the cloud connects to the router. The connection has its own IP address, which is 223.1.3.27.</p><p id="P700101195200000000000000000A8D4" data-uri="M04_KURO4140_07_SE_C04.xhtml#P700101195200000000000000000A8D4">Each router also includes an IP address at each point where it connects to another router. Where R1 connects to R2, R1 has an IP address of 223.1.9.2 and R2 has an IP address of 223.1.9.1. Where R2 connects to R3, R2 has an IP address of 223.1.8.1 and R3 has an IP address of 223.1.8.0. Where R3 connects to R1, R3 has an IP address of 223.1.7.1 and R1 has an IP address of 223.1.7.0.</p></div></section></body></html>
