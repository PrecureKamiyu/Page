<p class="p24">Nothing could be more fortunate for Johnson than this connection. He had at Mr. Thrale&rsquo;s all the comforts and even luxuries of life; his melancholy was diverted, and his irregular habits lessened by association with an agreeable and well-ordered family. He was treated with the utmost respect, and even affection. The vivacity of Mrs. Thrale&rsquo;s literary talk roused him to cheerfulness and exertion, even when they were alone. But this was not often the case; for he found here a constant succession of what gave him the highest enjoyment: the society of the learned, the witty, and the eminent in every way, who were assembled in numerous companies, called forth his wonderful powers, and gratified him with admiration, to which no man could be insensible.</p>
<p class="p24">In the October of this year he at length gave to the world his edition of <span class="t8">Shakspeare</span>, which, if it had no other merit but that of producing his Preface, in which the excellencies and defects of that immortal bard are displayed with a masterly hand, the nation would have had no reason to complain. A blind indiscriminate admiration of Shakspeare had exposed the British nation to the ridicule of foreigners. Johnson, by candidly admitting the faults of his poet, had the more credit in bestowing on him deserved and indisputable praise; and doubtless none of all his panegyrists have done him half so much honour. Their praise was, like that of a counsel, upon his own side of the cause: Johnson&rsquo;s was like the grave, well-considered, and impartial opinion of the judge, which falls from his lips with weight, and is received with reverence. What he did as a commentator has no small share of merit, though his researches were not so ample, and his investigations so acute as they might have been, which we now certainly know from the labours of other able and ingenious criticks who have followed him. He has enriched his edition with a concise account of each play, and of its characteristick excellence. Many of his notes have illustrated obscurities in the text, and placed passages eminent for beauty in a more conspicuous light; and he has in general exhibited such a mode of annotation, as may be beneficial to all subsequent editors.</p>
<p class="p24">His <span class="t8">Shakespeare</span> was virulently attacked by Mr. William Kenrick, who obtained the degree of LL.D. from a Scotch University, and wrote for the booksellers in a great variety of branches. Though he certainly was not without considerable merit, he wrote with so little regard to decency and principles, and decorum, and in so hasty a manner, that his reputation was neither extensive nor lasting. I remember one evening, when some of his works were mentioned, Dr. Goldsmith said, he had never heard of them; upon which Dr. Johnson observed, &lsquo;Sir, he is one of the many who have made themselves <span class="t8">publick</span>, without making themselves <span class="t8">known</span>.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">A young student of Oxford, of the name of Barclay, wrote an answer to Kenrick&rsquo;s review of Johnson&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Shakspeare</span>. Johnson was at first angry that Kenrick&rsquo;s attack should have the credit of an answer. But afterwards, considering the young man&rsquo;s good intention, he kindly noticed him, and probably would have done more, had not the young man died.</p>
<p class="p24">In his Preface to <span class="t8">Shakspeare</span>, Johnson treated Voltaire very contemptuously, observing, upon some of his remarks, &lsquo;These are the petty criticisms of petty wits.&rsquo; Voltaire, in revenge, made an attack upon Johnson, in one of his numerous literary sallies, which I remember to have read; but there being no general index to his voluminous works, have searched in vain, and therefore cannot quote it.</p>
<p class="p24">Voltaire was an antagonist with whom I thought Johnson should not disdain to contend. I pressed him to answer. He said, he perhaps might; but he never did.</p>
<p class="p24">Mr. Burney having occasion to write to Johnson for some receipts for subscriptions to his Shakspeare, which Johnson had omitted to deliver when the money was paid, he availed himself of that opportunity of thanking Johnson for the great pleasure which he had received from the perusal of his Preface to <span class="t8">Shakspeare</span>; which, although it excited much clamour against him at first, is now justly ranked among the most excellent of his writings. To this letter Johnson returned the following answer: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To CHARLES BURNEY ESQ. IN POLAND-STREET.</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am sorry that your kindness to me has brought upon you so much trouble, though you have taken care to abate that sorrow, by the pleasure which I receive from your approbation. I defend my criticism in the same manner with you. We must confess the faults of our favourite, to gain credit to our praise of his excellencies. He that claims, either in himself or for another, the honours of perfection, will surely injure the reputation which he designs to assist.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Be pleased to make my compliments to your family.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am, Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your most obliged</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;And most humble servant,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Sam. Johnson.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Oct. 16, 1765.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">From one of his journals I transcribed what follows:</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;At church, Oct. &mdash; 65.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To avoid all singularity; <span class="t8">Bonaventura</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To come in before service, and compose my mind by meditation, or by reading some portions of scriptures. <span class="t8">Tetty</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;If I can hear the sermon, to attend it, unless attention be more troublesome than useful.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To consider the act of prayer as a reposal of myself upon God, and a resignation of &lsquo;all into his holy hand.&rsquo;</p>
