Database systems designed for multiuser systems need to support the full set of transaction features.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 107pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Such systems are usually designed as servers that accept requests from applications via <span class="s44">SQL </span>or their own <span class="s44">API</span>s.</p><p class="s39" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 107pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: justify;">• <span class="s40">Parallelism with a small number of cores is referred to as coarse-grained paral- lelism. Parallelism with a large number of processors is referred to as ﬁne-grained parallelism.</span></p><p class="s39" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 107pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: justify;">• <span class="s40">Transaction servers have multiple processes, possibly running on multiple proces- sors. So that these processes have access to common data, such as the database buﬀer, systems store such data in shared memory. In addition to processes that handle queries, there are system processes that carry out tasks such as lock and log management and checkpointing.</span></p><p class="s39" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 107pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: justify;">• <span class="s40">Access to shared memory is controlled by a mutual-exclusion mechanism based on machine-level atomic instructions (test-and-set or compare-and-swap).</span></p><p class="s39" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 107pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: justify;">• <span class="s40">Data-server systems supply raw data to clients. Such systems strive to minimize communication between clients and servers by caching data and locks at the clients. Parallel database systems use similar optimizations.</span></p><p class="s39" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 107pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: justify;">• <span class="s40">Parallel database systems consist of multiple processors and multiple disks con- nected by a fast interconnection network. Speedup measures how much we can in- crease processing speed by increasing parallelism for a single transaction. Scaleup measures how well we can handle an increased number of transactions by increas- ing parallelism. Interference, skew, and start-up costs act as barriers to getting ideal speedup and scaleup.</span></p><p class="s39" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 107pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: justify;">• <span class="s40">The components of a parallel system are connected via several possible types of interconnection networks: bus, ring, mesh, hypercube, or a tree-like topology.</span></p><p class="s39" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 107pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: justify;">• <span class="s40">Parallel database architectures include the shared-memory, shared-disk, shared- nothing, and hierarchical architectures. These architectures have diﬀerent trade- oﬀs of scalability versus communication speed.</span></p><p class="s40" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 107pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s39">• </span>Modern shared-memory architectures associate some memory with each proces- sor, resulting in a non-uniform memory architecture (<span class="s41">NUMA</span>). Since each proces- sor has its own cache, there is a problem of ensuring cache coherency, that is, consistency of data across the caches of multiple processors.</p><p class="s39" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 107pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: justify;">• <span class="s40">Storage-area networks are a special type of local-area network designed to provide fast interconnection between large banks of storage devices and multiple comput- ers.</span></p><p class="s39" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 107pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: justify;">• <span class="s40">A distributed database system is a collection of partially independent database sys- tems that (ideally) share a common schema and coordinate processing of transac- tions that access nonlocal data.</span></p><p class="s64" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 119pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;">Review Terms  <span class="s164">997</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s39" style="padding-left: 139pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: justify;">• <span class="s40">Cloud services may be provided at a variety of levels: The infrastructure-as-a- service model provides clients with a virtual machine on which clients install their own software. The platform-as-a-service model provides data-storage, database, and application servers in addition to virtual machines, but the client needs to in- stall and maintain application software. The software-as-a-service model provides that application software plus the underlying platform.</span></p><p class="s39" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 139pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: justify;">• <span class="s40">Organizations using cloud services have to consider a wide variety of technical, economic, and legal issues in order to ensure the privacy and security of data and adequate performance despite the likelihood of data being stored at a remote location.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part375.htm">&lt; 上一个</a><span> | </span><a href="../database.html">内容</a><span> | </span><a href="part377.htm">下一个 &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
