How might you go about doing this? You might first consider using a vacuous transport protocol. In particular, on the sending side, you might consider taking the messages from the application process and passing them directly to the network layer; and on the receiving side, you might consider taking the messages arriving from the network layer and passing them directly to the application process. But as we learned in the previous section, we have <span class="pagebreak" title="201" id="P70010119520000000000000000011C4" data-uri="M03_KURO4140_07_SE_C03.xhtml#P70010119520000000000000000011C4" epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>to do a little more than nothing! At the very least, the transport layer has to provide a multiplexing/demultiplexing service in order to pass data between the network layer and the correct application-level process.</p>
<p id="P700101195200000000000000000A140" data-uri="M03_KURO4140_07_SE_C03.xhtml#P700101195200000000000000000A140">UDP, defined in <a class="biblioref" href="fileP70010119520000000000000000037E0.xhtml#P7001011952000000000000000003ADA" data-foobar="7">[RFC 768]</a>, does just about as little as a transport protocol can do. Aside from the multiplexing/demultiplexing function and some light error checking, it adds nothing to IP. In fact, if the application developer chooses UDP instead of TCP, then the application is almost directly talking with IP. UDP takes messages from the application process, attaches source and destination port number fields for the multiplexing/demultiplexing service, adds two other small fields, and passes the resulting segment to the network layer. The network layer encapsulates the transport-layer segment into an IP datagram and then makes a best-effort attempt to deliver the segment to the receiving host. If the segment arrives at the receiving host, UDP uses the destination port number to deliver the segment’s data to the correct application process. Note that with UDP there is no handshaking between sending and receiving transport-layer entities before sending a segment. For this reason, UDP is said to be <i>connectionless.</i></p>
<p id="P700101195200000000000000000A141" data-uri="M03_KURO4140_07_SE_C03.xhtml#P700101195200000000000000000A141">DNS is an example of an application-layer protocol that typically uses UDP. When the DNS application in a host wants to make a query, it constructs a DNS query message and passes the message to UDP. Without performing any handshaking with the UDP entity running on the destination end system, the host-side UDP adds header fields to the message and passes the resulting segment to the network layer. The network layer encapsulates the UDP segment into a datagram and sends the datagram to a name server. The DNS application at the querying host then waits for a reply to its query. If it doesn’t receive a reply (possibly because the underlying network lost the query or the reply), it might try resending the query, try sending the query to another name server, or inform the invoking application that it can’t get a reply.</p>

Isn’t TCP always preferable, since TCP provides a reliable data transfer service, while UDP does not? The answer is no, as some applications are better suited for UDP for the following reasons:</p>
<ul id="P700101195200000000000000000A143" data-uri="M03_KURO4140_07_SE_C03.xhtml#P700101195200000000000000000A143">

TCP, on the other hand, has a congestion-control mechanism that throttles the transport-layer TCP sender when one or more links between the source and destination hosts become excessively congested. TCP will also continue to resend a segment until the receipt of the segment has been acknowledged by the destination, regardless of how long reliable delivery takes. Since real-time applications often require a minimum sending rate, do not want to overly delay segment transmission, and can tolerate some data loss, TCP’s service model is not particularly well matched to these applications’ needs. As discussed below, these applications can use UDP and implement, as part of the application, any additional functionality that is needed beyond UDP’s no-frills segment-delivery service.</p></li>

UDP just blasts away without any formal preliminaries. Thus UDP does not introduce any delay to establish a connection. This is probably the principal reason why DNS runs over UDP rather than TCP—DNS would be much slower if it ran over TCP. HTTP uses TCP rather than UDP, since reliability is critical for Web pages with text. But, as we briefly discussed in <a class="xref" href="fileP7001011952000000000000000000A27.xhtml#P7001011952000000000000000000A27" data-foobar="7"><span class="label">Section</span> <span class="number">2.2</span></a>, the TCP connection-establishment delay in HTTP is an important contributor to the delays associated with downloading Web documents. Indeed, the QUIC protocol (Quick UDP Internet Connection, <a class="biblioref" href="fileP70010119520000000000000000037E0.xhtml#P70010119520000000000000000039AE" data-foobar="7">[Iyengar 2015]</a>), used in Google’s Chrome browser, uses UDP as its underlying transport protocol and implements reliability in an application-layer protocol on top of UDP.</p></li>

This connection state includes receive and send buffers, congestion-control parameters, and sequence and acknowledgment number parameters. We will see in <a class="xref" href="fileP7001011952000000000000000001442.xhtml#P7001011952000000000000000001442" data-foobar="7"><span class="label">Section</span> <span class="number">3.5</span></a> that this state information is needed to implement TCP’s reliable data transfer service and to provide congestion control. UDP, on the other hand, does not maintain connection state and does not track any of these parameters. For this reason, a server devoted to a particular application can typically support many more active clients when the application runs over UDP rather than TCP.</p></li>

As we expect, e-mail, remote terminal access, the Web, and file transfer run over TCP—all these applications need the reliable data transfer service of TCP. Nevertheless, many important applications run over UDP rather than TCP. For example, UDP is used to carry network management (SNMP; see <a class="xref" href="fileP7001011952000000000000000002202.xhtml#P7001011952000000000000000002202" data-foobar="7"><span class="label">Section</span> <span class="number">5.7</span></a>) data. UDP is preferred to TCP in this case, since network management applications must often run when the network is in a stressed state—precisely when reliable, congestion-controlled data transfer is difficult to achieve. Also, as we mentioned earlier, DNS runs over UDP, thereby avoiding TCP’s connection-establishment delays.</p>

As we mentioned above, UDP has no congestion control. But congestion control is needed to prevent the network from entering a congested state in which very little useful work is done. If everyone were to start streaming high-bit-rate video without using any congestion control, there would be so much packet overflow at routers that very few UDP packets would successfully traverse the source-to-destination path. Moreover, the high loss rates induced by the uncontrolled UDP senders would cause the TCP senders (which, as we’ll see, <i>do</i> decrease their sending rates in the face of congestion) to dramatically decrease their rates. Thus, the lack of congestion control in UDP can result in high loss rates between a UDP sender and receiver, and the crowding out of TCP sessions—a potentially serious problem <a class="biblioref" href="fileP70010119520000000000000000037E0.xhtml#P7001011952000000000000000003900" data-foobar="7">[Floyd 1999]</a>.

The application data occupies the data field of the UDP segment. For example, for DNS, the data field contains either a query message or a response message. For a streaming audio application, audio samples fill the data field. The UDP header has only four fields, each consisting of two bytes. As discussed in the previous section, the port numbers allow the destination host to pass the application data to the correct process running on the destination end system (that is, to perform the demultiplexing function). The length field specifies the number of bytes in the UDP segment (header plus data). An explicit length value is needed since the size of the data field may differ from one UDP segment to the next. The checksum is used by the receiving host to check whether errors have been introduced into the segment. In truth, the checksum is also calculated over a few of the fields in the IP header in addition to the UDP segment. But we ignore this detail in order to see the forest through the trees.

The 1s complement is obtained by converting all the 0s to 1s and converting all the 1s to 0s. Thus the 1s complement of the sum 0100101011000010 is 1011010100111101, which becomes the checksum. At the receiver, all four 16-bit words are added, including the checksum. If no errors are introduced into the packet, then clearly the sum at the receiver will be 1111111111111111. If one of the bits is a 0, then we know that errors have been introduced into the packet.</p>

The reason is that there is no guarantee that all the links between source and destination provide error checking; that is, one of the links may use a link-layer protocol that does not provide error checking. Furthermore, even if segments are correctly transferred across a link, it’s possible that bit errors could be introduced when a segment is stored in a router’s memory. Given that neither link-by-link reliability nor in-memory error detection is guaranteed, UDP must provide error detection at the transport layer, <i>on an end-end basis</i>, if the end-end data transfer service is to provide error detection. This is an example of the celebrated <span class="keyword" id="P7001011952000000000000000001209" data-uri="M03_KURO4140_07_SE_C03.xhtml#P7001011952000000000000000001209"><b>end-end principle</b></span> in system design <a class="biblioref" href="fileP70010119520000000000000000037E0.xhtml#P7001011952000000000000000003BE2" data-foobar="7">[Saltzer 1984]</a>, which states that since certain functionality (error detection, in this case) must be implemented on an end-end basis: “functions placed <span class="pagebreak" title="206" id="P700101195200000000000000000120A" data-uri="M03_KURO4140_07_SE_C03.xhtml#P700101195200000000000000000120A" epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>at the lower levels may be redundant or of little value when compared to the cost of providing them at the higher level.”</p>

Although UDP provides error checking, it does not do anything to recover from an error. Some implementations of UDP simply discard the damaged segment; others pass the damaged segment to the application with a warning.</p>
<p id="P700101195200000000000000000A17C" data-uri="M03_KURO4140_07_SE_C03.xhtml#P700101195200000000000000000A17C">That wraps up our discussion of UDP. We will soon see that TCP offers reliable data transfer to its applications as well as other services that UDP doesn’t offer. Naturally, TCP is also more complex than UDP. Before discussing TCP, however, it will be useful to step back and first discuss the underlying principles of reliable data transfer.</p>
