<body>
<h2 class="h20"><a id="a1812"></a><a id="a1813"></a>TIMON OF ATHENS</h2>
<p class="p21">I.i.3 (271,3)</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Poet</span>. Ay, that&rsquo;s well known:</p>
<p class="p24">But what particular rarity! what strange,</p>
<p class="p24">Which manifold record not matches? See,</p>
<p class="p24">Magick of bounty!]</p>
<p class="p24">The learned commentator&rsquo;s [Warburton&rsquo;s] note must shift for itself. I cannot but think that this passage is at present in confusion. The poet asks a question, and stays not for an answer, nor has his question any apparent drift or consequence. I would range the passage thus:</p>
<p class="p24">Poet. <span class="t8">Ay, that&rsquo;s well known.</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Bat what particular rarity? what so strange,</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">That manifold record not matches?</span></p>
<p class="p24">Pain. <span class="t8">See!</span></p>
<p class="p24">Poet. <span class="t8">Magick of &mdash; bounty, &amp;c.</span></p>
<p class="p24">It may not be improperly observed here, that as there is only one copy of this play, no help can be had from collation, and more liberty must be allowed to conjecture.</p>
<p class="p24">I.i.10 (272,4) breath&rsquo;d as it were/To an untirable and continuate goodness] <span class="t8">Breathed</span> is <span class="t8">inured by constant practice</span>; so trained as not to be wearied. To <span class="t8">breathe</span> a horse, is to exercise him for the course.</p>
<p class="p24">I.i.20 (273,8) <span class="t8">Poet</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">A thing slipt idly from me.</p>
<p class="p24">Our poesy is as a gum, which oozes</p>
<p class="p24">From whence &rsquo;tis nourished. The fire i&rsquo; the flint</p>
<p class="p24">Shews not, &lsquo;till it be struck: our gentle flame</p>
<p class="p24">Provokes itself, and, like the current flies</p>
<p class="p24">Each bound it chafes. What have you there!]</p>
<p class="p24">This speech of the poet is very obscure. He seems to boast the copiousness and facility of his vein, by declaring that verses drop from a poet as gums from odoriferous trees, and that his flame kindles itself without the violence necessary to elicit sparkles from the flint. What follows next? that it, <span class="t8">like a current, flies each bound it chafes</span>. This may mean, that it expands itself notwithstanding all obstructions: but the images in the comparison are so ill-sorted, and the effect so obscurely expressed, that I cannot but think something omitted that connected the last sentence with the former. It is well knovn that the players often shorten speeches to quicken the representation; and it may be suspected, that they sometimes performed their amputations with more haste than judgment, (see 1765, VI, 169, 6)</p>
<p class="p24">I.i.27 (274,9) <span class="t8">Poet</span>. Upon the heels of my presentment, sir.] As soon as my book has been presented to lord Timon.</p>
<p class="p24">I.i.29 (274,1) This comes off weil and excellent] [By this we are to understand what the painters call the <span class="t8">goings off</span> of a picture, which requires the nicest execution. WARBURTON.] The note I understand less than the text. The meaning is, This figure rises weil from the canvas. <span class="t8">C&rsquo;est bien relevè.</span></p>
<p class="p24">I.i.37 (275,3) artificial strife] <span class="t8">Strife</span> is either the contest or act with nature.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Hic ille est</span> Raphael, <span class="t8">timuit, quo aospite vinci</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Rerum magna parens, &amp; moriente, mori</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">Or it is the contrast of forms or opposition of colours.</p>
<p class="p24">I.i.43 (275,4) this confluence, this great flood of visitors] <span class="t8">Mane salutantúm totis vomit aedibus undam</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">I.1.46 (275,5) Halts not particularly] My design does not stop at any single characters.</p>
<p class="p24">I.1.47 (276,7)</p>
<p class="p24">no levell&rsquo;d malice</p>
<p class="p24">Infects one comma in the course I hold;</p>
<p class="p24">But flies an eagle-flight, bold, and forth on,</p>
<p class="p24">Leaving no tract behind]</p>
<p class="p24">To <span class="t8">level</span> is to <span class="t8">aim</span>, to point the shot at a mark. Shakespeare&rsquo;s meaning is, my poem is not a satire written with any particular view, or <span class="t8">levelled</span> at any single person; I fly like an eagle into the general expanse of life, and leave not, by any private mischief, the trace of my passage.</p>
<p class="p24">I.i.51 (276,8) I&rsquo;ll unbolt] I&rsquo;ll open, I&rsquo;ll explain.</p>
<p class="p24">I.i.53 (276,9) glib and slippery creatures] Hanmer, and Warburton after him, read, <span class="t8">natures</span>. <span class="t8">Slippery</span> is <span class="t8">smooth</span>, unresisting.</p>
<p class="p24">I.i.58 (276,1) glass-fac&rsquo;d flatterer] That shows in his own look, as by reflection, the looks of his patron.</p>
<p class="p24">I.i.65 (277,3) rank&rsquo;d with all deserts] <span class="t8">Cover&rsquo;d with ranks</span> of all kinds of men.</p>
<p class="p24">I.i.67 (277,4) To propagate their states] To advance or improve their various conditions of life.</p>
<p class="p24">I.i.72 (277,5) conceiv&rsquo;d to scope] Properly imagined, appositely, to the purpose.</p>
<p class="p24">I.i.82 (278,8) through him/Drink the free air] That is, catch his breath in affected fondness.</p>
<p class="p24">I.i.90 (278,9) A thousand moral paintings I can shew] Shakespeare seems to intend in this dialogue to express some competition between the two great arts of imitation. Whatever the poet declares himself to have shewn, the painter thinks he could have shewn better. (1773)</p>
<p class="p24">I.i.107 (279,1) &rsquo;Tis not enough to help the feeble up,/But to support him after] This thought is better expressed by Dr. Madden in his elegy on archbishop Boulter.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&mdash; <span class="t8">He thought it mean</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Only to help the poor to beg again.</span></p>
<p class="p24">I.i.129 (280,2) Therefore he will be, Timon] I rather think an emendation necessary, and read,</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Therefore</span> well be him, <span class="t8">Timon.</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">His honesty rewards him in itself.</span></p>
<p class="p24">That is, <span class="t8">If he in honest</span>, bene fit illi, <span class="t8">I wish him the proper happiness of an honest man, but his honesty gives him no claim to my daughter</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">The first transcriber probably wrote <span class="t8">will be him</span>, which the next, not understanding, changed to, <span class="t8">he will be</span>. (1773)</p>
<p class="p24">I.i.149 (281,3)</p>
<p class="p24">never may</p>
<p class="p24">That state, or fortune, fall into my keeping,</p>
<p class="p24">Which is not ow&rsquo;d to you!]</p>
<p class="p24">The meaning is, let me never henceforth consider any thing that I possess, but as <span class="t8">owed</span> or <span class="t8">due</span> to you; held for your service, and at your disposal.</p>
<p class="p24">I.i.159 (281,4) pencil&rsquo;d figures are/Even such as they give out] Pictures have no hypocrisy; they are what they profess to be.</p>
<p class="p24">I.i.165 (282,5) unclew me quite] To <span class="t8">unclew</span>, is to <span class="t8">unwind</span> a ball of thread. To <span class="t8">unclew</span> a man, is to draw out the whole mass of his fortunes.</p>
<p class="p24">I.i.171 (282,5) Are prized by their masters] Are rated according to the, esteem in which their possessor is held.</p>
<p class="p24">I.i.178 (282,8)</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Tim.</span> Good-morrow to thee, gentle Apemantua!</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Apam.</span> &lsquo;Till I be gentle, stay for thy good-morrow.</p>
<p class="p24">When thou art Timon&rsquo;s dog, and these knaves honest, &mdash; ]</p>
<p class="p24">[Warburton conjectured a line lost and added one of his own making] I think my punctuation may clear the passage without any greater effort.</p>
<p class="p24">I.i.180 (283,9) Then thou art Timon&rsquo;s dog] When thou hast gotten a better character, and instead of being Timon, as thou art, shalt be changed to Timon&rsquo;s dog, and become more worth; of kindness and salutation. (1773)</p>
<p class="p24">I.i.241 (284,9) That I had no angry wit to be a lord] [W: so hungry a wit] The meaning may be, I should hate myself for <span class="t8">patiently enduring to be a lord</span>. This is ill enough expressed. Perhaps some happy change may set it right. I have tried, and can do nothing, yet I cannot heartily concur with Dr. Warburton.</p>
<p class="p24">I.i.259 (286,2) The strain of man&rsquo;s bred out/Into baboon and monkey] Man is exhausted and degenerated; his <span class="t8">strain</span> or lineage is worn down into monkey.</p>
<p class="p24">I.ii.12 (288,5)</p>
<p class="p24">If our betters play at that game, we must not dare</p>
<p class="p24">To imitate them. Faults that are rich, are fair]</p>
<p class="p24">[Warburton gave the second line to Apemantus] I cannot see that these lines are more proper in any other mouth than Timon&rsquo;s, to whose character of generosity and condescension they are very suitable. To suppose that by <span class="t8">our betters</span> are meant the Gods, is very harsh, because to imitate the Gods has been hitherto reckoned the highest pitch of human virtue. The whole is a trite and obvious thought, uttered by Timon with a kind of affected modesty. If I would make any alteration, it should be only to reform the numbers thus:</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Our betters play that game; we must not dare</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">T&rsquo; imitate then; faults that are rich are fair.</span></p>
<p class="p24">I.ii.34 (289,6) thou art an Athenian,/Therefore welcome: I myself would have no power] If this be the true reading, the sense is, <span class="t8">all Athenians are welcome to share my fortune</span>; I would myself have no <span class="t8">exclusive right or power in this house</span>. Perhaps we might read, <span class="t8">I myself would have no</span> poor. I would have every Athenian consider himself as joint possessor of my fortune.</p>
<p class="p24">I.ii.38 (289,7) I scorn thy meat, &rsquo;twould choke me, for I should/ Ne&rsquo;er flatter thee] [W: &lsquo;fore/I should e&rsquo;er] Of this emendation there is little need. The meaning is, I could not swallow thy meat, for I could not pay for it with flattery; and what was given me with an ill will would stick in my throat.</p>
<p class="p24">I.ii.41 (290,8) so many dip their meat/In one man&rsquo;s blood] The allusion is to a pack of hounds trained to pursuit by being gratified with the blood of the animal which they kill, and the wonder is that the animal on which they are feeding <span class="t8">cheers them</span> to the chase.</p>
<p class="p24">I.ii.52 (290,9) wind-pipe&rsquo;s dangerous notes] The notes of the windpipe seem to be the only indications which shew where the windpipe is. (see 1765, VI, 184, 4)</p>
<p class="p24">I.ii.54 (290,1) My lord, in heart] That is, <span class="t8">my lord&rsquo;s health with sincerity</span>. An emendation hat been proposed thus:</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">My</span> love <span class="t8">in heart</span>; &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">but it is not necessary.</p>
<p class="p24">I.ii.89 (292,2) we should think ourselves for ever perfect] That is, arrived at the perfection of happiness.</p>
<p class="p24">I.ii.94 (292,4) did not you chiefly belong to my heart?] I think it should be inverted thus: <span class="t8">did I not chiefly belong to</span> your hearts. Lacius wishes that Timon would give him and the rest an opportunity <span class="t8">of expressing some part of their zeals</span>. Timon answers that, <span class="t8">doubtless the Gods have provided that I should have help from you; how else are you my friends</span>? why are you stiled my friends, if &mdash; what? <span class="t8">if I do not love you</span>. Such is the present reading; but the consequence is not very clear; the proper close must be, <span class="t8">if you do not love me</span>, and to this my alteration restores it. But, perhaps, the old reading may stand. [The <span class="t8">Revisal</span>&rsquo;s note on this line is quoted.] The meaning is probably this. Why are you distinguished from thousands by that title of endearment, was there not a particular connection and intercourse of tenderness between you and me. (see 1765, VI, 185, 8)</p>
<p class="p24">I.ii.97 (293,5) I confirm you] I fix your characters firmly in my own mind.</p>
<p class="p24">I.ii.99 (293,7) O joy, e&rsquo;en made away, ere it can be born!] For this Hanmer writes, <span class="t8">O joy, e&rsquo;en made a joy ere&rsquo;t can be born</span>; and is followed by Dr. Warburton. I am always inclinable to think well of that which is approved by so much learning and sagacity, yet cannot receive this alteration. Tears being the effect both of joy and grief, supplied our author with an opportunity of conceit, which he seldom fails to indulge. Timon, weeping with a kind of tender pleasure, cries out, <span class="t8">O joy, e&rsquo;en made away</span>, destroyed, turned to tears, before <span class="t8">it can be born</span>, before it can be fully possessed.</p>
<p class="p24">I.ii.110 (293,8) Mine eyes cannot hold water, methinks: to forget their faults, I drink to you] In the original edition the words stand thus: <span class="t8">mine eyes cannot hold out water, methinks. To forget their faults, I drink to you</span>. Perhaps the true reading is this, <span class="t8">Mine eyes cannot hold out</span>; they <span class="t8">water. Methinks, to forget their faults, I will drink to you</span>. Or it may be explained without any change. <span class="t8">Mine eyes cannot hold out water</span>, that is, cannot keep water from breaking in upon them, (see 1765, VI, 186, 2)</p>
<p class="p24">I.ii.113 (294,9) <span class="t8">Apem</span>. Thou weep&rsquo;st to make them drink] Hanmer reads,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&mdash; <span class="t8">to make then drink</span> thee,</p>
<p class="p24">and is again followed by Dr. Warburton, I think without sufficient reason. The covert sense of Apemantus is, <span class="t8">what thou losest, they get</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">I.ii.118 (294,1) like a babe] That is a <span class="t8">weeping babe</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">I.ii.138 (295,3)</p>
<p class="p24">They dance! They are mad women.</p>
<p class="p24">Like madness is the glory of this life,</p>
<p class="p24">As this pomp shews to a little oil and root]</p>
<p class="p24">[Warburton conjectured some lines lost after the second verse] When I read this passage, I was at first of the same opinion with this learned man; but, upon longer consideration, I grew less confident, because I think the present reading susceptible of explanation, with no more violence to language than is frequently found in our author. <span class="t8">The glory of this life is very near to madness</span>, as may be made appear from <span class="t8">this pomp</span>, exhibited in a place where a philosopher is feeding on <span class="t8">oil and roots</span>. When we see by example how few are the necessaries of life, we learn what madness there is in so much superfluity.</p>
<p class="p24">I.ii.146 (296,5) who dies, that bears/Not one spurn to their graves, of their friends gift?] That is, given them by their friends.(1773)</p>
<p class="p24">I.ii.155 (297,6) mine own device] The mask appears to have been design&rsquo;d by Timon to surprise his guests.</p>
<p class="p24">I.ii.157 (297,7) <span class="t8">L Lady</span>. My lord, you take us even at the best] This answer seems rather to belong to one of the ladies. It was probably only mark&rsquo;d <span class="t8">L</span> in the copy.</p>
<p class="p24">I.ii.169 (298,1) &rsquo;Tis pity, bounty has not eyes behind] To see the miseries that are following her.</p>
<p class="p24">I.ii.170 (298,2) That man might ne&rsquo;er be wretched for his mind] For nobleness of soul.</p>
<p class="p24">I.ii.176 (298,3) to/Advance this jewel] To prefer it; to raise it to honour by wearing it.</p>
<p class="p24">I.ii.230 (300,6)</p>
<p class="p24">all the lands thou hast</p>
<p class="p24">Lie in a pitch&rsquo;d field.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Alc.</span> I&rsquo; defiled land, my lord]</p>
<p class="p24">This is the old reading, which apparently depends on a very low quibble. Alcibiades is told, that <span class="t8">his estate lies in a</span> pitch&rsquo;d <span class="t8">field</span>. Now <span class="t8">pitch</span>, as Falstaff says, <span class="t8">doth defile</span>. Alcibiades therefore replies, that his estate lies <span class="t8">in defiled land</span>. This, as it happened, was not understood, and all the editors published,</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">I defy land</span>, &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">I.ii.237 (301,8) Serving of becks] [W: serring] The commentator conceives <span class="t8">beck</span> to mean the <span class="t8">mouth</span> or the <span class="t8">head</span>, after the French, <span class="t8">bec</span>, whereas it means a salutation made with the head. So Milton,</p>
<p class="p24">&ldquo;Nods and <span class="t8">becks</span>, and wreathed smiles.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">To <span class="t8">serve a beck</span>, is to offer a salutation.</p>
<p class="p24">I.ii.238 (301,9) I doubt, whether their legs] He plays upon the word <span class="t8">leg</span>, as it signifies a <span class="t8">limb</span> and a <span class="t8">bow</span> or <span class="t8">act of obeisance</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">I.ii.247 (302,1) I fear me, thou/Wilt give away thyself in paper shortly] [W: in proper] Hanmer reads very plausibly,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&mdash; <span class="t8">thou</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Wilt give away thyself</span> in perpetuum.</p>
<p class="p24">I.ii.235 (302,2) I&rsquo;ll lock/Thy heaven from thee] The pleasure of being flattered.</p>
<p class="p24">II.i.10 (304,5) No porter at his gate;/But rather one that smiles, and still invites] I imagine that a line is lost here, in which the behaviour of a surly porter was described.</p>
<p class="p24">II.i.12 (304,6) no reason/Can found his state in safety] The supposed meaning of this [Can sound his state] must be, <span class="t8">No reason</span>, by <span class="t8">sounding</span>, fathoming, or trying, <span class="t8">his state</span>, can find it <span class="t8">safe</span>. But as the words stand, they imply, that <span class="t8">no reason can</span> safely <span class="t8">sound his state</span>. I read thus,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&mdash; <span class="t8">no reason</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Can</span> found <span class="t8">his state in safety</span>. &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Reason</span> cannot find his fortune to have any <span class="t8">safe</span> or solid <span class="t8">foundation</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">The types of the first printer of this play were so worn and defaced, that <span class="t8">f</span> and <span class="t8">s</span> are not always to be distinguished.</p>
<p class="p24">II.ii.5 (305,9) Never mind/Was to be so unwise, to be so kind] Of this mode of expression conversation affords many examples: &ldquo;I was always to be blamed, whatever happened.&rdquo; &ldquo;I am in the lottery, but I was always to draw blanks.&rdquo; (1773)</p>
<p class="p24">II.ii.9 (306,1) Good even, Varro] It is observable, that this <span class="t8">good evening</span> is before dinner; for Timon tells Alcibiades, that they will <span class="t8">go forth again as soon as dinner&rsquo;s done</span>, which may prove that by <span class="t8">dinner</span> our author meant not the <span class="t8">coena</span> of ancient times, but the mid-day&rsquo;s repast. I do not suppose the passage corrupt: such inadvertencies neither author nor editor can escape.</p>
<p class="p24">There is another remark to be made. Varro and Isidore sink a few lines afterwards into the servants of Varro and Isidore. Whether servants, in our author&rsquo;s time, took the names of their masters, I know not. Perhaps it is a slip of negligence.</p>
<p class="p24">II.ii.47 (308,4) <span class="t8">Enter Apemantus and a Fool</span>] I suspect some scene to be lost, in which the entrance of the fool, and the page that follows him, was prepared by some introductory dialogue, in which the audience was informed that they were the fool and page of Phrynia, Timandra, or some other courtesan, upon the knowledge of which depends the greater part of the ensuing jocularity.</p>
<p class="p24">II.ii.60-66 (309,4) Poor rogues] This is said so abruptly, that I am inclined to think it misplaced, and would regulate the passage thus:</p>
<p class="p24">Caph. <span class="t8">Where&rsquo;s the fool now?</span></p>
<p class="p24">Apem. <span class="t8">He last ask&rsquo;d the question.</span></p>
<p class="p24">All. <span class="t8">What are we, Apemantus?</span></p>
<p class="p24">Apem. <span class="t8">Asses.</span></p>
<p class="p24">All. <span class="t8">Why?</span></p>
<p class="p24">Apem. <span class="t8">That you ask me what you are, and do not know yourselves. Poor rogues&rsquo;, and usurers&rsquo; men! bawds between</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">gold and want! Speak</span>, &amp;c.</p>
<p class="p24">Thus every word will have its proper place. It is likely that the passage transposed was forgot in the copy, and inserted in the margin, perhaps a little beside the proper place, which the transcriber wanting either skill or care to observe, wrote it where it now stands.</p>
<p class="p24">II.ii.71 (309,5) She&rsquo;s e&rsquo;en setting on water to scald] The old name for the disease got at Corinth was the <span class="t8">brenning</span>, and a sense of <span class="t8">scalding</span> is one of its first symptoms.</p>
<p class="p24">II.ii.117 (311,7) with two stones more than&rsquo;s artificial one] Meaning the celebrated philosopher&rsquo;s stone, which was in those times much talked of. Sir Thomas Smith was one of those who lost considerable sums in seeking of it.</p>
<p class="p24">II.ii.152 (312,9) Though you hear now, yet now&rsquo;s too late a time] [Warburton objected to this, an emendation by Hanmer] I think Hanmer right, and have received his emendation.</p>
<p class="p24">Il.ii.155 (313,1) and at length/How goes our reckoning?] [W: Hold good our] It is common enough, and the commentator knows it is common to propose interrogatively, that of which neither the speaker nor the hearer has any doubt. The present reading may therefore stand.</p>
<p class="p24">II.ii.171 (314,2) a wasteful cock] [i.e. a <span class="t8">cockloft</span>, a garret. And a <span class="t8">wasteful cock</span>, signifies a garret lying in waste, neglected, put to no use. HANMER.] Hanmer&rsquo;s explanation is received by Dr. Warburton, yet I think them both apparently mistaken. A <span class="t8">wasteful cock</span> is a <span class="t8">cock</span> or pipe with a turning stopple <span class="t8">running</span> to <span class="t8">waste</span>. In this sense, both the terms have their usual meaning; but I know not that <span class="t8">cock</span> is ever used for <span class="t8">cockloft</span>, or <span class="t8">wasteful</span> for <span class="t8">lying in waste</span>, or that lying in waste is at all a phrase.</p>
<p class="p24">Il.ii.187 (314,4) And try the arguments] [<span class="t8">Arguments</span> for natures. <span class="t8">WARB</span>.] How <span class="t8">arguments</span> should stand for natures I do not see. But the licentiousness of our author forces us often upon far fetched expositions. <span class="t8">Arguments</span> may mean <span class="t8">contents</span>, as the <span class="t8">arguments</span> of a book; or for <span class="t8">evidences</span> and <span class="t8">proofs</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">II.ii.209 (315,5) I knew it the most general way] <span class="t8">General</span> is not speedy, but <span class="t8">compendious</span>, the way to try many at a time.</p>
<p class="p24">II.ii.219 (316,6) And so, intending other serious matters] <span class="t8">Intending</span> is <span class="t8">regarding, turning their notice</span> to other things.</p>
<p class="p24">II.ii.220 (316,7) these hard fractions] [Warburton saw an allusion to fractions in mathematics] This is, I think, no conceit in the head of Flavius, who, by <span class="t8">fractions</span>, means <span class="t8">broken</span> hints, <span class="t8">interrupted</span> sentences, <span class="t8">abrupt</span> remarks.</p>
<p class="p24">II.ii.221 (316,8) half-caps] A <span class="t8">half cap</span> is a <span class="t8">cap</span> slightly moved, not put off.</p>
<p class="p24">II.ii.241 (317,3) I would, I could not] The original edition has, <span class="t8">I would, I could not think it, that thought</span>, &amp;c. It has been changed [&lsquo;Would], to mend the numbers, without authority.</p>
<p class="p24">II.ii.242 (317,4)</p>

<p class="p24">III.ii.24 (321,5) yet had he mistook him, and sent him to me] [W: mislook&rsquo;d] I rather read, <span class="t8">yet had he</span> not <span class="t8">mistook him, and sent to me</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">III.ii.45 (322,7) If his occasion were not virtuous] [<span class="t8">Virtuous</span>, for strong, forcible, pressing. <span class="t8">WARBURTON</span>.] The meaning may more naturally be; &mdash; If he did not want it for a good use. (1773)</p>
<p class="p24">III.ii.51 (322,9) that I should purchase the day before for a little part, and undo a great deal of honour?] [T: a little dirt] This emendation is received, like all others, by sir T. Hanmer, but neglected by Dr. Warburton. I think Theobald right in suspecting a corruption; nor is his emendation injudicious, though perhaps we may better read, <span class="t8">purchase the day before for a little park</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">III.ii.71 (323,1) And just of the same piece is every flatterer&rsquo;s soul] This is Dr. Warburton&rsquo;s emendation. The other editions read,</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Why this is the world&rsquo;s soul;</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Of the same piece is every flatterer&rsquo;s</span> sport.</p>
<p class="p24">Mr. Upton has not unluckily transposed the two final words, thus,</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Why, this is the world&rsquo;s</span> sport:</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Of the same piece is ev&rsquo;ry flatterer&rsquo;s</span> soul.</p>
<p class="p24">The passage is not so obscure as to provoke so much enquiry. <span class="t8">This</span>, says he, <span class="t8">is the soul</span> or spirit <span class="t8">of the world: every flatterer</span> plays the same game, makes <span class="t8">sport</span> with the confidence of his friend. (see 1765, VI, 211, 4)</p>
<p class="p24">III.ii.81 (324,2) He does deny him, in respect of his, What charitable men afford to beggars] That is, <span class="t8">in respect of his</span> fortune, what Lucius denies to Timon is in proportion to what Lucius possesses, less than the ususal alms given by good men to beggars.</p>
<p class="p24">III.ii.90 (324,3) I would have put my wealth into donation, And the best half should ha&rsquo; return&rsquo;d to him] Hanmer reads,</p>

<p class="p24"><span class="t8">And the best half should have</span> attorn&rsquo;d <span class="t8">to him</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">Dr. Warbarton receives <span class="t8">attorn&rsquo;d</span>. The only difficulty is in the word <span class="t8">return&rsquo;d</span>, which, since he had received nothing from him, cannot be used but in a very low and licentious meaning, (see 1765, VI, 212, 6)</p>
<p class="p24">III.iii.5 (325,4) They have all been touch&rsquo;d] That is, <span class="t8">tried</span>, alluding to the <span class="t8">touchstone</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">III.iii.11 (325,5) His friends, like physicians,/Thrive, give him over?] The original reading is,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&mdash; his friends, (<span class="t8">like physicians</span>)</p>
<p class="p24">Thrive, give him over?</p>
<p class="p24">which Theobald has misrepresented. Hanmer reads, <span class="t8">try&rsquo;d</span>, plausibly enough. Instead of <span class="t8">three</span> proposed by Mr. Pope, I should read <span class="t8">thrice</span>. But perhaps the old reading is the true.</p>
<p class="p24">III.iii.24 (326,6) I had such a courage] Such an ardour, such an eager desire.</p>
<p class="p24">III.iii.28 (326,8) The devil knew not what he did] I cannot but think that, the negative <span class="t8">not</span> has intruded into this passage, and the reader will think so too, when he reads Dr. Warburton&rsquo;s explanation of the next words.</p>
<p class="p24">III.iii.28 (326,9) The devil knew not what he did, when he made men politick; he cross&rsquo;d himself by&rsquo;t: and I cannot think, but in the end the villainies of man will set him clear] [<span class="t8">Set him clear</span> does not mean acquit him before heaven; for then <span class="t8">the devil</span> must be supposed <span class="t8">to know what</span> he did: but it signifies puzzle him, outdo him at his own weapons. WARBURTON.] How the devil, or any other being, should be <span class="t8">set clear</span> by being <span class="t8">puzzled</span> and <span class="t8">outdone</span>, the commentator has not explained. When in a crowd we would have an opening made, we say, <span class="t8">Stand clear</span>, that is, <span class="t8">out of the way of danger</span>. With some affinity to this use, though not without great harshness, to <span class="t8">set clear</span>, may be to <span class="t8">set aside</span>. But I believe the original corruption is the insertion of the negative, which was obtruded by some transcriber, who supposed <span class="t8">crossed</span> to mean <span class="t8">thwarted</span>, when it meant, <span class="t8">exempted from evil</span>. The use of <span class="t8">crossing</span>, by way of protection or purification, was probably not worn out in Shakespeare&rsquo;s time. The sense of <span class="t8">set clear</span> is now easy; he has no longer the guilt of tempting man. To cross himself may mean, in a very familiar sense, <span class="t8">to clear his score, to get out of debt, to quit his reckoning</span>. He knew not <span class="t8">what he did</span>, may mean, he knew not how much good he was doing himself. There is then no need of emendation. (1773)</p>
<p class="p24">III.iii.42 (327,2) keep his house] i.e. keep within doors for fear of duns.</p>

<p class="p24">Of comely virtues:</p>
<p class="p24">Nor did he soil the fact with cowardise;</p>
<p class="p24">(An honour in him which buys out his fault)]</p>
<p class="p24">I have printed these lines after the original copy, except that, for <span class="t8">an honour</span>, it is there, <span class="t8">and honour</span>. All the latter editions deviate unwarrantably from the original, and give the lines thus:</p>

<p class="p24">The original copy reads not <span class="t8">behave</span> but <span class="t8">behoove</span>. I do not well understand the passage in either reading. Shall we try a daring conjecture?</p>

<p class="p24"><span class="t8">He did behold his adversary shent,</span></p>

<p class="p24">[Warburton had substituted &ldquo;hands&rdquo; for &ldquo;lands&rdquo;] I think <span class="t8">hands</span> is very properly substituted for <span class="t8">lands</span>.

<p class="p24">III.vi.4 (339,7) Upon that were my thoughts tiring] A hawk, I think, is said to <span class="t8">tire</span>, when she amuses herself with pecking a pheasant&rsquo;s wing, or any thing that puts her in mind of prey. To <span class="t8">tire</span> upon a thing, is therefore, to be <span class="t8">idly employed upon it</span>.</p>

<p class="p24">IV.ii (345,1) Enter Flavius] Nothing contributes more to the exaltation of Timon&rsquo;s character than the zeal and fidelity of his servants. Nothing but real virtue can be honoured by domesticks; nothing but impartial kindness can gain affection from dependants.</p>

<p class="p24">IV.ii.38 (346,4) strange unusual blood] Of this passage, I suppose, every reader would wish for a correction; but the word, harsh as it is, stands fortified by the rhyme, to which, perhaps, it owes its introduction. I know not what to propose. Perhaps,</p>

<p class="p24">IV.iii.6 (348,7) Not nature,/To whom all sores lay siege] I have preserved this note rather for the sake of the commentator [Warburton] than of the author. How <span class="t8">nature, to whom all sores lay siege</span>, can so emphatically express <span class="t8">nature in its greatest perfection</span>, I shall not endeavour to explain. The meaning I take to be this: <span class="t8">Brother, when his fortune is inlarged, will scorn brother</span>; for this is the general depravity of human nature, which, <span class="t8">besieged as it is by misery</span>, admonished as it is of want and imperfection, when <span class="t8">elevated by fortune, will despise</span> beings of <span class="t8">nature like its own</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.iii.12 (349,9) It is the pastor lards the brother&rsquo;s sides,/The want that makes him leave] [W: weather&rsquo;s sides] This passage is very obscure, nor do I discover any clear sense, even though we should admit the emendation. Let us inspect the text as I have given it from the original edition,</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">It is the</span> pastour <span class="t8">lards the</span> brother&rsquo;s <span class="t8">sides,</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">The want that makes him</span> leave.</p>
<p class="p24">Dr. Warburton found the passage already changed thus,</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">It is the</span> pasture <span class="t8">lards the</span> beggar&rsquo;s <span class="t8">sides,</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">The want that makes him</span> lean.</p>
<p class="p24">And upon this reading of no authority, raised another equally uncertain.</p>
<p class="p24">Alterations are never to be made without necessity. Let us see what sense the genuine reading will afford. Poverty, says the poet, <span class="t8">bears contempt hereditary</span>, and <span class="t8">wealth native honour</span>. To illustrate this position, having already mentioned the case of a poor and rich brother, he remarks, that this preference is given to wealth by those whom it least becomes; <span class="t8">it is the</span> pastour <span class="t8">that greases or</span> flatters <span class="t8">the rich</span> brother, and will grease him on till <span class="t8">want makes him leave</span>. The poet then goes on to ask, <span class="t8">Who dares to say this man</span>, this pastour, <span class="t8">is a flatterer</span>; the crime is universal; through all the world <span class="t8">the learned pate</span>, with allusion to the pastour, <span class="t8">ducks to the golden fool</span>. If it be objected, as it may justly be, that the mention of pastour is unsuitable, we must remember the mention of <span class="t8">grace</span> and <span class="t8">cherubims</span> in this play, and many such anachronisms in many others. I would therefore read thus:</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">It is the pastour lards the brother&rsquo;s sides</span>,</p>
<p class="p24">&rsquo;Tis <span class="t8">want that makes him leave</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">The obscurity is still great. Perhaps a line is lost. I have at least given the original reading.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.iii.27 (350,2) no idle votarist] No insincere or inconstant supplicant. <span class="t8">Gold</span> will not serve me instead of <span class="t8">roots</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.iii.38 (351,5) That makes the wappen&rsquo;d widow wed again] Of <span class="t8">wappened</span> I have found no example, nor know any meaning. To <span class="t8">awhape</span> is used by Spenser in his <span class="t8">Hubberd&rsquo;s Tale</span>, but I think not in either of the senses mentioned. I would read <span class="t8">wained</span>, for <span class="t8">decayed by time</span>. So our author in <span class="t8">Richard the Third</span>, <span class="t8">A beauty</span>-waining <span class="t8">and distressed widow</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.iii.41 (352,6) To the April day again] That is, <span class="t8">to the wedding day</span>, called by the poet, satirically, <span class="t8">April day</span>, or <span class="t8">fool&rsquo;s day</span>.</p>

<p class="p24">IV.iii.134 (357,8) And to make whores a bawd] [W: make whole] The old edition reads,</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">And to make whores a bawd.</span></p>
<p class="p24">That is, <span class="t8">enough to make a whore leave whoring, and a bawd leave making whores</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.iii.139 (357,9) I&rsquo;ll trust to your conditions] You need not swear to continue whores, I will trust to your inclinations.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.iii.140 (358,1) Yet may your pains, six months,/Be quite contrary] The explanation [Warburton&rsquo;s] is ingenious, but I think it very remote, and would willingly bring the author and his readers to meet on easier terms. We may read,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&mdash; <span class="t8">Yet may your pains six months</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Be quite</span> contraried. &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">Timon is wishing ill to mankind, but is afraid lest the whores should imagine that he wishes well to them; to obviate which he lets them know, that he imprecates upon them influence enough to plague others, and disappointments enough to plague themselves. He wishes that they may do all possible mischief, and yet take <span class="t8">pains six months</span> of the year in vain.</p>
<p class="p24">In this sense there is a connection of this line with the next. Finding <span class="t8">your pains contraried</span>, try new expedients, <span class="t8">thatch your thin roofs</span>, and <span class="t8">paint</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">To <span class="t8">contrary</span> is on old verb. Latymer relates, that when he went to court, he was advised not to <span class="t8">contrary</span> the king.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.iii.153 (359,3) mens&rsquo; spurring] Hanmer reads <span class="t8">sparring</span>, properly enough, if there be any ancient example of the word.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.iii.158 (359,5)</p>
<p class="p24">take the bridge quite away</p>
<p class="p24">Of him, that his particular to foresee</p>
<p class="p24">Smells from the general weal]</p>
<p class="p24">[W: to forefend] The metaphor is apparently incongruous, but the sense is good. To <span class="t8">foresee his particular</span>, is <span class="t8">to provide for his private advantage</span>, for which <span class="t8">he leaves the right scent of publick good</span>. In hunting, when hares have cross&rsquo;d one another, it is common for some of the hounds <span class="t8">to smell from the general weal, and foresee their own particular</span>. Shakespeare, who seems to have been a skilful sportsman, and has alluded often to falconry, perhaps, alludes here to hunting.</p>
<p class="p24">To the commentator&rsquo;s emendation it may be objected, that he used <span class="t8">forefend</span> in the wrong meaning. To <span class="t8">forefend</span>, is, I think, never to <span class="t8">provide for</span>, but to <span class="t8">provide against</span>. The verbs compounded with <span class="t8">for</span> or <span class="t8">fore</span> have commonly either an evil or negative sense.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.iii.182 (361,8) eyeless venom&rsquo;d worm] The serpent, which we, from the smallness of his eyes, call the <span class="t8">blind worm</span>, and the Latins, <span class="t8">caecilia</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.iii.183 (361,9) below crisp heaven] [W: cript] Mr. Upton declares for <span class="t8">crisp</span>, curled, bent, hollow.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.iii.188 (361,1) Let it no more bring out ingrateful man!] [W: out to ungrateful] It is plain that <span class="t8">bring out</span> is <span class="t8">bring forth</span>, with which the following lines correspond so plainly, that the commentator might be suspected of writing his note without reading the whole passage.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.iii.193 (362,2) Dry up thy marrows, vines, and plough torn leas] I cannot concur to censure Theobald [as Warburton did] as a <span class="t8">critic</span> very <span class="t8">unhappy</span>. He was weak, but he was cautious: finding but little power in his mind, he rarely ventured far under its conduct. This timidity hindered him from daring conjectures, and sometimes hindered him happily.</p>
<p class="p24">This passage, among many others, may pass without change. The genuine reading is not <span class="t8">marrows, veins</span>, but <span class="t8">marrows</span>, vines: the sense is this; <span class="t8">O nature! cease</span> to <span class="t8">produce men, ensear thy womb</span>; but if thou wilt continue to produce them, at least cease to pamper them; <span class="t8">dry up thy marrows</span>, on which they fatten with <span class="t8">unctuous morsels</span>, thy <span class="t8">vines</span>, which give them <span class="t8">liquorish draughts</span>, and thy <span class="t8">plow-torn leas</span>. Here are effects corresponding with causes, <span class="t8">liquorish draughts</span> with <span class="t8">vines</span>, and <span class="t8">unctuous morsels</span> with <span class="t8">marrows</span>, and the old reading literally preserved.</p>

<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Tim.</span> Always a villain&rsquo;s office, or a fool&rsquo;s.</p>

<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Apem.</span> Ay.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Tim.</span> What! a knave too?]</p>
<p class="p24">Such was Dr. Warburton&rsquo;s first conjecture [&ldquo;and know&rsquo;t too&rdquo;], but afterwards he adopted Sir T. Hanmer&rsquo;s conjecture,</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">What a knave</span> thou!</p>
<p class="p24">but there is no need of alteration. Timon had just called Apemantus <span class="t8">fool</span>, in consequence of what he had known of him by former acquaintance; but when Apemantus tells him, that he comes <span class="t8">to vex him</span>, Timon determines that to <span class="t8">vex</span> is either <span class="t8">the office of a villain or a fool</span>; that <span class="t8">to vex by design</span> is <span class="t8">villainy, to vex without design</span> is <span class="t8">folly</span>. He then properly asks Apemantus whether he takes delight in <span class="t8">vexing</span>, and when he answers, <span class="t8">yes</span>, Timon replies, <span class="t8">What! and knave too?</span> I before only knew thee to be a <span class="t8">fool</span>, but I now find thee likewise a <span class="t8">knave</span>. This seems to be so clear as not to stand in need of a comment.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.iii.242 (365,6) Willing misery/Out-lives incertain pomp; is crown&rsquo;d before] Arrives sooner at <span class="t8">high wish</span>; that is, at the <span class="t8">completion of its wishes</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.iii.247 (365,7) Worse than the worst, content] Best states contentless have a wretched being, a being worse than that of the worst states that are content. This one would think too plain to have been mistaken. (1773)</p>
<p class="p24">IV.iii.249 (365,8) by his breath] It means, I believe, by his <span class="t8">counsel</span>, by his <span class="t8">direction</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">IV. iii. 252 (366,l) Hadst thou, like us] There is in this speech a sullen haughtiness, and malignant dignity, suitable at once to the lord and the man-hater. The impatience with which he bears to have his luxury reproached by one that never had luxury within his reach, is natural and graceful.</p>
<p class="p24">There is in a letter, written by the earl of Essex, just before his execution, to another nobleman, a passage somewhat resembling this, with which, I believe every reader will be pleased, though it is so serious and solemn that it can scarcely be inserted without irreverence.</p>
<p class="p24">&ldquo;God grant your lordship may quickly feel the comfort I now enjoy in my unfettered conversion, but that you may never feel the torments I have suffered for my long delaying it. <span class="t8">I had none but deceivers to call upon me, to whom I said, if my ambition could have entered into their narrow breasts, they would not have been so precise. But your lordship hath one to call upon you, that knoweth what it is you now enjoy; and what the greatest fruit and end is of all contentment that this world can afford.</span> Think, therefore, dear earl, that I have staked and buoyed all the ways of pleasure unto you, and left them as sea-marks for you to keep the channel of religious virtue. For shut your eyes never so long, they must be open at the last, and then you must say with me, <span class="t8">there is no peace to the ungodly</span>.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="p24">IV.iii.259 (366,4) But myself] The connection here requires some attention. <span class="t8">But</span> is here used to denote opposition; but what immediately precedes is not opposed to that which follows. The adversative particle refers to the two first lines.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Thou art a slave, whom fortune&rsquo;s tender arm</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">With favour never claspt; but bred a dog.</span></p>

<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Who had the world as my confectionary,</span> &amp;c.</p>
<p class="p24">The intermediate lines are to be considered as a parenthesis of passion.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.iii.271 (367,5) If thou wilt curse, thy father, that poor rag,/ Must be thy subject] If we read <span class="t8">poor rogue</span>, it will correspond rather better to what follows.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.iii.276 (367,6) Thou hadst been knave and flatterer] Dryden has quoted two verses of Virgil to shew how well he could have written satires. Shakespeare has here given a specimen of the same power by a line bitter beyond all bitterness, in which Timon tells Apemantus, that he had not virtue enough for the vices which he condemns.</p>
<p class="p24">Dr. Warburton explains <span class="t8">worst</span> by <span class="t8">lowest</span>, which somewhat weakens the sense, and yet leaves it sufficiently vigorous.</p>
<p class="p24">I have heard Mr. Bourke commend the subtilty of discrimination with which Shakespeare distinguishes the present character of Timon from that of Apemantus, whom to vulgar eyes he would now resemble. (see 1763, VI, 249, 6) (rev. 1778, VIII, 424, 4)</p>
<p class="p24">IV.iii.308 (369,8) Ay, though it look like thee] Timon here supposes that an objection against hatred, which through the whole tenor of the conversation appears an argument for it. One would have expected him to have answered,</p>
<p class="p24">Yes, <span class="t8">for it looks like thee</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">The old edition, which always gives the pronoun instead of the affirmative particle, has it,</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">I, though it look like thee</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">Perhaps we should read,</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">I</span> thought <span class="t8">it</span> look&rsquo;d <span class="t8">like thee</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">IV,iii.363 (371,2) Thou art the cap] i.e. the property, the bubble. WARBURTON.] I rather think, the <span class="t8">top</span>, the <span class="t8">principal</span>.</p>

<p class="p24">IV.iii.398 (373,6) More things like men?] This line, in the old edition, is given to Aremantus, but it apparently belongs to Timon. Hanmer has transposed the foregoing dialogue according to his own mind, not unskilfully, but with unwarrantable licence.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.iii.419 (373,7) you want much of meat] [T: of meet] Such is Mr. Theobald&rsquo;s emendation, in which he is followed by Dr. Warburton. Sir T. Hanmer reads,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&mdash; <span class="t8">you want much of</span> men.</p>
<p class="p24">They have been all busy without necessity. Observe the series of the conversation. The thieves tell him, that they are <span class="t8">men that much do want</span>. Here is an ambiguity between <span class="t8">much want</span> and <span class="t8">want</span> of <span class="t8">much</span>. Timon takes it on the wrong side, and tells them that their <span class="t8">greatest want is</span>, that, like other men, <span class="t8">they want much of meat</span>; then telling them where meat may be had, he asks, <span class="t8">Want? why want?</span> (see 1765, VI, 254, 5)</p>
<p class="p24">IV.iii.420 (374,8) the earth hath roots;/Within this mile break forth an hundred springs]</p>

<p class="p24">I do not suppose these to be imitations, but only to be similar thoughts on similar occasions.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.iii.442 (375,2) The sea&rsquo;s a thief, whose liquid surge resolves/The moon into salt tears] [W: The mounds] I am not willing to receive <span class="t8">mounds</span>, which would not be understood but by him that suggested it. The <span class="t8">moon</span> is supposed to be humid, and perhaps a source of humidity, but cannot be <span class="t8">resolved</span> by the <span class="t8">surges</span> of the sea. Yet I think <span class="t8">moon</span> is the true reading. Here is a circulation of thievary described: The sun, moon, and sea all rob, and are robbed.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.iii.456 (376,3) &rsquo;Tis in the malice of mankind, that he thus advises us; not to have us thrive in our mystery] [Hanmer: his malice to] Hanmer&rsquo;s emendation, though not necessary, is very probable, and very unjustly charged with nonsense [by Warburton]. The reason of his advice, says the thief, is <span class="t8">malice to mankind</span>, not any kindness to us, or desire <span class="t8">to have us thrive in our mystery</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.iii.468 (378,5) What an alteration of honour has/Desperate want made!] [W: of humour] The original copy has,</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">What an alteration of honour has desperate want made!</span></p>
<p class="p24">The present reading is certainly better, but it has no authority. To change <span class="t8">honour</span> to <span class="t8">humour</span> is not necessary. <span class="t8">An alteration of honour</span>, is an <span class="t8">alteration</span> of an <span class="t8">honourable state</span> to a state of disgrace.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.iii.474 (378,8)</p>
<p class="p24">Grant, I may ever love, and rather woe</p>
<p class="p24">Those that would mischief me, than those that do!]</p>
<p class="p24">[W: rather too/...that woo] In defiance of this criticism, I have ventured to replace the former reading, as more suitable to the general spirit of these scenes, and as free from the absurdities charged upon it. It is plain, that in this whole speech <span class="t8">friends</span> and <span class="t8">enemies</span> are taken only for those who <span class="t8">profess friendship</span> and <span class="t8">profess enmity</span>; for the <span class="t8">friend</span> is supposed not to be more kind, but more dangerous than the <span class="t8">enemy</span>. In the amendation, <span class="t8">those that would mischief</span> are placed in opposition to <span class="t8">those that woo</span>, but in the speaker&rsquo;s intention <span class="t8">those that woo</span> are <span class="t8">those that mischief</span> most. The sense is, <span class="t8">Let me rather woo or caress those that</span> would <span class="t8">mischief, that</span> profess to mean me mischief, <span class="t8">than those</span> that really <span class="t8">do</span> me <span class="t8">mischief under false professions of kindness</span>. The Spaniards, I think, have this proverb; <span class="t8">Defend me from my friends, and from my enemies I will defend myself</span>. This proverb is a sufficient comment on the passage.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.iii.484 (379,9) all/I kept were knaves, to serve in meat to villains] <span class="t8">Knave</span> is here in the compounded sense of a <span class="t8">servant</span> and a <span class="t8">rascal</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.iii.492 (379,1) Pity&rsquo;s sleeping] I do not know that any correction is necessary, but I think we might read,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&mdash; <span class="t8">eyes do never give</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">But thorough lust and laughter, pity sleeping</span>.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Eyes never flow</span> (to <span class="t8">give</span> is to dissolve as saline bodies in moist weather) <span class="t8">but by lust</span> or <span class="t8">laughter</span>, undisturbed <span class="t8">by</span> emotions of <span class="t8">pity</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.iii.499 (380,2) It almost turns my dangerous nature wild] [W: mild] This emendation is specious, but even this may be controverted. To <span class="t8">turn wild</span> is <span class="t8">to distract</span>. An appearance so unexpected, says Timon, <span class="t8">almost turns my savageness</span> to distraction. Accordingly he examines with nicety lest his phrenzy, should deceive him,</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Let me behold thy face. Surely this man</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Was born of woman</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">And to this suspected disorder of mind he alludes,</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Perpetual, sober, Gods</span>! &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">Ye powers whose intellects are out of the reach of perturbation.</p>
<p class="p24">IV.iii.533 (381,3) thou shalt build from men] Away from human habitations.</p>
<p class="p24">V.i (382,5) <span class="t8">Enter Poet and Painter</span>] The poet and the painter were within view when Apemantus parted from Timon, and might then have seen Timon, since Apemantus, standing by him could not see them: But the scenes of the thieves and steward have passed before their arrival, and yet passed, as the drama is now conducted within their view. It might be suspected that some scenes are transposed, for all these difficulties would be removed by introducing the poet and painter first, and the thieves in this place. Yet I am afraid the scenes must keep their present order; for the painter alludes to the thieves when he says, <span class="t8">he likewise enriched poor straggling soldiers with great quantity</span>. This impropriety is now heightened by placing the thieves in one act, and the poet and painter in another: but it must be remembered, that in the original edition this play is not divided into separate acts, so that the present distribution is arbitrary, and may be changed if any convenience can be gained, or impropriety obviated by alteration.</p>
<p class="p24">V.i.47 (384,6) While the day serves, before black-corner&rsquo;d night] [W: black-cornette] <span class="t8">Black-corner&rsquo;d night</span> is probably corrupt, but <span class="t8">black-cornette</span> can hardly be right, for it should be <span class="t8">black-cornetted night</span>. I cannot propose any thing, but must leave the place in its present state. (1773)</p>
<p class="p24">V.i.101 (386,8) a made-up villain] That is a villain that adopts qualities and characters not properly belonging to him; a hypocrite.</p>

<p class="p24">But two in company &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">Each man apart, all single and alone,</p>
<p class="p24">Yet an arch villain keeps him company]</p>
<p class="p24">This passage is obscure. I think the meaning is this: <span class="t8">but two in company</span>, that is, stand apart, <span class="t8">let only two be together</span>; for even when each stands single there are two, he himself and a villain.</p>
<p class="p24">V.i.151 (388,3) Of its own fall] [The Oxford editor alters <span class="t8">fall</span> to <span class="t8">fault</span>, not knowing that Shakespeare uses <span class="t8">fall</span> to signify dishonour, not destruction. So in <span class="t8">Hamlet</span>,</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">What a</span> falling <span class="t8">off was there</span>! WARBURTON.]</p>
<p class="p24">The truth is, that neither <span class="t8">fall</span> means <span class="t8">disgrace</span>, nor is <span class="t8">fault</span> a necessary emendation. <span class="t8">Falling off</span> in the quotation is not <span class="t8">disgrace</span> but <span class="t8">defection</span>. The Athenians <span class="t8">had sense</span>, that is, felt the danger <span class="t8">of their own fall</span>, by the arms of Alcibiades.</p>
<p class="p24">V.i.151 (388,4) restraining aid to Timon] I think it should be <span class="t8">refraining aid</span>, that is, with-holding aid that should have been given <span class="t8">to</span> Timon.</p>
<p class="p24">V.i.154 (389,5) Than their offence can weigh down by the dram] This which was in the former editions can scarcely be right, and yet I know not whether my reading will be thought to rectify it. I take the meaning to be, We will give thee a recompence that our offences cannot outweigh, <span class="t8">heaps of wealth down by the dram</span>, or delivered according to the exactest measure. A little disorder may perhaps have happened in transcribing, which may be reformed by reading,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&mdash; <span class="t8">Ay, ev&rsquo;n such heaps</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">And sums of love and wealth, down by the dram,</span></p>

<p class="p24">V.iii.4 (393,2) Some beast read this; here does not live a man] [W: rear&rsquo;d] Notwithstanding this remark, I believe the old reading to be the right. <span class="t8">The soldier had only seen the rude heap of earth.</span> He had evidently seen something that told him <span class="t8">Timon was dead</span>; and what could tell that but his tomb? The tomb he sees, and the inscription upon it, which not being able to read, and finding none to read it for him, he exclaims peevishly, <span class="t8">some beast read this</span>, for it must be read, and in this place it cannot be read by man.</p>
<p class="p24">There is something elaborately unskilful in the contrivance of sending a soldier, who cannot read, to take the epitaph in wax, only that it may close the play by being read with more solemnity in the last scene.</p>
<p class="p24">V.iv.7 (394, 3) traverst arms] Arms across.</p>
<p class="p24">V.iv.8 (394,4) the time is flush] A bird is <span class="t8">flush</span> when his feathers are grown, and he can leave the nest. <span class="t8">Flush</span> is <span class="t8">mature</span>.</p>

<p class="p24">(399) General Observation. The play of <span class="t8">Timon</span> is a domestic tragedy, and therefore strongly fastens on the attention of the reader. In the plan there is not much art, but the incidents are natural, and the characters various and exact. The catastrophe affords a very powerful warning against that ostentations liberality, which scatters bounty, but confers no benefits, and buys flattery, but not friendship.</p>
<p class="p24">In this tragedy are many passages perplexed, obscure, and probably corrupt, which I have endeavoured to rectify, or explain, with due diligence; but having only one copy, cannot promise myself that my endeavours shall be much applauded.</p>
