Application architectures have evolved over this pe- riod. Today most applications use web browsers as their front end, and a database as their back end, with an application server in between.</span></p><p class="s41" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 139pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s39">• </span>HTML <span class="s40">provides the ability to deﬁne interfaces that combine hyperlinks with forms facilities. Web browsers communicate with web servers by the </span>HTTP <span class="s40">protocol. Web servers can pass on requests to application programs and return the results to the browser.</span></p><p class="s39" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 139pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: justify;">• <span class="s40">Web servers execute application programs to implement desired functionality. Servlets are a widely used mechanism to write application programs that run as part of the web server process, in order to reduce overhead. There are also many server-side scripting languages that are interpreted by the web server and provide application-program functionality as part of the web server.</span></p><p class="s39" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 139pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: justify;">• <span class="s40">There are several client-side scripting languages— JavaScript is the most widely used— that provide richer user interaction at the browser end.</span></p><p class="s40" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 139pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s39">• </span>Complex applications usually have a multilayer architecture, including a model implementing business logic, a controller, and a view mechanism to display results. They may also include a data access layer that implements an object-relational mapping. Many applications implement and use web services, allowing functions to be invoked over <span class="s41">HTTP</span>.</p><p class="s39" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 139pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: justify;">• <span class="s40">Techniques such as caching of various forms, including query result caching and connection pooling, and parallel processing are used to improve application per- formance.</span></p><p class="s40" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 139pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s39">• </span>Application developers must pay careful attention to security, to prevent attacks such as <span class="s41">SQL </span>injection attacks and cross-site scripting attacks.</p><p class="s39" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 139pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: justify;">• <span class="s41">SQL </span><span class="s40">authorization mechanisms are coarse grained and of limited value to appli- cations that deal with large numbers of users. Today application programs imple- ment ﬁne-grained, tuple-level authorization, dealing with a large number of ap- plication users, completely outside the database system. Database extensions to provide tuple-level access control and to deal with large numbers of application users have been developed, but are not standard as yet.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s39" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 107pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: justify;">• <span class="s40">Protecting the privacy of data are an important task for database applications. Many countries have legal requirements on protection of certain kinds of data, such as credit-card information or medical data.</span></p><p class="s39" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 107pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: justify;">• <span class="s40">Encryption plays a key role in protecting information and in authentication of users and web sites. Symmetric-key encryption and public-key encryption are two contrasting but widely used approaches to encryption. Encryption of certain sen- sitive data stored in databases is a legal requirement in many countries and states.</span></p><p class="s39" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 107pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: justify;">• <span class="s40">Encryption also plays a key role in authentication of users to applications, of Web sites to users, and for digital signatures.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part191.htm">&lt; 上一个</a><span> | </span><a href="../database.html">内容</a><span> | </span><a href="part193.htm">下一个 &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
