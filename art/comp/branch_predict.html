		<h2>Branch predictions</h2>
		<h3>Reduce delay</h3>
		<p>We want CPU to do the <b>Instruction Decode</b>
		and  <b>calculation of PC</b> and <b>Execute the answer</b> at stage ID</p>
		<h3>Make prediction</h3>
		<p>
		<ol>
			<li>Static predict</li>
			<li>Dynamic predict</li>
		</ol>
		The latter is very important. It have many way to do the predict. You shall check some references.
		</p>

		<h2>Exceptions</h2>
		<p>
		Exceptions occur when, for example, you get an unknown instruction. CPU needs to deal with it.
		How? Use the SEPC (<em>Supervisor Exceptions Program Counter</em>) and SCAUSE (<em>supervise cause</em>).
		</p>
		<p>
		SEPC store the value of PC when exceptions happen. SCAUSE store the type of an exception when it happens.
		</p>
		<p>Moreover, we want to rewind the state. So it is important that we don't reach WB stage. To do
		that we use an additional signal called EX.Flush.
		That is to say, if an instruction reach WB stage, the result of the instruction is written
		to memory or register, then we can't easily rewind, for we shall use another register to copy the
		value of the old one.</p>
