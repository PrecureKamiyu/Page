<h2 class="h20"><a id="a1543"></a>HAMMOND.</h2>
<p class="p21">Of Mr. Hammond, though he be well remembered as a man esteemed and caressed by the elegant and great, I was at first able to obtain no other memorials than such as are supplied by a book called Cibber&rsquo;s Lives of the Poets; of which I take this opportunity to testify that it was not written, nor, I believe, ever seen by either of the Cibbers; but was the work of Robert Shiels, a native of Scotland, a man of very acute understanding, though with little scholastick education, who, not long after the publication of his work, died in London of a consumption. His life was virtuous, and his end was pious. Theophilus Cibber, then a prisoner for debt, imparted, as I was told, his name for ten guineas. The manuscript of Shiels is now in my possession.</p>
<p class="p24">I have since found that Mr. Shiels, though he was no negligent inquirer, has been misled by false accounts; for he relates that James Hammond, the author of the elegies, was the son of a Turkey merchant, and had some office at the prince of Wales&rsquo;s court, till love of a lady, whose name was Dashwood, for a time disordered his understanding. He was unextinguishably amorous, and his mistress inexorably cruel.</p>
<p class="p24"><a id="a1544"></a><a id="a1545"></a>Of this narrative, part is true, and part false. He was the second son of Anthony Hammond, a man of note among the wits, poets, and parliamentary orators, in the beginning of this century, who was allied to sir Robert Walpole by marrying his sister. He was born about 1710, and educated at Westminster-school; but it does not appear that he was of any university. He was equerry to the prince of Wales, and seems to have come very early into publick notice, and to have been distinguished by those whose friendship prejudiced mankind at that time in favour of the man on whom they were bestowed; for he was the companion of Cobham, Lyttelton, and Chesterfield. He is said to have divided his life between pleasure and books; in his retirement forgetting the town, and in his gaiety losing the student. Of his literary hours all the effects are here exhibited, of which the elegies were written very early, and the prologue not long before his death.</p>
<p class="p24">In 1741, he was chosen into parliament for Truro, in Cornwall, probably one of those who were elected by the prince&rsquo;s influence; and died next year in June, at Stowe, the famous seat of lord Cobham. His mistress long outlived him, and, in 1779, died unmarried. The character which her lover bequeathed her was, indeed, not likely to attract courtship.</p>
<p class="p24">The elegies were published after his death; and while the writer&rsquo;s name was remembered with fondness, they were read with a resolution to admire them.</p>
<p class="p24">The recommendatory preface of the editor, who was then believed, and is now affirmed by Dr. Maty, to be the earl of Chesterfield, raised strong prejudices in their favour.</p>
<p class="p24">But of the prefacer, whoever he was, it may be reasonably suspected that he never read the poems; for he professes to value them for a very high species of excellence, and recommends them as the genuine effusions of the mind, which expresses a real passion in the language of nature. But the truth is, these elegies have neither passion, nature, nor manners. Where there is fiction, there is no passion: he that describes himself as a shepherd, and his Ne√¶ra or Delia as a shepherdess, and talks of goats and lambs, feels no passion. He that courts his mistress with Roman imagery deserves to lose her; for she may, with good reason, suspect his sincerity. Hammond has few sentiments drawn from nature, and few images from modern life. He produces nothing but frigid pedantry. It would be hard to find in all his productions three stanzas that deserve to be remembered.</p>
<p class="p24">Like other lovers, he threatens the lady with dying; and what then shall follow?</p>
<p class="p26">Wilt thou in tears thy lover&rsquo;s corse attend;<br/>With eyes averted light the solemn pyre,<br/>Till all around the doleful flames ascend,<br/>Then, slowly sinking, by degrees expire?</p>
<p class="p26">To sooth the hov&rsquo;ring soul be thine the care,<br/>With plaintive cries to lead the mournful band;<br/>In sable weeds the golden vase to bear,<br/>And cull my ashes with thy trembling hand:</p>
<p class="p26">Panchaia&rsquo;s odours be their costly feast,<br/>And all the pride of Asia&rsquo;s fragrant year,<br/>Give them the treasures of the farthest East,<br/>And, what is still more precious, give thy tear.</p>
<p class="p24">Surely no blame can fall upon the nymph who rejected a swain of so little meaning.</p>
<p class="p24"><a id="a1546"></a>His verses are not rugged, but they have no sweetness; they never glide in a stream of melody. Why Hammond or other writers have thought the quatrain of ten syllables elegiack, it is difficult to tell. The character of the elegy is gentleness and tenuity; but this stanza has been pronounced by Dryden, whose knowledge of English metre was not inconsiderable, to be the most magnificent of all the measures which our language affords.</p>
