In computing terms, UNIX
            has a long history. The first part of this chapter provides a brief outline of that
            history. We begin with a description of the origins of the UNIX system and the C
            programming language, and then consider the two key currents that led to the Linux
            system as it exists today: the GNU project and the development of the Linux
                kernel.<a id="IDX-CHP-1-0001" class="indexterm"/></p><p>One of the notable features of the UNIX system is that its development was not
            controlled by a single vendor or organization. Rather, many groups, both commercial and
            noncommercial, contributed to its evolution. This history resulted in many innovative
            features being added to UNIX, but also had the negative consequence that UNIX
            implementations diverged over time, so that writing applications that worked on all UNIX
            implementations became increasingly difficult. This led to a drive for standardization
            of UNIX implementations, which we discuss in the second part of this chapter.</p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>Two definitions of the term UNIX are in common use. One of these denotes operating
                systems that have passed the official conformance tests for the Single UNIX
                Specification and thus are officially granted the right to be branded as “UNIX” by
                The Open Group (the holders of the UNIX trademark). At the time of writing, none of
                the free UNIX implementations (e.g., Linux and FreeBSD) has obtained this
                branding.</p><p>The other common meaning attached to the term UNIX denotes those systems that look
                and behave like classical UNIX systems (i.e., the original Bell Laboratories UNIX
                and its later principal offshoots, System V and BSD). By this definition, Linux is
                generally considered to be a UNIX system (as are the modern BSDs). Although we give
                close attention to the Single UNIX Specification in this book, we’ll follow this
                second definition of UNIX, so that we’ll often say things such as “Linux, like other
                UNIX implementations. . . .”<a id="IDX-CHP-1-0002" class="indexterm"/></p></div><div class="sect1" title="A Brief History of UNIX and C"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both" id="a_brief_history_of_unix_and_c">A Brief History of UNIX and C</h2></div></div></div><p>The first UNIX implementation was developed in 1969 (the same year that Linus
                Torvalds was born) by Ken Thompson at Bell Laboratories, a division of the telephone
                corporation, AT&amp;T. It was written in assembler for a Digital PDP-7
                minicomputer. The name UNIX was a pun on MULTICS (<span class="emphasis"><em>Multiplexed Information
                    and Computing Service</em></span>), the name of an earlier operating system
                project in which AT&amp;T collaborated with Massachusetts Institute of
                Technology (MIT) and General Electric. (AT&amp;T had by this time withdrawn from
                the project in frustration at its initial failure to develop an economically useful
                system.) Thompson drew several ideas for his new operating system from MULTICS,
                including a tree-structured file system, a separate program for interpreting
                commands (the shell), and the notion of files as unstructured streams of
                    bytes.<a id="IDX-CHP-1-0003" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-1-0004" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-1-0005" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-1-0006" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-1-0007" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-1-0008" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-1-0009" class="indexterm"/></p><p>In 1970, UNIX was rewritten in assembly language for a newly acquired Digital
                PDP-11 minicomputer, then a new and powerful machine. Vestiges of this PDP-11
                heritage can be found in various names still used on most UNIX implementations,
                including Linux.<a id="IDX-CHP-1-0010" class="indexterm"/></p><p>A short time later, Dennis Ritchie, one of Thompson’s colleagues at Bell
                Laboratories and an early collaborator on UNIX, designed and implemented the C
                programming language. This was an evolutionary process; C followed an earlier
                interpreted language, B. B was initially implemented by Thompson and drew many of
                its ideas from a still earlier programming language named BCPL. By 1973, C had
                matured to a point where the UNIX kernel could be almost entirely rewritten in the
                new language. UNIX thus became one of the earliest operating systems to be written
                in a high-level language, a fact that made subsequent porting to other hardware
                architectures possible.<a id="IDX-CHP-1-0011" class="indexterm"/></p><p>The genesis of C explains why it, and its descendant C++, have come to be used so
                widely as system programming languages today. Previous widely used languages were
                designed with other purposes in mind: FORTRAN for mathematical tasks performed by
                engineers and scientists; COBOL for commercial systems processing streams of
                record-oriented data. C filled a hitherto empty niche, and unlike FORTRAN and COBOL
                (which were designed by large committees), the design of C arose from the ideas and
                needs of a few individuals working toward a single goal: developing a high-level
                language for implementing the UNIX kernel and associated software. Like the UNIX
                operating system itself, C was designed by professional programmers for their own
                use. The resulting language was small, efficient, powerful, terse, modular,
                pragmatic, and coherent in its design.</p><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="unix_first_through_sixth_editions"/></div></div></div><div class="sect3" title="UNIX First through Sixth editions"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title" id="unix_first_through_sixth_editions-id1">UNIX First through Sixth editions</h4></div></div></div><p>Between 1969 and 1979, UNIX went through a number of releases, known as

                        snapshots of the evolving development version at AT&amp;T. [Salus, 1994]

                        spread, first within AT&amp;T, and then beyond. An important
                        contribution to this growing awareness was the publication of a paper on
                        UNIX in the widely read journal <span class="emphasis"><em>Communications of the
                            ACM</em></span> ([Ritchie &amp; Thompson, 1974]).</p><p>At this time, AT&amp;T held a government-sanctioned monopoly on the US
                        telephone system. The terms of AT&amp;T’s agreement with the US
                        government prevented it from selling software, which meant that it could not
                        sell UNIX as a product. Instead, beginning in 1974 with Fifth Edition, and
                        especially with Sixth Edition, AT&amp;T licensed UNIX for use in
                        universities for a nominal distribution fee. The university distributions
                        included documentation and the kernel source code (about 10,000 lines at the
                        time).</p><p>AT&amp;T’s release of UNIX into universities greatly contributed to
                        the popularity and use of the operating system, and by 1977, UNIX was
                        running at some 500 sites, including 125 universities in the United States
                        and several other countries. UNIX offered universities an interactive
                        multiuser operating system that was cheap yet powerful, at a time when
                        commercial operating systems were very expensive. It also gave university
                        computer science departments the source code of a real operating system,
                        which they could modify and offer to their students to learn from and
                        experiment with. Some of these students, armed with UNIX knowledge, became
                        UNIX evangelists. Others went on to found or join the multitude of startup
                        companies selling inexpensive computer workstations running the easily
                        ported UNIX operating system.</p></div><div class="sect3" title="The birth of BSD and System V"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title" id="the_birth_of_bsd_and_system_v">The birth of BSD and System V</h4></div></div></div><p>January 1979 saw the release of Seventh Edition UNIX, which improved the
                        reliability of the system and provided an enhanced file system. This release
                        also contained a number of new tools, including <span class="emphasis"><em>awk</em></span>,
                            <span class="emphasis"><em>make</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>sed</em></span>,

                        and a FORTRAN 77 compiler. The release of Seventh Edition is also
                        significant because, from this point, UNIX diverged into two important
                        variants: BSD and System V, whose origins we now briefly describe.<a id="IDX-CHP-1-0014" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-1-0015" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-1-0016" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-1-0017" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-1-0018" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-1-0019" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-1-0020" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-1-0021" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-1-0022" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-1-0023" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-1-0024" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-1-0025" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-1-0026" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-1-0027" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-1-0028" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-1-0029" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Thompson spent the 1975/1976 academic year as a visiting professor at the
                        University of California at Berkeley, the university from which he had
                        graduated. There, he worked with several graduate students, adding many new
                        features to UNIX. (One of these students, Bill Joy, subsequently went on to
                        cofound Sun Microsystems, an early entry in the UNIX workstation market.)
                        Over time, many new tools and features were developed at Berkeley, including
                        the <span class="emphasis"><em>C shell</em></span>, the <span class="emphasis"><em>vi</em></span> editor, an
                        improved file system (the <span class="emphasis"><em>Berkeley Fast File System</em></span>),
                            <span class="emphasis"><em>sendmail</em></span>, a Pascal compiler, and virtual memory
                        management on the new Digital VAX architecture.<a id="IDX-CHP-1-0030" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Under the name Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD), this version of UNIX,
                        including its source code, came to be widely distributed. The first full
                        distribution was 3BSD in December 1979. (Earlier releases from Berkeley–BSD
                        and 2BSD–were distributions of new tools produced at Berkeley, rather than
                        complete UNIX distributions.)<a id="IDX-CHP-1-0031" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-1-0032" class="indexterm"/></p><p>In 1983, the <span class="emphasis"><em>Computer Systems Research Group</em></span> at the
                        University of California at Berkeley released 4.2BSD. This release was
                        significant because it contained a complete TCP/IP implementation, including
                        the sockets application programming interface (API) and a variety of
                        networking tools. 4.2BSD and its predecessor 4.1BSD became widely
                        distributed within universities around the world. They also formed the basis
                        for SunOS (first released in 1983), the UNIX variant sold by Sun. Other
                        significant BSD releases were 4.3BSD, in 1986, and the final release,
                        4.4BSD, in 1993.<a id="IDX-CHP-1-0033" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-1-0034" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-1-0035" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-1-0036" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>The very first ports of the UNIX system to hardware other than the
                            PDP-11 occurred during 1977 and 1978, when Dennis Ritchie and Steve
                            Johnson ported it to the Interdata 8/32 and Richard Miller at the
                            University of Wollongong in Australia simultaneously ported it to the
                            Interdata 7/32. The Berkeley Digital VAX port was based on an earlier
                            (1978) port by John Reiser and Tom London. Known as 32V, this port was
                            essentially the same as Seventh Edition for the PDP-11, except for the
                            larger address space and wider data types.</p></div><p>In the meantime, US antitrust legislation forced the breakup of
                        AT&amp;T (legal maneuvers began in the mid-1970s, and the breakup became
                        effective in 1982), with the consequence that, since it no longer held a
                        monopoly on the telephone system, the company was permitted to market UNIX.
                        This resulted in the release of System III (three) in 1981. System III was
                        produced by AT&amp;T’s UNIX Support Group (USG), which employed many
                        hundreds of developers to enhance UNIX and develop UNIX applications
                        (notably, document preparation packages and software development tools). The
                        first release of System V (five) followed in 1983, and a series of releases
                        led to the definitive System V Release 4 (SVR4) in 1989, by which time
                        System V had incorporated many features from BSD, including networking
                        facilities. System V was licensed to a variety of commercial vendors, who
                        used it as the basis of their UNIX implementations.<a id="IDX-CHP-1-0037" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Thus, in addition to the various BSD distributions spreading through
                        academia, by the late 1980s, UNIX was available in a range of commercial
                        implementations on various hardware. These implementations included Sun’s
                        SunOS and later Solaris, Digital’s Ultrix and OSF/1 (nowadays, after a
                        series of renamings and acquisitions, HP Tru64 UNIX), IBM’s AIX,
                        Hewlett-Packard’s (HP’s) HP-UX, NeXT’s NeXTStep, A/UX for the Apple
                        Macintosh, and Microsoft and SCO’s XENIX for the Intel x86-32 architecture.
                        (Throughout this book, the Linux implementation for x86-32 is referred to as
                        Linux/x86-32.) This situation was in sharp contrast to the typical
                        proprietary hardware/operating system scenarios of the time, where each
                        vendor produced one, or at most a few, proprietary computer chip
                        architectures, on which they sold their own proprietary operating system(s).
                        The proprietary nature of most vendor systems meant that purchasers were
                        locked into one vendor. Switching to another proprietary operating system
                        and hardware platform could become very expensive because of the need to
                        port existing applications and retrain staff. This factor, coupled with the

                something of a misnomer, since many of the key components contained within a typical
                commercial Linux distribution actually originate from a project that predates the

                    working at MIT, set to work on creating a “free” UNIX implementation. Stallman’s
                    outlook was a moral one, and <span class="emphasis"><em>free</em></span> was defined in a legal
                    sense, rather than a financial sense (see <a class="ulink" href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html" target="_top">http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html</a>). Nevertheless, the legal
                    freedom that Stallman described carried with it the implicit consequence that
                    software such as operating systems would be available at no or very low
                    cost.</p><p>Stallman militated against the legal restrictions placed on proprietary
                    operating systems by computer vendors. These restrictions meant that purchasers
                    of computer software in general could not see the source code of the software
                    they were buying, and they certainly could not copy, change, or redistribute it.
                    He pointed out that such a framework encouraged programmers to compete with each
                    other and hoard their work, rather than to cooperate and share it.</p><p>In response, Stallman started the GNU project (a recursively defined acronym
                    for “GNU’s not UNIX”) to develop an entire, freely available, UNIX-like system,
                    consisting of a kernel and all associated software packages, and encouraged
                    others to join him. In 1985, Stallman founded the Free Software Foundation
                    (FSF), a nonprofit organization to support the GNU project as well as the
                    development of free software in general.<a id="IDX-CHP-1-0052" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-1-0053" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>When the GNU project was started, BSD was not free in the sense that
                        Stallman meant. Use of BSD still required a license from AT&amp;T, and
                        users could not freely modify and redistribute the AT&amp;T code that
                        formed part of BSD.</p></div><p>One of the important results of the GNU project was the development of the GNU
                        <span class="emphasis"><em>General Public License</em></span> (GPL), the legal embodiment of
                    Stallman’s notion of free software. Much of the software in a Linux
                    distribution, including the kernel, is licensed under the GPL or one of a number
                    of similar licenses. Software licensed under the GPL must be made available in
                    source code form, and must be freely redistributable under the terms of the GPL.
                    Modifications to GPL-licensed software are freely permitted, but any
                    distribution of such modified software must also be under the terms of the GPL.
                    If the modified software is distributed in executable form, the author must also
                    allow any recipients the option of obtaining the modified source for no more
                    than the cost of distribution. The first version of the GPL was released in
                    1989. The current version of the license, version 3, was released in 2007.
                    Version 2 of the license, released in 1991, remains in wide use, and is the
                    license used for the Linux kernel. (Discussions of various free software
                    licenses can be found in [St. Laurent, 2004] and [Rosen, 2005].)<a id="IDX-CHP-1-0054" class="indexterm"/></p><p>The GNU project did not initially produce a working UNIX kernel, but did
                    produce a wide range of other programs. Since these programs were designed to
                    run on a UNIX-like operating system, they could be, and were, used on existing
                    UNIX implementations and, in some cases, even ported to other operating systems.
                    Among the more well-known programs produced by the GNU project are the

                    and <span class="emphasis"><em>glibc</em></span> (the GNU C library).</p><p>By the early 1990s, the GNU project had produced a system that was virtually
                    complete, except for one important component: a working UNIX kernel. The GNU
                    project had started work on an ambitious kernel design, known as the GNU/HURD,
                    based on the Mach microkernel. However, the HURD was far from being in a form
                    that could be released. (At the time of writing, work continues on the HURD,
                    which currently runs only on the x86-32 architecture.)<a id="IDX-CHP-1-0055" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-1-0056" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>Because a significant part of the program code that constitutes what is

                    inspired to write an operating system for his Intel 80386 PC. In the course of
                    his studies, Torvalds had come into contact with Minix, a small UNIX-like
                    operating system kernel developed in the mid-1980s by Andrew Tanenbaum, a
                    university professor in Holland. Tanenbaum made Minix, complete with source
                    code, available as a tool for teaching operating system design in university
                    courses. The Minix kernel could be built and run on a 386 system. However, since
                    its primary purpose was as a teaching tool, it was designed to be largely
                    independent of the hardware architecture, and it did not take full advantage of
                    the 386 processor’s capabilities.<a id="IDX-CHP-1-0058" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-1-0059" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-1-0060" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-1-0061" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-1-0062" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-1-0063" class="indexterm"/></p><p>Torvalds therefore started on a project to create an efficient, full-featured
                    UNIX kernel to run on the 386. Over a few months, Torvalds developed a basic
                    kernel that allowed him to compile and run various GNU programs. Then, on
                    October 5, 1991, Torvalds requested the help of other programmers, making the

                    Initially, Linux was placed under a more restrictive license, but Torvalds soon

                    1994, the developers were able to release version 1.0. Linux 1.2 appeared in
                    March 1995, Linux 2.0 in June 1996, Linux 2.2 in January 1999, and Linux 2.4 in
                    January 2001. Work on the 2.5 development kernel began in November 2001, and led

                        x86-32 during the early 1990s. Bill and Lynne Jolitz had developed a port of
                        the already mature BSD system for the x86-32, known as 386/BSD. This port
                        was based on the BSD Net/2 release (June 1991), a version of the 4.3BSD
                        source code in which all remaining proprietary AT&amp;T source code had
                        either been replaced or, in the case of six source code files that could not
                        be trivially rewritten, removed. The Jolitzes ported the Net/2 code to
                        x86-32, rewrote the missing source files, and made the first release
                        (version 0.0) of 386/BSD in February 1992.<a id="IDX-CHP-1-0064" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-1-0065" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-1-0066" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-1-0067" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-1-0068" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-1-0069" class="indexterm"/></p><p>After an initial wave of success and popularity, work on 386/BSD lagged
                        for various reasons. In the face of an increasingly large backlog of
                        patches, two alternative development groups soon appeared, creating their
                        own releases based on 386/BSD: NetBSD, which emphasizes portability to a
                        wide range of hardware platforms, and FreeBSD, which emphasizes performance
                        and is the most widespread of the modern BSDs. The first NetBSD release was
                        0.8, in April 1993. The first FreeBSD CD-ROM (version 1.0) appeared in
                        December 1993. Another BSD, OpenBSD, appeared in 1996 (as an initial version
                        numbered 2.0) after forking from the NetBSD project. OpenBSD emphasizes
                        security. In mid-2003, a new BSD, DragonFly BSD, appeared after a split from

                        mention of the lawsuits between UNIX System Laboratories (USL, the
                        AT&amp;T subsidiary spun off to develop and market UNIX) and Berkeley.
                        In early 1992, the company Berkeley Software Design, Incorporated (BSDi,
                        nowadays part of Wind River) began distributing a commercially supported BSD
                        UNIX, BSD/OS, based on the Net/2 release and the Jolitzes’ 386/BSD
                        additions. BSDi distributed binaries and source code for $995 (US dollars),
                        and advised potential customers to use their telephone number
                            1-800-ITS-UNIX.<a id="IDX-CHP-1-0074" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-1-0075" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-1-0076" class="indexterm"/></p><p>In April 1992, USL filed suit against BSDi in an attempt to prevent BSDi
                        from selling a product that USL claimed was still encumbered by proprietary
                        USL source code and trade secrets. USL also demanded that BSDi cease using
                        the deceptive telephone number. The suit was eventually widened to include a
                        claim against the University of California. The court ultimately dismissed
                        all but two of USL’s claims, and a countersuit by the University of
                        California against USL ensued, in which the university claimed that USL had
                        not given due credit for the use of BSD code in System V.</p><p>While these suits were pending, USL was acquired by Novell, whose CEO, the
                        late Ray Noorda, stated publicly that he would prefer to compete in the
                        marketplace rather than in the court. Settlement was finally reached in
                        January 1994, with the University of California being required to remove 3
                        of the 18,000 files in the Net/2 release, make some minor changes to a few
                        other files, and add USL copyright notices to around 70 other files, which
                        the university nevertheless could continue to distribute freely. This
                        modified system was released as 4.4BSD-Lite in June 1994. (The last release
                        from the university was 4.4BSD-Lite, Release 2 in June 1995.) At this point,
                        the terms of the legal settlement required BSDi, FreeBSD, and NetBSD to
                        replace their Net/2 base with the modified 4.4BSD-Lite source code. As
                        [McKusick et al., 1996] notes, although this caused some delay in the
                        development of the BSD derivatives, it also had the positive effect that
                        these systems resynchronized with the three years of development work done
                        by the university’s Computer Systems Research Group since the release of

                        release-often model, so that new kernel revisions appear frequently
                        (sometimes even daily). As the Linux user base increased, the release model
                        was adapted to decrease disruption to existing users. Specifically,
                        following the release of Linux 1.0, the kernel developers adopted a kernel
                        version numbering scheme with each release numbered

                        had an even minor version number, and a more volatile

                        odd minor version number. The theory–not always followed strictly in
                        practice–was that all new features should be added in the current
                        development kernel series, while new revisions in the stable kernel series
                        should be restricted to minor improvements and bug fixes. When the current
                        development branch was deemed suitable for release, it became the new stable

                        by the long intervals between stable kernel releases. (Nearly three years
                        passed between the release of Linux 2.4.0 and 2.6.0.) There have
                        periodically been discussions about fine-tuning this model, but the

                            <span class="emphasis"><em>Linux</em></span> is commonly used to mean the kernel, plus a
                        wide range of other software (tools and libraries) that together make a
                        complete operating system. In the very early days of Linux, the user was
                        required to assemble all of this software, create a file system, and
                        correctly place and configure all of the software on that file system. This
                        demanded considerable time and expertise. As a result, a market opened for
                        Linux distributors, who created packages
                        (<span class="emphasis"><em>distributions</em></span>) to automate most of the installation
                        process, creating a file system and installing the kernel and other required

                drawbacks. Some UNIX implementations were based on BSD, others were based on System
                V, and some drew features from both variants. Furthermore, each commercial vendor
                had added extra features to its own implementation. The consequence was that moving
                software and people from one UNIX implementation to another became steadily more
                difficult. This situation created strong pressure for standardization of the C
                programming language and the UNIX system, so that applications could more easily be
                ported from one system to another.

                    on a wide variety of UNIX systems and on other operating systems. Minor
                    differences had arisen between the various implementations, in part because
                    certain aspects of how the language should function were not detailed in the
                    existing de facto standard for C, Kernighan and Ritchie’s 1978 book,
                        <span class="emphasis"><em>The C Programming Language</em></span>. (The older C syntax
                    described in that book is sometimes called <span class="emphasis"><em>traditional C</em></span> or
                        <span class="emphasis"><em>K&amp;R C</em></span>.) Furthermore, the appearance of C++ in
                    1985 highlighted certain improvements and additions that could be made to C
                    without breaking existing programs, notably function prototypes, structure
                    assignment, type qualifiers (<span class="emphasis"><em>const</em></span> and
                        <span class="emphasis"><em>volatile</em></span>), enumeration types, and the

                    with the approval of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) C standard
                    (X3.159-1989), which was subsequently adopted in 1990 as an International
                    Standards Organization (ISO) standard (ISO/IEC 9899:1990). As well as defining
                    the syntax and semantics of C, this standard described the operation of the
                    standard C library, which includes the <span class="emphasis"><em>stdio</em></span> functions,
                    string-handling functions, math functions, various header files, and so on. This

                    standard is usually referred to as C99, and includes a range of changes to the
                    language and its standard library. These changes include the addition of

                        of its computer systems. In 1989, FIPS 151-1 was published. This standard
                        was based on the 1988 IEEE POSIX.1 standard and the draft ANSI C standard.
                        The main difference between FIPS 151-1 and POSIX.1 (1988) was that the FIPS
                        standard required some features that POSIX.1 left as optional. Because the
                        US government is a major purchaser of computer systems, most computer
                        vendors ensured that their UNIX systems conformed to the FIPS 151-1 version
                        of POSIX.1.<a id="IDX-CHP-1-0120" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-1-0121" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-1-0122" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-1-0123" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-1-0124" class="indexterm"/></p><p>FIPS 151-2 aligned with the 1990 ISO edition of POSIX.1, but was otherwise

Standardization
                    efforts in this area began in the late 1980s with the formation of the POSIX
                    1003.12 committee to standardize the sockets API, the X/Open Transport Interface
                    (XTI) API (an alternative network programming API based on System V’s Transport
                    Layer Interface), and various associated APIs. The gestation of this standard
                    occurred over several years, during which time POSIX 1003.12 was renamed POSIX
                    1003.1g. It was ratified in 2000.<a id="IDX-CHP-1-0187" class="indexterm"/></p><p>In parallel with the development of POSIX 1003.1g, X/Open was also developing
                    its X/Open Networking Specification (XNS). The first version of this
                    specification, XNS Issue 4, was part of the first version of the Single UNIX
                    Specification. It was succeeded by XNS Issue 5, which formed part of SUSv2. XNS
                    Issue 5 was essentially the same as the then current (6.6) draft of POSIX.1g.
                    This was followed by XNS Issue 5.2, which differed from XNS Issue 5 and the
                    ratified POSIX.1g standard in marking the XTI API as obsolete and in including
                    coverage of Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6), which was being designed in the
                    mid-1990s. XNS Issue 5.2 formed the basis for the networking material included
                    in SUSv3, and is thus now superseded. For similar reasons, POSIX.1g was
                    withdrawn as a standard soon after it was ratified.<a id="IDX-CHP-1-0188" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-1-0189" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="figure"><a id="relationships_between_various_unix_and_c"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="I_mediaobject1_d1e2156"/><img src="figs/web/01-1_HIST-standards-timeline.png.jpg" alt="Relationships between various UNIX and C standards"/></div></div><div class="figure-title">Figure 1-1. Relationships between various UNIX and C standards</div></div></div><div class="sect2" title="Implementation Standards"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="implementation_standards">Implementation Standards</h3></div></div></div><p>In addition to the standards produced by independent or multiparty groups,

                    final BSD release (4.4BSD) and AT&amp;T’s System V Release 4 (SVR4). The
                    latter implementation standard was formalized by AT&amp;T’s publication of
                    the System V Interface Definition (SVID). In 1989, AT&amp;T published Issue
                    3 of the SVID, which defined the interface that a UNIX implementation must
                    provide in order to be able to call itself System V Release 4. (The SVID is

                    development aims to conform to the various UNIX standards, especially POSIX and
                    the Single UNIX Specification. However, at the time of writing, no Linux
                    distributions are branded as “UNIX” by The Open Group. The problems are time and
                    expense. Each vendor distribution would need to undergo conformance testing to
                    obtain this branding, and it would need to repeat this testing with each new
                    distribution release. Nevertheless, it is the de facto near-conformance to
                    various standards that has enabled Linux to be so successful in the UNIX
                        market.<a id="IDX-CHP-1-0221" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-1-0222" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-1-0223" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-1-0224" class="indexterm"/></p><p>With most commercial UNIX implementations, the same company both develops and
                    distributes the operating system. With Linux, things are different, in that
                    implementation is separate from distribution, and multiple organizations–both
                    commercial and noncommercial–handle Linux distribution.</p><p>Linus Torvalds doesn’t contribute to or endorse a particular Linux
                    distribution. However, in terms of other individuals carrying out Linux
                    development, the situation is more complex. Many developers working on the Linux
                    kernel and on other free software projects are employed by various Linux
                    distribution companies or work for companies (such as IBM and HP) with a strong
                    interest in Linux. While these companies can influence the direction in which
                    Linux moves by allocating programmer hours to certain projects, none of them
                    controls Linux as such. And, of course, many of the other contributors to the
                    Linux kernel and GNU projects work voluntarily.</p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>At the time of writing, Torvalds is employed as a fellow at the Linux
                        Foundation (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.linux-foundation.org/" target="_top">http://www.linux-foundation.org/</a>; formerly the
                        Open Source Development Laboratory, OSDL), a nonprofit consortium of
                        commercial and noncommercial organizations chartered to foster the growth of
                            Linux.<a id="IDX-CHP-1-0225" class="indexterm"/></p></div><p>Because there are multiple Linux distributors and because the kernel
                    implementers don’t control the contents of distributions, there is no “standard”
                    commercial Linux as such. Each Linux distributor’s kernel offering is typically
                    based on a snapshot of the mainline (i.e., the Torvalds) kernel at a particular
                    point in time, with a number of patches applied.</p><p>These patches typically provide features that, to a greater or lesser extent,
                    are deemed commercially desirable, and thus able to provide competitive
                    differentiation in the marketplace. In some cases, these patches are later
                    accepted into the mainline kernel. In fact, some new kernel features were
                    initially developed by a distribution company, and appeared in their
                    distribution before eventually being integrated into the mainline. For example,
                    version 3 of the <span class="emphasis"><em>Reiserfs</em></span> journaling file system was part
                    of some Linux distributions long before it was accepted into the mainline 2.4
                    kernel.</p><p>The upshot of the preceding points is that there are (mostly minor)
                    differences in the systems offered by the various Linux distribution companies.
                    On a much smaller scale, this is reminiscent of the splits in implementations
                    that occurred in the early years of UNIX. The Linux Standard Base (LSB) is an
                    effort to ensure compatibility among the various Linux distributions. To do
                    this, the LSB (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.linux-foundation.org/en/LSB" target="_top">http://www.linux-foundation.org/en/LSB</a>) develops
                    and promotes a set of standards for Linux systems with the aim of ensuring that
                    binary applications (i.e., compiled programs) can run on any LSB-conformant
                        system.<a id="IDX-CHP-1-0226" class="indexterm"/></p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>The binary portability promoted by the LSB contrasts with the source code
                        portability promoted by POSIX. Source code portability means that we can
                        write a C program and then successfully compile and run it on any
                        POSIX-conformant system. Binary compatibility is much more demanding and is
                        generally not feasible across different hardware platforms. It allows us to
                        compile a program once for a given hardware platform, and then run that
                        compiled program on any conformant implementation running on that hardware
                        platform. Binary portability is an essential requirement for the commercial
                        viability of independent software vendor (ISV) applications built for
                        Linux.</p></div></div></div><div class="sect1" title="Summary"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both" id="summary">Summary</h2></div></div></div><p>The UNIX system was first implemented in 1969 on a Digital PDP-7 minicomputer by
                Ken Thompson at Bell Laboratories (part of AT&amp;T). The operating system drew
                many ideas, as well as its punned name, from the earlier MULTICS system. By 1973,
                UNIX had been moved to the PDP-11 mini-computer and rewritten in C, a programming
                language designed and implemented at Bell Laboratories by Dennis Ritchie. Legally
                prevented from selling UNIX, AT&amp;T instead distributed the complete system to
                universities for a nominal charge. This distribution included source code, and
                became very popular within universities, since it provided a cheap operating system
                whose code could be studied and modified by computer science academics and
                    students.<a id="IDX-CHP-1-0227" class="indexterm"/><a id="IDX-CHP-1-0228" class="indexterm"/></p><p>The University of California at Berkeley played a key role in the development of
                the UNIX system. There, Ken Thompson and a number of graduate students extended the
                operating system. By 1979, the University was producing its own UNIX distribution,
                BSD. This distribution became widespread in academia and formed the basis for
                several commercial implementations.</p><p>Meanwhile, the breakup of the AT&amp;T monopoly permitted the company to sell
                the UNIX system. This resulted in the other major variant of UNIX, System V, which
                also formed the basis for several commercial implementations.</p><p>Two different currents led to the development of (GNU/) Linux. One of these was
                the GNU project, founded by Richard Stallman. By the late 1980s, the GNU project had
                produced an almost complete, freely distributable UNIX implementation. The one part
                lacking was a working kernel. In 1991, inspired by the Minix kernel written by
                Andrew Tanenbaum, Linus Torvalds produced a working UNIX kernel for the Intel x86-32
                architecture. Torvalds invited other programmers to join him in improving the
                kernel. Many programmers did so, and, over time, Linux was extended and ported to a
                wide variety of hardware architectures.</p><p>The portability problems that arose from the variations in UNIX and C
                implementations that existed by the late 1980s created a strong pressure for
                standardization. The C language was standardized in 1989 (C89), and a revised
                standard was produced in 1999 (C99). The first attempt to standardize the operating
                system interface yielded POSIX.1, ratified as an IEEE standard in 1988, and as an
                ISO standard in 1990. During the 1990s, further standards were drafted, including
                various versions of the Single UNIX Specification. In 2001, the combined POSIX
                1003.1-2001 and SUSv3 standard was ratified. This standard consolidates and extends
                various earlier POSIX standards and earlier versions of the Single UNIX
                Specification. In 2008, a less wide-ranging revision of the standard was completed,
                yielding the combined POSIX 1003.1-2008 and SUSv4 standard.</p><p>Unlike most commercial UNIX implementations, Linux separates implementation from
                distribution. Consequently, there is no single “official” Linux distribution. Each
                Linux distributor’s offering consists of a snapshot of the current stable kernel,
                with various patches applied. The LSB develops and promotes a set of standards for
                Linux systems with the aim of ensuring binary application compatibility across Linux
                distributions, so that compiled applications should be able to run on any
                LSB-conformant system running on the same hardware.</p><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="further_information"/></div></div></div><div class="sect3" title="Further information"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title" id="further_information-id1">Further information</h4></div></div></div><p>Further information about UNIX history and standards can be found in
