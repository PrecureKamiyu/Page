<h2 class="h20"><a id="a789"></a>No. 57. SATURDAY, MAY 19, 1759.</h2>
<p class="p21">Prudence is of more frequent use than any other intellectual quality; it is exerted on slight occasions, and called into act by the cursory business of common life.</p>
<p class="p24">Whatever is universally necessary, has been granted to mankind on easy terms. Prudence, as it is always wanted, is without great difficulty obtained. It requires neither extensive view nor profound search, but forces itself, by spontaneous impulse, upon a mind neither great nor busy, neither engrossed by vast designs, nor distracted by multiplicity of attention.</p>
<p class="p24">Prudence operates on life in the same manner as rules on composition: it produces vigilance rather than elevation, rather prevents loss than procures advantage; and often escapes miscarriages, but seldom reaches either power or honour. It quenches that ardour of enterprise, by which every thing is done that can claim praise or admiration; and represses that generous temerity which often fails, and often succeeds. Rules may obviate faults, but can never confer beauties; and prudence keeps life safe, but does not often make it happy. The world is not amazed with prodigies of excellence, but when wit tramples upon rules, and magnanimity breaks the chains of prudence.</p>
<p class="p24">One of the most prudent of all that have fallen within my observation, is my old companion Sophron, who has passed through the world in quiet, by perpetual adherence to a few plain maxims, and wonders how contention and distress can so often happen.</p>
<p class="p24">The first principle of Sophron is, <span class="t8">to run no hazards</span>. Though he loves money, he is of opinion that frugality is a more certain source of riches than industry. It is to no purpose that any prospect of large profit is set before him; he believes little about futurity, and does not love to trust his money out of his sight, for <span class="t8">nobody knows what may happen</span>. He has a small estate, which he lets at the old rent, because <span class="t8">it is better to have a little than nothing</span>; but he rigorously demands payment on the stated day, for <span class="t8">he that cannot pay one quarter cannot pay two</span>. If he is told of any improvements in agriculture, he likes the old way, has observed that changes very seldom answer expectation, is of opinion that our forefathers knew how to till the ground as well as we; and concludes with an argument that nothing can overpower, that the expense of planting and fencing is immediate, and the advantage distant, and that <span class="t8">he is no wise man who will quit a certainty for an uncertainty</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">Another of Sophron&rsquo;s rules is, <span class="t8">to mind no business but his own</span>. In the state, he is of no party; but hears and speaks of publick affairs with the same coldness as of the administration of some ancient republick. If any flagrant act of fraud or oppression is mentioned, he hopes that <span class="t8">all is not true that is told</span>: if misconduct or corruption puts the nation in a flame, he hopes <span class="t8">every man means well</span>. At elections he leaves his dependants to their own choice, and declines to vote himself, for every candidate is a good man, whom he is unwilling to oppose or offend.</p>
<p class="p24">If disputes happen among his neighbours, he observes an invariable and cold neutrality. His punctuality has gained him the reputation of honesty, and his caution that of wisdom; and few would refuse to refer their claims to his award. He might have prevented many expensive law-suits, and quenched many a feud in its first smoke; but always refuses the office of arbitration, because he must decide against one or the other.</p>
<p class="p24">With the affairs of other families he is always unacquainted. He sees estates bought and sold, squandered and increased, without praising the economist, or censuring the spendthrift. He never courts the rising, lest they should fall; nor insults the fallen, lest they should rise again. His caution has the appearance of virtue, and all who do not want his help praise his benevolence; but, if any man solicits his assistance, he has just sent away all his money; and, when the petitioner is gone, declares to his family that he is sorry for his misfortunes, has always looked upon him with particular kindness, and, therefore, could not lend him money, lest he should destroy their friendship by the necessity of enforcing payment.</p>
<p class="p24">Of domestick misfortunes he has never heard. When he is told the hundredth time of a gentleman&rsquo;s daughter who has married the coachman, he lifts up his hands with astonishment, for he always thought her a sober girl.</p>
<p class="p24">When nuptial quarrels, after having filled the country with talk and laughter, at last end in separation, he never can conceive how it happened, for he looked upon them as a happy couple.</p>
<p class="p24">If his advice is asked, he never gives any particular direction, because events are uncertain, and he will bring no blame upon himself; but he takes the consulter tenderly by the hand, tells him he makes his case his own, and advises him not to act rashly, but to weigh the reasons on both sides; observes, that a man may be as easily too hasty as too slow; and that as many fail by doing too much as too little; that <span class="t8">a wise man has two ears and one tongue</span>; and that <span class="t8">little said is soon mended</span>; that he could tell him this and that, but that after all every man is the best judge of his own affairs.</p>
<p class="p24">With this some are satisfied, and go home with great reverence of Sophron&rsquo;s wisdom; and none are offended, because every one is left in full possession of his own opinion.</p>
<p class="p24">Sophron gives no characters. It is equally vain to tell him of vice and virtue; for he has remarked, that no man likes to be censured, and that very few are delighted with the praises of another. He has a few terms which he uses to all alike. With respect to fortune, he believes every one to be in good circumstances; he never exalts any understanding by lavish praise, yet he meets with none but very sensible people. Every man is honest and hearty; and every woman is a good creature.</p>
<p class="p24">Thus Sophron creeps along, neither loved nor hated, neither favoured nor opposed: he has never attempted to grow rich, for fear of growing poor; and has raised no friends, for fear of making enemies.</p>
