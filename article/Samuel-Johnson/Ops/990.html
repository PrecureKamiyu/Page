<p class="p24">Having thus authentically settled what part of the <span class="t8">Occasional Papers</span>, concerning Dr. Dodd&rsquo;s miserable situation, came from the pen of Johnson, I shall proceed to present my readers with my record of the unpublished writings relating to that extraordinary and interesting matter.</p>
<p class="p24">I found a letter to Dr. Johnson from Dr. Dodd, May 23, 1777, in which <span class="t8">The Convict&rsquo;s Address</span> seems clearly to be meant: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am so penetrated, my ever dear Sir, with a sense of your extreme benevolence towards me, that I cannot find words equal to the sentiments of my heart.</p>
<p class="p10">* * * * *</p>
<p class="p21">&lsquo;You are too conversant in the world to need the slightest hint from me, of what infinite utility the Speech on the aweful day has been to me. I experience, every hour, some good effect from it. I am sure that effects still more salutary and important must follow from <span class="t8">your kind and intended favour</span>. I will labour &mdash; GOD being my helper, &mdash; to do justice to it from the pulpit. I am sure, had I your sentiments constantly to deliver from thence, in all their mighty force and power, not a soul could be left unconvinced and unpersuaded.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p10">* * * * *</p>
<p class="p21">He added: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;May GOD ALMIGHTY bless and reward, with his choicest comforts, your philanthropick actions, and enable me at all times to express what I feel of the high and uncommon obligations which I owe to the <span class="t8">first man</span> in our times.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Sunday, June 22, he writes, begging Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s assistance in framing a supplicatory letter to his Majesty: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;If his Majesty could be moved of his royal clemency to spare me and my family the horrours and ignominy of a <span class="t8">publick death</span>, which the publick itself is solicitous to wave, and to grant me in some silent distant corner of the globe, to pass the remainder of my days in penitence and prayer, I would bless his clemency and be humbled.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">This letter was brought to Dr. Johnson when in church. He stooped down and read it, and wrote, when he went home, the following letter for Dr. Dodd to the King: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;May it not offend your Majesty, that the most miserable of men applies himself to your clemency, as his last hope and his last refuge; that your mercy is most earnestly and humbly implored by a clergyman, whom your Laws and Judges have condemned to the horrour and ignominy of a publick execution.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I confess the crime, and own the enormity of its consequences, and the danger of its example. Nor have I the confidence to petition for impunity; but humbly hope, that publick security may be established, without the spectacle of a clergyman dragged through the streets, to a death of infamy, amidst the derision of the profligate and profane; and that justice may be satisfied with irrevocable exile, perpetual disgrace, and hopeless penury.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;My life, Sir, has not been useless to mankind. I have benefited many. But my offences against GOD are numberless, and I have had little time for repentance. Preserve me, Sir, by your prerogative of mercy, from the necessity of appearing unprepared at that tribunal, before which Kings and Subjects must stand at last together. Permit me to hide my guilt in some obscure corner of a foreign country, where, if I can ever attain confidence to hope that my prayers will be heard, they shall be poured with all the fervour of gratitude for the life and happiness of your Majesty. I am, Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your Majesty&rsquo;s, &amp;c.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Subjoined to it was written as follows:</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To DR. DODD.</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I most seriously enjoin you not to let it be at all known that I have written this letter, and to return the copy to Mr. Allen in a cover to me. I hope I need not tell you, that I wish it success. &mdash; But do not indulge hope. &mdash; Tell nobody.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">It happened luckily that Mr. Allen was pitched on to assist in this melancholy office, for he was a great friend of Mr. Akerman, the keeper of Newgate. Dr. Johnson never went to see Dr. Dodd. He said to me, &lsquo;it would have done <span class="t8">him</span> more harm, than good to Dodd, who once expressed a desire to see him, but not earnestly.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Dr. Johnson, on the 20th of June, wrote the following letter:</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To THE RIGHT HONOURABLE CHARLES JENKINSON.</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Since the conviction and condemnation of Dr. Dodd, I have had, by the intervention of a friend, some intercourse with him, and I am sure I shall lose nothing in your opinion by tenderness and commiseration. Whatever be the crime, it is not easy to have any knowledge of the delinquent, without a wish that his life may be spared; at least when no life has been taken away by him. I will, therefore, take the liberty of suggesting some reasons for which I wish this unhappy being to escape the utmost rigour of his sentence.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;He is, so far as I can recollect, the first clergyman of our church who has suffered publick execution for immorality; and I know not whether it would not be more for the interest of religion to bury such an offender in the obscurity of perpetual exile, than to expose him in a cart, and on the gallows, to all who for any reason are enemies to the clergy.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The supreme power has, in all ages, paid some attention to the voice of the people; and that voice does not least deserve to be heard, when it calls out for mercy. There is now a very general desire that Dodd&rsquo;s life should be spared. More is not wished; and, perhaps, this is not too much to be granted.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;If you, Sir, have any opportunity of enforcing these reasons, you may, perhaps, think them worthy of consideration: but whatever you determine, I most respectfully intreat that you will be pleased to pardon for this intrusion, Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your most obedient</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;And most humble servant,</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">It has been confidently circulated, with invidious remarks, that to this letter no attention whatever was paid by Mr. Jenkinson (afterwards Earl of Liverpool), and that he did not even deign to shew the common civility of owning the receipt of it. I could not but wonder at such conduct in the noble Lord, whose own character and just elevation in life, I thought, must have impressed him with all due regard for great abilities and attainments. As the story had been much talked of, and apparently from good authority, I could not but have animadverted upon it in this work, had it been as was alleged; but from my earnest love of truth, and having found reason to think that there might be a mistake, I presumed to write to his Lordship, requesting an explanation; and it is with the sincerest pleasure that I am enabled to assure the world, that there is no foundation for it, the fact being, that owing to some neglect, or accident, Johnson&rsquo;s letter never came to Lord Hawkesbury&rsquo;s hands. I should have thought it strange indeed, if that noble Lord had undervalued my illustrious friend; but instead of this being the case, his Lordship, in the very polite answer with which he was pleased immediately to honour me, thus expresses himself:&mdash; &lsquo;I have always respected the memory of Dr. Johnson, and admire his writings; and I frequently read many parts of them with pleasure and great improvement.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">All applications for the Royal Mercy having failed, Dr. Dodd prepared himself for death; and, with a warmth of gratitude, wrote to Dr. Johnson as follows:</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;June 25, <span class="t8">Midnight</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Accept, thou <span class="t8">great</span> and <span class="t8">good</span> heart, my earnest and fervent thanks and prayers for all thy benevolent and kind efforts in my behalf. &mdash; Oh! Dr. Johnson! as I sought your knowledge at an early hour in life, would to heaven I had cultivated the love and acquaintance of so excellent a man! &mdash; I pray GOD most sincerely to bless you with the highest transports &mdash; the infelt satisfaction of <span class="t8">humane</span> and benevolent exertions! &mdash; And admitted, as I trust I shall be, to the realms of bliss before you, I shall hail <span class="t8">your</span> arrival there with transports, and rejoice to acknowledge that you was my Comforter, my Advocate and my <span class="t8">Friend</span>! GOD <span class="t8">be ever</span> with <span class="t8">you</span>!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Dr. Johnson lastly wrote to Dr. Dodd this solemn and soothing letter:</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To THE REVEREND DR. DODD.</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;That which is appointed to all men is now coming upon you. Outward circumstances, the eyes and the thoughts of men, are below the notice of an immortal being about to stand the trial for eternity, before the Supreme Judge of heaven and earth. Be comforted: your crime, morally or religiously considered, has no very deep dye of turpitude. It corrupted no man&rsquo;s principles; it attacked no man&rsquo;s life. It involved only a temporary and reparable injury. Of this, and of all other sins, you are earnestly to repent; and may GOD, who knoweth our frailty, and desireth not our death, accept your repentance, for the sake of his Son JESUS CHRIST our Lord.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;In requital of those well-intended offices which you are pleased so emphatically to acknowledge, let me beg that you make in your devotions one petition for my eternal welfare. I am, dear Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your affectionate servant,</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;June 26, 1777.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p26">Under the copy of this letter I found written, in Johnson&rsquo;s own hand,<br/>&lsquo;Next day, June 27, he was executed.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">To conclude this interesting episode with an useful application, let us now attend to the reflections of Johnson at the end of the <span class="t8">Occasional Papers</span>, concerning the unfortunate Dr. Dodd:</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Such were the last thoughts of a man whom we have seen exulting in popularity, and sunk in shame. For his reputation, which no man can give to himself, those who conferred it are to answer. Of his publick ministry the means of judging were sufficiently attainable. He must be allowed to preach well, whose sermons strike his audience with forcible conviction. Of his life, those who thought it consistent with his doctrine, did not originally form false notions. He was at first what he endeavoured to make others; but the world broke down his resolution, and he in time ceased to exemplify his own instructions.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Let those who are tempted to his faults, tremble at his punishment; and those whom he impressed from the pulpit with religious sentiments, endeavour to confirm them, by considering the regret and self-abhorrence with which he reviewed in prison his deviations from rectitude.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson gave us this evening, in his happy discriminative manner, a portrait of the late Mr. Fitzherbert, of Derbyshire. &lsquo;There was (said he) no sparkle, no brilliancy in Fitzherbert; but I never knew a man who was so generally acceptable. He made every body quite easy, overpowered nobody by the superiority of his talents, made no man think worse of himself by being his rival, seemed always to listen, did not oblige you to hear much from him, and did not oppose what you said. Every body liked him; but he had no friend, as I understand the word, nobody with whom he exchanged intimate thoughts. People were willing to think well of every thing about him. A gentleman was making an affected rant, as many people do, of great feelings about &ldquo;his dear son,&rdquo; who was at school near London; how anxious he was lest he might be ill, and what he would give to see him. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you (said Fitzherbert,) take a post-chaise and go to him.&rdquo; This, to be sure, <span class="t8">finished</span> the affected man, but there was not much in it. However, this was circulated as wit for a whole winter, and I believe part of a summer too; a proof that he was no very witty man. He was an instance of the truth of the observation, that a man will please more upon the whole by negative qualities than by positive; by never offending, than by giving a great deal of delight. In the first place, men hate more steadily than they love; and if I have said something to hurt a man once, I shall not get the better of this, by saying many things to please him.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Tuesday, September 16, Dr. Johnson having mentioned to me the extraordinary size and price of some cattle reared by Dr. Taylor, I rode out with our host, surveyed his farm, and was shown one cow which he had sold for a hundred and twenty guineas, and another for which he had been offered a hundred and thirty. Taylor thus described to me his old schoolfellow and friend, Johnson: &lsquo;He is a man of a very clear head, great power of words, and a very gay imagination; but there is no disputing with him. He will not hear you, and having a louder voice than you, must roar you down.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">In the afternoon I tried to get Dr. Johnson to like the Poems of Mr. Hamilton of Bangour, which I had brought with me: I had been much pleased with them at a very early age; the impression still remained on my mind; it was confirmed by the opinion of my friend the Honourable Andrew Erskine, himself both a good poet and a good critick, who thought Hamilton as true a poet as ever wrote, and that his not having fame was unaccountable. Johnson, upon repeated occasions, while I was at Ashbourne, talked slightingly of Hamilton. He said there was no power of thinking in his verses, nothing that strikes one, nothing better than what you generally find in magazines; and that the highest praise they deserved was, that they were very well for a gentleman to hand about among his friends. He said the imitation of <span class="t8">Ne sit ancillæ tibi amor</span>, &amp;c. was too solemn; he read part of it at the beginning. He read the beautiful pathetick song, <span class="t8">Ah the poor shepherd&rsquo;s mournful fate</span>, and did not seem to give attention to what I had been used to think tender elegant strains, but laughed at the rhyme, in Scotch pronunciation, <span class="t8">wishes and blushes</span>, reading <span class="t8">wushes</span> &mdash; and there he stopped. He owned that the epitaph on Lord Newhall was pretty well done. He read the <span class="t8">Inscription in a Summer-house</span>, and a little of the imitations of Horace&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Epistles</span>; but said he found nothing to make him desire to read on. When I urged that there were some good poetical passages in the book. &lsquo;Where (said he,) will you find so large a collection without some?&rsquo; I thought the description of Winter might obtain his approbation:</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;See Winter, from the frozen north<br/>Drives his iron chariot forth!<br/>His grisly hand in icy chains<br/>Fair Tweeda&rsquo;s silver flood constrains,&rsquo; &amp;c.</p>
<p class="p24">He asked why an &lsquo;<span class="t8">iron</span> chariot&rsquo;? and said &lsquo;icy chains&rsquo; was an old image. I was struck with the uncertainty of taste, and somewhat sorry that a poet whom I had long read with fondness, was not approved by Dr. Johnson. I comforted myself with thinking that the beauties were too delicate for his robust perceptions. Garrick maintained that he had not a taste for the finest productions of genius: but I was sensible, that when he took the trouble to analyse critically, he generally convinced us that he was right.</p>
<p class="p24">In the evening, the Reverend Mr. Seward, of Lichfield, who was passing through Ashbourne in his way home, drank tea with us. Johnson described him thus:&mdash; &lsquo;Sir, his ambition is to be a fine talker; so he goes to Buxton, and such places, where he may find companies to listen to him. And, Sir, he is valetudinarian, one of those who are always mending themselves. I do not know a more disagreeable character than a valetudinarian, who thinks he may do any thing that is for his ease, and indulges himself in the grossest freedoms: Sir, he brings himself to the state of a hog in a stye.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Dr. Taylor&rsquo;s nose happening to bleed, he said, it was because he had omitted to have himself blooded four days after a quarter of a year&rsquo;s interval. Dr. Johnson, who was a great dabbler in physick, disapproved much of periodical bleeding. &lsquo;For (said he) you accustom yourself to an evacuation which Nature cannot perform of herself, and therefore she cannot help you, should you, from forgetfulness or any other cause, omit it; so you may be suddenly suffocated. You may accustom yourself to other periodical evacuations, because should you omit them, Nature can supply the omission; but Nature cannot open a vein to blood you.&rsquo;&mdash; &lsquo;I do not like to take an emetick, (said Taylor,) for fear of breaking some small vessels.&rsquo;&mdash; &lsquo;Poh! (said Johnson,) if you have so many things that will break, you had better break your neck at once, and there&rsquo;s an end on&rsquo;t. You will break no small vessels&rsquo; (blowing with high derision).</p>
<p class="p24">I mentioned to Dr. Johnson, that David Hume&rsquo;s persisting in his infidelity, when he was dying, shocked me much. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why should it shock you, Sir? Hume owned he had never read the New Testament with attention. Here then was a man, who had been at no pains to inquire into the truth of religion, and had continually turned his mind the other way. It was not to be expected that the prospect of death would alter his way of thinking, unless GOD should send an angel to set him right.&rsquo; I said, I had reason to believe that the thought of annihilation gave Hume no pain. JOHNSON. &lsquo;It was not so, Sir. He had a vanity in being thought easy. It is more probable that he should assume an appearance of ease, than that so very improbable a thing should be, as a man not afraid of going (as, in spite of his delusive theory, he cannot be sure but he may go,) into an unknown state, and not being uneasy at leaving all he knew. And you are to consider, that upon his own principle of annihilation he had no motive to speak the truth.&rsquo; The horrour of death which I had always observed in Dr. Johnson, appeared strong to-night. I ventured to tell him, that I had been, for moments in my life, not afraid of death; therefore I could suppose another man in that state of mind for a considerable space of time. He said, &lsquo;he never had a moment in which death was not terrible to him.&rsquo; He added, that it had been observed, that scarce any man dies in publick, but with apparent resolution; from that desire of praise which never quits us. I said, Dr. Dodd seemed to be willing to die, and full of hopes of happiness. &lsquo;Sir, (said he,) Dr. Dodd would have given both his hands and both his legs to have lived. The better a man is, the more afraid he is of death, having a clearer view of infinite purity.&rsquo; He owned, that our being in an unhappy uncertainty as to our salvation, was mysterious; and said, &lsquo;Ah! we must wait till we are in another state of being, to have many things explained to us.&rsquo; Even the powerful mind of Johnson seemed foiled by futurity. But I thought, that the gloom of uncertainty in solemn religious speculation, being mingled with hope, was yet more consolatory than the emptiness of infidelity. A man can live in thick air, but perishes in an exhausted receiver.</p>
<p class="p24">Dr. Johnson was much pleased with a remark which I told him was made to me by General Paoli:&mdash; &lsquo;That it is impossible not to be afraid of death; and that those who at the time of dying are not afraid, are not thinking of death, but of applause, or something else, which keeps death out of their sight: so that all men are equally afraid of death when they see it; only some have a power of turning their sight away from it better than others.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Wednesday, September 17, Dr. Butter, physician at Derby, drank tea with us; and it was settled that Dr. Johnson and I should go on Friday and dine with him. Johnson said, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m glad of this.&rsquo; He seemed weary of the uniformity of life at Dr. Taylor&rsquo;s.</p>
<p class="p24">Talking of biography, I said, in writing a life, a man&rsquo;s peculiarities should be mentioned, because they mark his character. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, there is no doubt as to peculiarities: the question is, whether a man&rsquo;s vices should be mentioned; for instance, whether it should be mentioned that Addison and Parnell drank too freely: for people will probably more easily indulge in drinking from knowing this; so that more ill may be done by the example, than good by telling the whole truth.&rsquo; Here was an instance of his varying from himself in talk; for when Lord Hailes and he sat one morning calmly conversing in my house at Edinburgh, I well remember that Dr. Johnson maintained, that &lsquo;If a man is to write A <span class="t8">Panegyrick</span>, he may keep vices out of sight; but if he professes to write <span class="t8">A Life</span>, he must represent it really as it was:&rsquo; and when I objected to the danger of telling that Parnell drank to excess, he said, that &lsquo;it would produce an instructive caution to avoid drinking, when it was seen, that even the learning and genius of Parnell could be debased by it.&rsquo; And in the Hebrides he maintained, as appears from my <span class="t8">Journal</span>, that a man&rsquo;s intimate friend should mention his faults, if he writes his life.</p>
<p class="p24">He had this evening, partly, I suppose, from the spirit of contradiction to his Whig friend, a violent argument with Dr. Taylor, as to the inclinations of the people of England at this time towards the Royal Family of Stuart. He grew so outrageous as to say, &lsquo;that, if England were fairly polled, the present King would be sent away to-night, and his adherents hanged to-morrow.&rsquo; Taylor, who was as violent a Whig as Johnson was a Tory, was roused by this to a pitch of bellowing. He denied, loudly, what Johnson said; and maintained, that there was an abhorrence against the Stuart family, though he admitted that the people were not much attached to the present King. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, the state of the country is this: the people knowing it to be agreed on all hands that this King has not the hereditary right to the crown, and there being no hope that he who has it can be restored, have grown cold and indifferent upon the subject of loyalty, and have no warm attachment to any King. They would not, therefore, risk any thing to restore the exiled family. They would not give twenty shillings a piece to bring it about. But, if a mere vote could do it, there would be twenty to one; at least, there would be a very great majority of voices for it. For, Sir, you are to consider, that all those who think a King has a right to his crown, as a man has to his estate, which is the just opinion, would be for restoring the King who certainly has the hereditary right, could he be trusted with it; in which there would be no danger now, when laws and every thing else are so much advanced: and every King will govern by the laws. And you must also consider, Sir, that there is nothing on the other side to oppose to this; for it is not alleged by any one that the present family has any inherent right: so that the Whigs could not have a contest between two rights.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Dr. Taylor admitted, that if the question as to hereditary right were to be tried by a poll of the people of England, to be sure the abstract doctrine would be given in favour of the family of Stuart; but he said, the conduct of that family, which occasioned their expulsion, was so fresh in the minds of the people, that they would not vote for a restoration. Dr. Johnson, I think, was contented with the admission as to the hereditary right, leaving the original point in dispute, <span class="t8">viz</span>. what the people upon the whole would do, taking in right and affection; for he said, people were afraid of a change, even though they think it right. Dr. Taylor said something of the slight foundation of the hereditary right, of the house of Stuart. &lsquo;Sir, (said Johnson,) the house of Stuart succeeded to the full right of both the houses of York and Lancaster, whose common source had the undisputed right. A right to a throne is like a right to any thing else. Possession is sufficient, where no better right can be shown. This was the case with the Royal Family of England, as it is now with the King of France: for as to the first beginning of the right, we are in the dark.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Thursday, September 18. Last night Dr. Johnson had proposed that the crystal lustre, or chandelier, in Dr. Taylor&rsquo;s large room, should be lighted up some time or other. Taylor said, it should be lighted up next night. &lsquo;That will do very well, (said I,) for it is Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s birth-day.&rsquo; When we were in the Isle of Sky, Johnson had desired me not to mention his birth-day. He did not seem pleased at this time that I mentioned it, and said (somewhat sternly) &lsquo;he would <span class="t8">not</span> have the lustre lighted the next day.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Some ladies, who had been present yesterday when I mentioned his birth-day, came to dinner to-day, and plagued him unintentionally, by wishing him joy. I know not why he disliked having his birth-day mentioned, unless it were that it reminded him of his approaching nearer to death, of which he had a constant dread.</p>
<p class="p24">I mentioned to him a friend of mine who was formerly gloomy from low spirits, and much distressed by the fear of death, but was now uniformly placid, and contemplated his dissolution without any perturbation. &lsquo;Sir, (said Johnson,) this is only a disordered imagination taking a different turn.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">We talked of a collection being made of all the English Poets who had published a volume of poems. Johnson told me &lsquo;that a Mr. Coxeter, whom he knew, had gone the greatest length towards this; having collected, I think, about five hundred volumes of poets whose works were little known; but that upon his death Tom Osborne bought them, and they were dispersed, which he thought a pity, as it was curious to see any series complete; and in every volume of poems something good may be found.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He observed, that a gentleman of eminence in literature had got into a bad style of poetry of late. &lsquo;He puts (said he) a very common thing in a strange dress till he does not know it himself, and thinks other people do not know it.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;That is owing to his being so much versant in old English poetry.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;What is the purpose, Sir? If I say a man is drunk, and you tell me it is owing to his taking much drink, the matter is not mended. No, Sir, &mdash;&mdash; has taken to an odd mode. For example; he&rsquo;d write thus:</p>
<p class="p26">&ldquo;Hermit hoar, in solemn cell,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Wearing out life&rsquo;s evening gray.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Gray evening</span> is common enough; but <span class="t8">evening gray</span> he&rsquo;d think fine. &mdash; Stay; &mdash; we&rsquo;ll make out the stanza:</p>
<p class="p26">&ldquo;Hermit hoar, in solemn cell,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Wearing out life&rsquo;s evening gray;<br/>Smite thy bosom, sage, and tell,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;What is bliss? and which the way?&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">BOSWELL. &lsquo;But why smite his bosom, Sir?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why to shew he was in earnest,&rsquo; (smiling). &mdash; He at an after period added the following stanza:</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;Thus I spoke; and speaking sigh&rsquo;d;<br/>&nbsp;&mdash; Scarce repress&rsquo;d the starting tear; &mdash; <br/>When the smiling sage reply&rsquo;d &mdash; <br/>&nbsp;&mdash; Come, my lad, and drink some beer.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I cannot help thinking the first stanza very good solemn poetry, as also the three first lines of the second. Its last line is an excellent burlesque surprise on gloomy sentimental enquirers. And, perhaps, the advice is as good as can be given to a low-spirited dissatisfied being:&mdash; &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t trouble your head with sickly thinking: take a cup, and be merry.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Friday, September 19, after breakfast Dr. Johnson and I set out in Dr. Taylor&rsquo;s chaise to go to Derby. The day was fine, and we resolved to go by Keddlestone, the seat of Lord Scarsdale, that I might see his Lordship&rsquo;s fine house. I was struck with the magnificence of the building; and the extensive park, with the finest verdure, covered with deer, and cattle, and sheep, delighted me. The number of old oaks, of an immense size, filled me with a sort of respectful admiration: for one of them sixty pounds was offered. The excellent smooth gravel roads; the large piece of water formed by his Lordship from some small brooks, with a handsome barge upon it; the venerable Gothick church, now the family chapel, just by the house; in short, the grand group of objects agitated and distended my mind in a most agreeable manner. &lsquo;One should think (said I) that the proprietor of all this <span class="t8">must</span> be happy.&rsquo;&mdash; &lsquo;Nay, Sir, (said Johnson,) all this excludes but one evil &mdash; poverty.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Our names were sent up, and a well-drest elderly housekeeper, a most distinct articulator, shewed us the house; which I need not describe, as there is an account of it published in <span class="t8">Adam&rsquo;s Works in Architecture</span>. Dr. Johnson thought better of it to-day than when he saw it before; for he had lately attacked it violently, saying, &lsquo;It would do excellently for a town-hall. The large room with the pillars (said he) would do for the Judges to sit in at the assizes; the circular room for a jury-chamber; and the room above for prisoners.&rsquo; Still he thought the large room ill lighted, and of no use but for dancing in; and the bed-chambers but indifferent rooms; and that the immense sum which it cost was injudiciously laid out. Dr. Taylor had put him in mind of his <span class="t8">appearing</span> pleased with the house. &lsquo;But (said he) that was when Lord Scarsdale was present. Politeness obliges us to appear pleased with a man&rsquo;s works when he is present. No man will be so ill bred as to question you. You may therefore pay compliments without saying what is not true. I should say to Lord Scarsdale of his large room, &ldquo;My Lord, this is the most <span class="t8">costly</span> room that I ever saw;&rdquo; which is true.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Dr. Manningham, physician in London, who was visiting at Lord Scarsdale&rsquo;s, accompanyed us through many of the rooms, and soon afterwards my Lord himself, to whom Dr. Johnson was known, appeared, and did the honours of the house. We talked of Mr. Langton. Johnson, with a warm vehemence of affectionate regard, exclaimed, &lsquo;The earth does not bear a worthier man than Bennet Langton.&rsquo; We saw a good many fine pictures, which I think are described in one of <span class="t8">Young&rsquo;s Tours</span>. There is a printed catalogue of them which the housekeeper put into my hand; I should like to view them at leisure. I was much struck with Daniel interpreting Nebuchadnezzar&rsquo;s dream by Rembrandt. We were shown a pretty large library. In his Lordship&rsquo;s dressing-room lay Johnson&rsquo;s small <span class="t8">Dictionary</span>: he shewed it to me, with some eagerness, saying, &lsquo;Look &lsquo;ye! <span class="t8">Quæ terra nostri non plena laboris</span>.&rsquo; He observed, also, Goldsmith&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Animated Nature</span>; and said, &lsquo;Here&rsquo;s our friend! The poor Doctor would have been happy to hear of this.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">In our way, Johnson strongly expressed his love of driving fast in a post-chaise. &lsquo;If (said he) I had no duties, and no reference to futurity, I would spend my life in driving briskly in a post-chaise with a pretty woman; but she should be one who could understand me, and would add something to the conversation.&rsquo; I observed, that we were this day to stop just where the Highland army did in 1745. JOHNSON. &lsquo;It was a noble attempt.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;I wish we could have an authentick history of it.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;If you were not an idle dog you might write it, by collecting from every body what they can tell, and putting down your authorities.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;But I could not have the advantage of it in my life-time.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;You might have the satisfaction of its fame, by printing it in Holland; and as to profit, consider how long it was before writing came to be considered in a pecuniary view. Baretti says, he is the first man that ever received copy-money in Italy.&rsquo; I said that I would endeavour to do what Dr. Johnson suggested; and I thought that I might write so as to venture to publish my <span class="t8">History of the Civil War in Great-Britain in 1745 and 1746</span> without being obliged to go to a foreign press.</p>
<p class="p24">When we arrived at Derby, Dr. Butter accompanied us to see the manufactory of china there. I admired the ingenuity and delicate art with which a man fashioned clay into a cup, a saucer, or a tea-pot, while a boy turned round a wheel to give the mass rotundity. I thought this as excellent in its species of power, as making good verses in <span class="t8">its</span> species. Yet I had no respect for this potter. Neither, indeed, has a man of any extent of thinking for a mere verse-maker, in whose numbers, however perfect, there is no poetry, no mind. The china was beautiful, but Dr. Johnson justly observed it was too dear; for that he could have vessels of silver, of the same size, as cheap as what were here made of porcelain.</p>
<p class="p24">I felt a pleasure in walking about Derby such as I always have in walking about any town to which I am not accustomed. There is an immediate sensation of novelty; and one speculates on the way in which life is passed in it, which, although there is a sameness every where upon the whole, is yet minutely diversified. The minute diversities in every thing are wonderful. Talking of shaving the other night at Dr. Taylor&rsquo;s, Dr. Johnson said, &lsquo;Sir, of a thousand shavers, two do not shave so much alike as not to be distinguished.&rsquo; I thought this not possible, till he specified so many of the varieties in shaving; &mdash; holding the razor more or less perpendicular; &mdash; drawing long or short strokes; &mdash; beginning at the upper part of the face, or the under; &mdash; at the right side or the left side. Indeed, when one considers what variety of sounds can be uttered by the windpipe, in the compass of a very small aperture, we may be convinced how many degrees of difference there may be in the application of a razor.</p>
<p class="p24">We dined with Dr. Butter, whose lady is daughter of my cousin Sir John Douglas, whose grandson is now presumptive heir of the noble family of Queensberry. Johnson and he had a good deal of medical conversation. Johnson said, he had somewhere or other given an account of Dr. Nichols&rsquo;s discourse <span class="t8">De Animá Medicâ</span>. He told us &lsquo;that whatever a man&rsquo;s distemper was, Dr. Nichols would not attend him as a physician, if his mind was not at ease; for he believed that no medicines would have any influence. He once attended a man in trade, upon whom he found none of the medicines he prescribed had any effect: he asked the man&rsquo;s wife privately whether his affairs were not in a bad way? She said no. He continued his attendance some time, still without success. At length the man&rsquo;s wife told him, she had discovered that her husband&rsquo;s affairs <span class="t8">were</span> in a bad way. When Goldsmith was dying, Dr. Turton said to him, &ldquo;Your pulse is in greater disorder than it should be, from the degree of fever which you have: is your mind at ease?&rdquo; Goldsmith answered it was not.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">After dinner, Mrs. Butter went with me to see the silk-mill which Mr. John Lombe had had a patent for, having brought away the contrivance from Italy. I am not very conversant with mechanicks; but the simplicity of this machine, and its multiplied operations, struck me with an agreeable surprize. I had learnt from Dr. Johnson, during this interview, not to think with a dejected indifference of the works of art, and the pleasures of life, because life is uncertain and short; but to consider such indifference as a failure of reason, a morbidness of mind; for happiness should be cultivated as much as we can, and the objects which are instrumental to it should be steadily considered as of importance, with a reference not only to ourselves, but to multitudes in successive ages. Though it is proper to value small parts, as</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Sands make the mountain, moments make the year;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">yet we must contemplate, collectively, to have a just estimation of objects. One moment&rsquo;s being uneasy or not, seems of no consequence; yet this may be thought of the next, and the next, and so on, till there is a large portion of misery. In the same way one must think of happiness, of learning, of friendship. We cannot tell the precise moment when friendship is formed. As in filling a vessel drop by drop, there is at last a drop which makes it run over; so in a series of kindnesses there is at last one which makes the heart run over. We must not divide objects of our attention into minute parts, and think separately of each part. It is by contemplating a large mass of human existence, that a man, while he sets a just value on his own life, does not think of his death as annihilating all that is great and pleasing in the world, as if actually <span class="t8">contained in his mind</span>, according to Berkeley&rsquo;s reverie. If his imagination be not sickly and feeble, it &lsquo;wings its distant way&rsquo; far beyond himself, and views the world in unceasing activity of every sort. It must be acknowledged, however, that Pope&rsquo;s plaintive reflection, that all things would be as gay as ever, on the day of his death, is natural and common. We are apt to transfer to all around us our own gloom, without considering that at any given point of time there is, perhaps, as much youth and gaiety in the world as at another. Before I came into this life, in which I have had so many pleasant scenes, have not thousands and ten thousands of deaths and funerals happened, and have not families been in grief for their nearest relations? But have those dismal circumstances at all affected <span class="t8">me</span>? Why then should the gloomy scenes which I experience, or which I know, affect others? Let us guard against imagining that there is an end of felicity upon earth, when we ourselves grow old, or are unhappy.</p>
<p class="p24">Dr. Johnson told us at tea, that when some of Dr. Dodd&rsquo;s pious friends were trying to console him by saying that he was going to leave &lsquo;a wretched world,&rsquo; he had honesty enough not to join in the cant:&mdash; &lsquo;No, no (said he,) it has been a very agreeable world to me.&rsquo; Johnson added, &lsquo;I respect Dodd for thus speaking the truth; for, to be sure, he had for several years enjoyed a life of great voluptuousness.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He told us, that Dodd&rsquo;s city friends stood by him so, that a thousand pounds were ready to be given to the gaoler, if he would let him escape. He added, that he knew a friend of Dodd&rsquo;s, who walked about Newgate for some time on the evening before the day of his execution, with five hundred pounds in his pocket, ready to be paid to any of the turnkeys who could get him out: but it was too late; for he was watched with much circumspection. He said, Dodd&rsquo;s friends had an image of him made of wax, which was to have been left in his place; and he believed it was carried into the prison.</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson disapproved of Dr. Dodd&rsquo;s leaving the world persuaded that <span class="t8">The Convict&rsquo;s Address to his unhappy Brethren</span> was of his own writing. &lsquo;But, Sir, (said I,) you contributed to the deception; for when Mr. Seward expressed a doubt to you that it was not Dodd&rsquo;s own, because it had a great deal more force of mind in it than any thing known to be his, you answered,&mdash; &ldquo;Why should you think so? Depend upon it, Sir, when a man knows he is to be hanged in a fortnight, it concentrates his mind wonderfully.&rdquo;&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, as Dodd got it from me to pass as his own, while that could do him any good, there was an <span class="t8">implied promise</span> that I should not own it. To own it, therefore, would have been telling a lie, with the addition of breach of promise, which was worse than simply telling a lie to make it be believed it was Dodd&rsquo;s. Besides, Sir, I did not <span class="t8">directly</span> tell a lie: I left the matter uncertain. Perhaps I thought that Seward would not believe it the less to be mine for what I said; but I would not put it in his power to say I had owned it.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He praised Blair&rsquo;s sermons: &lsquo;Yet,&rsquo; said he, (willing to let us see he was aware that fashionable fame, however deserved, is not always the most lasting,) &lsquo;perhaps, they may not be re-printed after seven years; at least not after Blair&rsquo;s death.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He said, &lsquo;Goldsmith was a plant that flowered late. There appeared nothing remarkable about him when he was young; though when he had got high in fame, one of his friends began to recollect something of his being distinguished at College. Goldsmith in the same manner recollected more of that friend&rsquo;s early years, as he grew a greater man.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I mentioned that Lord Monboddo told me, he awaked every morning at four, and then for his health got up and walked in his room naked, with the window open, which he called taking <span class="t8">an air bath</span>; after which he went to bed again, and slept two hours more. Johnson, who was always ready to beat down any thing that seemed to be exhibited with disproportionate importance, thus observed: &lsquo;I suppose, Sir, there is no more in it than this, he awakes at four, and cannot sleep till he chills himself, and makes the warmth of the bed a grateful sensation.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I talked of the difficulty of rising in the morning. Dr. Johnson told me, &lsquo;that the learned Mrs. Carter, at that period when she was eager in study, did not awake as early as she wished, and she therefore had a contrivance, that, at a certain hour, her chamber-light should burn a string to which a heavy weight was suspended, which then fell with a strong sudden noise: this roused her from sleep, and then she had no difficulty in getting up.&rsquo; But I said <span class="t8">that</span> was my difficulty; and wished there could be some medicine invented which would make one rise without pain, which I never did, unless after lying in bed a very long time. Perhaps there may be something in the stores of Nature which could do this. I have thought of a pulley to raise me gradually; but that would give me pain, as it would counteract my internal inclination. I would have something that can dissipate the <span class="t8">vis inertiæ</span>, and give elasticity to the muscles. As I imagine that the human body may be put, by the operation of other substances, into any state in which it has ever been; and as I have experienced a state in which rising from bed was not disagreeable, but easy, nay, sometimes agreeable; I suppose that this state may be produced, if we knew by what. We can heat the body, we can cool it; we can give it tension or relaxation; and surely it is possible to bring it into a state in which rising from bed will not be a pain.</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson observed, that &lsquo;a man should take a sufficient quantity of sleep, which Dr. Mead says is between seven and nine hours.&rsquo; I told him, that Dr. Cullen said to me, that a man should not take more sleep than he can take at once. JOHNSON. &lsquo;This rule, Sir, cannot hold in all cases; for many people have their sleep broken by sickness; and surely, Cullen would not have a man to get up, after having slept but an hour. Such a regimen would soon end in a <span class="t8">long sleep</span>.&rsquo; Dr. Taylor remarked, I think very justly, that &lsquo;a man who does not feel an inclination to sleep at the ordinary time, instead of being stronger than other people, must not be well; for a man in health has all the natural inclinations to eat, drink, and sleep, in a strong degree.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson advised me to-night not to <span class="t8">refine</span> in the education of my children. &lsquo;Life (said he) will not bear refinement: you must do as other people do.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">As we drove back to Ashbourne, Dr. Johnson recommended to me, as he had often done, to drink water only: &lsquo;For (said he) you are then sure not to get drunk; whereas if you drink wine you are never sure.&rsquo; I said, drinking wine was a pleasure which I was unwilling to give up. &lsquo;Why, Sir, (said he,) there is no doubt that not to drink wine is a great deduction from life; but it may be necessary.&rsquo; He however owned, that in his opinion a free use of wine did not shorten life; and said, he would not give less for the life of a certain Scotch Lord (whom he named) celebrated for hard drinking, than for that of a sober man. &lsquo;But stay, (said he, with his usual intelligence, and accuracy of enquiry,) does it take much wine to make him drunk?&rsquo; I answered, &lsquo;a great deal either of wine or strong punch.&rsquo;&mdash; &lsquo;Then (said he) that is the worse.&rsquo; I presume to illustrate my friend&rsquo;s observation thus: &lsquo;A fortress which soon surrenders has its walls less shattered than when a long and obstinate resistance is made.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I ventured to mention a person who was as violent a Scotsman as he was an Englishman; and literally had the same contempt for an Englishman compared with a Scotsman, that he had for a Scotsman compared with an Englishman; and that he would say of Dr. Johnson, &lsquo;Damned rascal! to talk as he does, of the Scotch.&rsquo; This seemed, for a moment, &lsquo;to give him pause.&rsquo; It, perhaps, presented his extreme prejudice against the Scotch in a point of view somewhat new to him, by the effect of <span class="t8">contrast</span>.</p>
<p class="p26">By the time when we returned to Ashbourne, Dr. Taylor was gone to bed.<br/>Johnson and I sat up a long time by ourselves.</p>
<p class="p24">He was much diverted with an article which I shewed him in the <span class="t8">Critical Review</span> of this year, giving an account of a curious publication, entitled, <span class="t8">A Spiritual Diary and Soliloquies</span>, by John Rutty, M.D. Dr. Rutty was one of the people called Quakers, a physician of some eminence in Dublin, and authour of several works. This Diary, which was kept from 1753 to 1775, the year in which he died, and was now published in two volumes octavo, exhibited, in the simplicity of his heart, a minute and honest register of the state of his mind; which, though frequently laughable enough, was not more so than the history of many men would be, if recorded with equal fairness.</p>
<p class="p24">The following specimens were extracted by the Reviewers: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Tenth month, 1753. 23. Indulgence in bed an hour too long. Twelfth month, 17. An hypochondriack obnubilation from wind and indigestion. Ninth month, 28. An over-dose of whisky. 29. A dull, cross, cholerick day. First month, 1757 &mdash; 22. A little swinish at dinner and repast. 31. Dogged on provocation. Second month, 5. Very dogged or snappish. 14. Snappish on fasting. 26. Cursed snappishness to those under me, on a bodily indisposition. Third month, 11. On a provocation, exercised a dumb resentment for two days, instead of scolding. 22. Scolded too vehemently. 23. Dogged again. Fourth month, 29. Mechanically and sinfully dogged.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson laughed heartily at this good Quietist&rsquo;s self-condemning minutes; particularly at his mentioning, with such a serious regret, occasional instances of &lsquo;<span class="t8">swinishness</span> in eating, and <span class="t8">doggedness of temper</span>.&rsquo; He thought the observations of the Critical Reviewers upon the importance of a man to himself so ingenious and so well expressed, that I shall here introduce them.</p>
<p class="p24">After observing, that &lsquo;There are few writers who have gained any reputation by recording their own actions,&rsquo; they say: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;We may reduce the egotists to four classes. In the <span class="t8">first</span> we have Julius Caesar: he relates his own transactions; but he relates them with peculiar grace and dignity, and his narrative is supported by the greatness of his character and atchievements. In the <span class="t8">second</span> class we have Marcus Antoninus: this writer has given us a series of reflections on his own life; but his sentiments are so noble, his morality so sublime, that his meditations are universally admired. In the <span class="t8">third</span> class we have some others of tolerable credit, who have given importance to their own private history by an intermixture of literary anecdotes, and the occurrences of their own times: the celebrated <span class="t8">Huetius</span> has published an entertaining volume upon this plan, &ldquo;<span class="t8">De rebus ad eum pertinentibus</span>.&rdquo; In the <span class="t8">fourth</span> class we have the journalists, temporal and spiritual: Elias Ashmole, William Lilly, George Whitefield, John Wesley, and a thousand other old women and fanatick writers of memoirs and meditations.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I mentioned to him that Dr. Hugh Blair, in his lectures on Rhetorick and Belles Lettres, which I heard him deliver at Edinburgh, had animadverted on the Johnsonian style as too pompous; and attempted to imitate it, by giving a sentence of Addison in <span class="t8">The Spectator</span>, No. 411, in the manner of Johnson. When treating of the utility of the pleasures of imagination in preserving us from vice, it is observed of those &lsquo;who know not how to be idle and innocent,&rsquo; that &lsquo;their very first step out of business is into vice or folly;&rsquo; which Dr. Blair supposed would have been expressed in <span class="t8">The Rambler</span> thus: &lsquo;Their very first step out of the regions of business is into the perturbation of vice, or the vacuity of folly.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, these are not the words I should have used. No, Sir; the imitators of my style have not hit it. Miss Aikin has done it the best; for she has imitated the sentiment as well as the diction.&rsquo; I intend, before this work is concluded, to exhibit specimens of imitation of my friend&rsquo;s style in various modes; some caricaturing or mimicking it, and some formed upon it, whether intentionally or with a degree of similarity to it, of which, perhaps, the writers were not conscious.</p>
<p class="p24">In Baretti&rsquo;s Review, which he published in Italy, under the title of <span class="t8">Frusta Letteraria</span>, it is observed, that Dr. Robertson the historian had formed his style upon that of <span class="t8">Il celebre Samuele Johnson</span>. My friend himself was of that opinion; for he once said to me, in a pleasant humour, &lsquo;Sir, if Robertson&rsquo;s style be faulty, he owes it to me; that is, having too many words, and those too big ones.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I read to him a letter which Lord Monboddo had written to me, containing some critical remarks upon the style of his <span class="t8">Journey to the Western Islands of Scotland</span>. His Lordship praised the very fine passage upon landing at Icolmkill; but his own style being exceedingly dry and hard, he disapproved of the richness of Johnson&rsquo;s language, and of his frequent use of metaphorical expressions. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, this criticism would be just, if in my style, superfluous words, or words too big for the thoughts, could be pointed out; but this I do not believe can be done. For instance; in the passage which Lord Monboddo admires, &lsquo;We were now treading that illustrious region,&rsquo; the word <span class="t8">illustrious</span>, contributes nothing to the mere narration; for the fact might be told without it: but it is not, therefore, superfluous; for it wakes the mind to peculiar attention, where something of more than usual importance is to be presented. &ldquo;Illustrious!&rdquo; &mdash; for what? and then the sentence proceeds to expand the circumstances connected with Iona. And, Sir, as to metaphorical expression, that is a great excellence in style, when it is used with propriety, for it gives you two ideas for one; &mdash; conveys the meaning more luminously, and generally with a perception of delight.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He told me, that he had been asked to undertake the new edition of the <span class="t8">Biographia Britannica</span>, but had declined it; which he afterwards said to me he regretted. In this regret many will join, because it would have procured us more of Johnson&rsquo;s most delightful species of writing; and although my friend Dr. Kippis has hitherto discharged the task judiciously, distinctly, and with more impartiality than might have been expected from a Separatist, it were to have been wished that the superintendence of this literary Temple of Fame had been assigned to &lsquo;a friend to the constitution in Church and State.&rsquo; We should not then have had it too much crowded with obscure dissenting teachers, doubtless men of merit and worth, but not quite to be numbered amongst &lsquo;the most eminent persons who have flourished in Great-Britain and Ireland.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Saturday, September 30, after breakfast, when Taylor was gone out to his farm, Dr. Johnson and I had a serious conversation by ourselves on melancholy and madness; which he was, I always thought, erroneously inclined to confound together. Melancholy, like &lsquo;great wit,&rsquo; may be &lsquo;near allied to madness;&rsquo; but there is, in my opinion, a distinct separation between them. When he talked of madness, he was to be understood as speaking of those who were in any great degree disturbed, or as it is commonly expressed, &lsquo;troubled in mind.&rsquo; Some of the ancient philosophers held, that all deviations from right reason were madness; and whoever wishes to see the opinions both of ancients and moderns upon this subject, collected and illustrated with a variety of curious facts, may read Dr. Arnold&rsquo;s very entertaining work.</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson said, &lsquo;A madman loves to be with people whom he fears; not as a dog fears the lash; but of whom he stands in awe.&rsquo; I was struck with the justice of this observation. To be with those of whom a person, whose mind is wavering and dejected, stands in awe, represses and composes an uneasy tumult of spirits, and consoles him with the contemplation of something steady, and at least comparatively great.</p>
<p class="p24">He added, &lsquo;Madmen are all sensual in the lower stages of the distemper. They are eager for gratifications to sooth their minds, and divert their attention from the misery which they suffer: but when they grow very ill, pleasure is too weak for them, and they seek for pain. Employment, Sir, and hardships, prevent melancholy. I suppose in all our army in America there was not one man who went mad.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">We entered seriously upon a question of much importance to me, which Johnson was pleased to consider with friendly attention. I had long complained to him that I felt myself discontented in Scotland, as too narrow a sphere, and that I wished to make my chief residence in London, the great scene of ambition, instruction, and amusement: a scene, which was to me, comparatively speaking, a heaven upon earth. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, I never knew any one who had such a <span class="t8">gust</span> for London as you have: and I cannot blame you for your wish to live there: yet, Sir, were I in your father&rsquo;s place, I should not consent to your settling there; for I have the old feudal notions, and I should be afraid that Auchinleck would be deserted, as you would soon find it more desirable to have a country-seat in a better climate. I own, however, that to consider it as a <span class="t8">duty</span> to reside on a family estate is a prejudice; for we must consider, that working-people get employment equally, and the produce of land is sold equally, whether a great family resides at home or not; and if the rents of an estate be carried to London, they return again in the circulation of commerce; nay, Sir, we must perhaps allow, that carrying the rents to a distance is a good, because it contributes to that circulation. We must, however, allow, that a well-regulated great family may improve a neighbourhood in civility and elegance, and give an example of good order, virtue, and piety; and so its residence at home may be of much advantage. But if a great family be disorderly and vicious, its residence at home is very pernicious to a neighbourhood. There is not now the same inducement to live in the country as formerly; the pleasures of social life are much better enjoyed in town; and there is no longer in the country that power and influence in proprietors of land which they had in old times, and which made the country so agreeable to them. The Laird of Auchinleck now is not near so great a man as the Laird of Auchinleck was a hundred years ago.</p>
<p class="p24">I told him, that one of my ancestors never went from home without being attended by thirty men on horseback. Johnson&rsquo;s shrewdness and spirit of enquiry were exerted upon every occasion. &lsquo;Pray (said he,) how did your ancestor support his thirty men and thirty horses, when he went at a distance from home, in an age when there was hardly any money in circulation?&rsquo; I suggested the same difficulty to a friend, who mentioned Douglas&rsquo;s going to the Holy Land with a numerous train of followers. Douglas could, no doubt, maintain followers enough while living upon his own lands, the produce of which supplied them with food; but he could not carry that food to the Holy Land; and as there was no commerce by which he could be supplied with money, how could he maintain them in foreign countries?</p>
<p class="p24">I suggested a doubt, that if I were to reside in London, the exquisite zest with which I relished it in occasional visits might go off, and I might grow tired of it. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, you find no man, at all intellectual, who is willing to leave London. No, Sir, when a man is tired of London, he is tired of life; for there is in London all that life can afford.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">To obviate his apprehension, that by settling in London I might desert the seat of my ancestors, I assured him, that I had old feudal principles to a degree of enthusiasm; and that I felt all the <span class="t8">dulcedo</span> of the <span class="t8">natale solum</span>. I reminded him, that the Laird of Auchinleck had an elegant house, in front of which he could ride ten miles forward upon his own territories, upon which he had upwards of six hundred people attached to him; that the family seat was rich in natural romantick beauties of rock, wood, and water; and that in my &lsquo;morn of life,&rsquo; I had appropriated the finest descriptions in the ancient Classicks to certain scenes there, which were thus associated in my mind. That when all this was considered, I should certainly pass a part of the year at home, and enjoy it the more from variety, and from bringing with me a share of the intellectual stores of the metropolis. He listened to all this, and kindly &lsquo;hoped it might be as I now supposed.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He said, &lsquo;A country gentleman should bring his lady to visit London as soon as he can, that they may have agreeable topicks for conversation when they are by themselves.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">As I meditated trying my fortune in Westminster Hall, our conversation turned upon the profession of the law in England. JOHNSON. &lsquo;You must not indulge too sanguine hopes, should you be called to our bar. I was told, by a very sensible lawyer, that there are a great many chances against any man&rsquo;s success in the profession of the law; the candidates are so numerous, and those who get large practice so few. He said, it was by no means true that a man of good parts and application is sure of having business, though he, indeed, allowed that if such a man could but appear in a few causes, his merit would be known, and he would get forward; but that the great risk was, that a man might pass half a life-time in the Courts, and never have an opportunity of shewing his abilities.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">We talked of employment being absolutely necessary to preserve the mind from wearying and growing fretful, especially in those who have a tendency to melancholy; and I mentioned to him a saying which somebody had related of an American savage, who, when an European was expatiating on all the advantages of money, put this question: &lsquo;Will it purchase <span class="t8">occupation</span>?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Depend upon it, Sir, this saying is too refined for a savage. And, Sir, money <span class="t8">will</span> purchase occupation; it will purchase all the conveniences of life; it will purchase variety of company; it will purchase all sorts of entertainment.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I talked to him of Forster&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Voyage to the South Seas</span>, which pleased me; but I found he did not like it. &lsquo;Sir, (said he,) there is a great affectation of fine writing in it.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;But he carries you along with him.&rsquo; JOHNSON, &lsquo;No, Sir; he does not carry <span class="t8">me</span> along with him: he leaves me behind him: or rather, indeed, he sets me before him; for he makes me turn over many leaves at a time.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Sunday, September 12, we went to the church of Ashbourne, which is one of the largest and most luminous that I have seen in any town of the same size. I felt great satisfaction in considering that I was supported in my fondness for solemn publick worship by the general concurrence and munificence of mankind.</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson and Taylor were so different from each other, that I wondered at their preserving an intimacy. Their having been at school and college together, might, in some degree, account for this; but Sir Joshua Reynolds has furnished me with a stronger reason; for Johnson mentioned to him, that he had been told by Taylor he was to be his heir. I shall not take upon me to animadvert upon this; but certain it is, that Johnson paid great attention to Taylor. He now, however, said to me, &lsquo;Sir, I love him; but I do not love him more; my regard for him does not increase. As it is said in the Apocrypha, &ldquo;his talk is of bullocks:&rdquo; I do not suppose he is very fond of my company. His habits are by no means sufficiently clerical: this he knows that I see; and no man likes to live under the eye of perpetual disapprobation.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I have no doubt that a good many sermons were composed for Taylor by Johnson. At this time I found, upon his table, a part of one which he had newly begun to write: and <span class="t8">Concio pro Tayloro</span> appears in one of his diaries. When to these circumstances we add the internal evidence from the power of thinking and style, in the collection which the Reverend Mr. Hayes has published, with the <span class="t8">significant</span> title of Sermons <span class="t8">left for publication</span> by the Reverend John Taylor, LL.D., our conviction will be complete.</p>
<p class="p24">I, however, would not have it thought, that Dr. Taylor, though he could not write like Johnson, (as, indeed, who could?) did not sometimes compose sermons as good as those which we generally have from very respectable divines. He showed me one with notes on the margin in Johnson&rsquo;s hand-writing; and I was present when he read another to Johnson, that he might have his opinion of it, and Johnson said it was &lsquo;very well.&rsquo; These, we may be sure, were not Johnson&rsquo;s; for he was above little arts, or tricks of deception.</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson was by no means of opinion, that every man of a learned profession should consider it as incumbent upon him, or as necessary to his credit, to appear as an authour. When in the ardour of ambition for literary fame, I regretted to him one day that an eminent Judge had nothing of it, and therefore would leave no perpetual monument of himself to posterity. &lsquo;Alas, Sir, (said Johnson) what a mass of confusion should we have, if every Bishop, and every Judge, every Lawyer, Physician, and Divine, were to write books.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I mentioned to Johnson a respectable person of a very strong mind, who had little of that tenderness which is common to human nature; as an instance of which, when I suggested to him that he should invite his son, who had been settled ten years in foreign parts, to come home and pay him a visit, his answer was, &lsquo;No, no, let him mind his business.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;I do not agree with him, Sir, in this. Getting money is not all a man&rsquo;s business: to cultivate kindness is a valuable part of the business of life.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">In the evening, Johnson, being in very good spirits, entertained us with several characteristical portraits. I regret that any of them escaped my retention and diligence. I found, from experience, that to collect my friend&rsquo;s conversation so as to exhibit it with any degree of its original flavour, it was necessary to write it down without delay. To record his sayings, after some distance of time, was like preserving or pickling long-kept and faded fruits, or other vegetables, which, when in that state, have little or nothing of their taste when fresh.</p>
<p class="p24">I shall present my readers with a series of what I gathered this evening from the Johnsonian garden.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;My friend, the late Earl of Corke, had a great desire to maintain the literary character of his family: he was a genteel man, but did not keep up the dignity of his rank. He was so generally civil, that nobody thanked him for it.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Did we not hear so much said of Jack Wilkes, we should think more highly of his conversation. Jack has great variety of talk, Jack is a scholar, and Jack has the manners of a gentleman. But after hearing his name sounded from pole to pole, as the phoenix of convivial felicity, we are disappointed in his company. He has always been <span class="t8">at me</span>: but I would do Jack a kindness, rather than not. The contest is now over.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Garrick&rsquo;s gaiety of conversation has delicacy and elegance: Foote makes you laugh more; but Foote has the air of a buffoon paid for entertaining the company. He, indeed, well deserves his hire.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Colley Cibber once consulted me as to one of his birth-day Odes, a long time before it was wanted. I objected very freely to several passages. Cibber lost patience, and would not read his Ode to an end. When we had done with criticism, we walked over to Richardson&rsquo;s, the authour of <span class="t8">Clarissa</span>, and I wondered to find Richardson displeased that I &ldquo;did not treat Gibber with more <span class="t8">respect</span>.&rdquo; Now, Sir, to talk of <span class="t8">respect for a player</span>!&rsquo; (smiling disdainfully). BOSWELL. &lsquo;There, Sir, you are always heretical: you never will allow merit to a player.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Merit, Sir! what merit? Do you respect a rope-dancer, or a ballad-singer?&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;No, Sir: but we respect a great player, as a man who can conceive lofty sentiments, and can express them gracefully.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;What, Sir, a fellow who claps a hump on his back, and a lump on his leg, and cries &ldquo;<span class="t8">I am Richard the Third</span>&rdquo;? Nay, Sir, a ballad-singer is a higher man, for he does two things; he repeats and he sings: there is both recitation and musick in his performance: the player only recites.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;My dear Sir! you may turn anything into ridicule. I allow, that a player of farce is not entitled to respect; he does a little thing: but he who can represent exalted characters, and touch the noblest passions, has very respectable powers; and mankind have agreed in admiring great talents for the stage. We must consider, too, that a great player does what very few are capable to do: his art is a very rare faculty. <span class="t8">Who</span> can repeat Hamlet&rsquo;s soliloquy, &ldquo;To be, or not to be,&rdquo; as Garrick does it?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Any body may. Jemmy, there (a boy about eight years old, who was in the room), will do it as well in a week.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;No, no, Sir: and as a proof of the merit of great acting, and of the value which mankind set upon it, Garrick has got a hundred thousand pounds.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Is getting a hundred thousand pounds a proof of excellence? That has been done by a scoundrel commissary.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">This was most fallacious reasoning. I was sure, for once, that I had the best side of the argument. I boldly maintained the just distinction between a tragedian and a mere theatrical droll; between those who rouse our terrour and pity, and those who only make us laugh. &lsquo;If (said I) Betterton and Foote were to walk into this room, you would respect Betterton much more than Foote.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;If Betterton were to walk into this room with Foote, Foote would soon drive him out of it. Foote, Sir, <span class="t8">quatenùs</span> Foote, has powers superiour to them all.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Monday, September 22, when at breakfast, I unguardedly said to Dr. Johnson, &lsquo;I wish I saw you and Mrs. Macaulay together.&rsquo; He grew very angry; and, after a pause, while a cloud gathered on his brow, he burst out, &lsquo;No, Sir; you would not see us quarrel, to make you sport. Don&rsquo;t you know that it is very uncivil to <span class="t8">pit</span> two people against one another?&rsquo; Then, checking himself, and wishing to be more gentle, he added, &lsquo;I do not say you should be hanged or drowned for this; but it <span class="t8">is</span> very uncivil.&rsquo; Dr. Taylor thought him in the wrong, and spoke to him privately of it; but I afterwards acknowledged to Johnson that I was to blame, for I candidly owned, that I meant to express a desire to see a contest between Mrs. Macaulay and him; but then I knew how the contest would end; so that I was to see him triumph. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, you cannot be sure how a contest will end; and no man has a right to engage two people in a dispute by which their passions may be inflamed, and they may part with bitter resentment against each other. I would sooner keep company with a man from whom I must guard my pockets, than with a man who contrives to bring me into a dispute with somebody that he may hear it. This is the great fault of &mdash;&mdash; , (naming one of our friends) endeavouring to introduce a subject upon which he knows two people in the company differ.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;But he told me, Sir, he does it for instruction.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Whatever the motive be, Sir, the man who does so, does very wrong. He has no more right to instruct himself at such risk, than he has to make two people fight a duel, that he may learn how to defend himself.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He found great fault with a gentleman of our acquaintance for keeping a bad table. &lsquo;Sir, (said he,) when a man is invited to dinner, he is disappointed if he does not get something good. I advised Mrs. Thrale, who has no card-parties at her house, to give sweet-meats, and such good things, in an evening, as are not commonly given, and she would find company enough come to her; for every body loves to have things which please the palate put in their way, without trouble or preparation.&rsquo; Such was his attention to the <span class="t8">minutiae</span> of life and manners.</p>
<p class="p24">He thus characterised the Duke of Devonshire, grandfather of the present representative of that very respectable family: &lsquo;He was not a man of superiour abilities, but he was a man strictly faithful to his word. If, for instance, he had promised you an acorn, and none had grown that year in his woods, he would not have contented himself with that excuse; he would have sent to Denmark for it. So unconditional was he in keeping his word; so high as to the point of honour.&rsquo; This was a liberal testimony from the Tory Johnson to the virtue of a great Whig nobleman.</p>
<p class="p24">Mr. Burke&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Letter to the Sheriffs of Bristol, on the affairs of America</span>, being mentioned, Johnson censured the composition much, and he ridiculed the definition of a free government, <span class="t8">viz</span>. &lsquo;For any practical purpose, it is what the people think so.&rsquo;&mdash; &lsquo;I will let the King of France govern me on those conditions, (said he,) for it is to be governed just as I please.&rsquo; And when Dr. Taylor talked of a girl being sent to a parish workhouse, and asked how much she could be obliged to work, &lsquo;Why, (said Johnson,) as much as is reasonable: and what is that? as much as <span class="t8">she thinks</span> reasonable.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Dr. Johnson obligingly proposed to carry me to see Islam, a romantick scene, now belonging to a family of the name of Port, but formerly the seat of the Congreves. I suppose it is well described in some of the Tours. Johnson described it distinctly and vividly, at which I could not but express to him my wonder; because, though my eyes, as he observed, were better than his, I could not by any means equal him in representing visible objects. I said, the difference between us in this respect was as that between a man who has a bad instrument, but plays well on it, and a man who has a good instrument, on which he can play very imperfectly.</p>
<p class="p24">I recollect a very fine amphitheatre, surrounded with hills covered with woods, and walks neatly formed along the side of a rocky steep, on the quarter next the house, with recesses under projections of rock, overshadowed with trees; in one of which recesses, we were told, Congreve wrote his <span class="t8">Old Bachelor</span>. We viewed a remarkable natural curiosity at Islam; two rivers bursting near each other from the rock, not from immediate springs, but after having run for many miles under ground. Plott, in his <span class="t8">History of Staffordshire</span>, gives an account of this curiosity; but Johnson would not believe it, though we had the attestation of the gardener, who said, he had put in corks, where the river <span class="t8">Manyfold</span> sinks into the ground, and had catched them in a net, placed before one of the openings where the water bursts out. Indeed, such subterraneous courses of water are found in various parts of our globe.</p>
<p class="p24">Talking of Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s unwillingness to believe extraordinary things, I ventured to say, &lsquo;Sir, you come near Hume&rsquo;s argument against miracles, &ldquo;That it is more probable witnesses should lie, or be mistaken, than that they should happen.&rdquo;&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, Hume, taking the proposition simply, is right. But the Christian revelation is not proved by the miracles alone, but as connected with prophecies, and with the doctrines in confirmation of which the miracles were wrought.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He repeated his observation, that the differences among Christians are really of no consequence. &lsquo;For instance, (said he,) if a Protestant objects to a Papist, &ldquo;You worship images;&rdquo; the Papist can answer, &ldquo;I do not insist on <span class="t8">your</span> doing it; you may be a very good Papist without it: I do it only as a help to my devotion.&rdquo;&rsquo; I said, the great article of Christianity is the revelation of immortality. Johnson admitted it was.</p>
<p class="p24">In the evening, a gentleman-farmer, who was on a visit at Dr. Taylor&rsquo;s, attempted to dispute with Johnson in favour of Mungo Campbell, who shot Alexander, Earl of Eglintoune upon his having fallen, when retreating from his Lordship, who he believed was about to seize his gun, as he had threatened to do. He said, he should have done just as Campbell did. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Whoever would do as Campbell did, deserves to be hanged; not that I could, as a juryman, have found him legally guilty of murder; but I am glad they found means to convict him.&rsquo; The gentleman-farmer said, &lsquo;A poor man has as much honour as a rich man; and Campbell had <span class="t8">that</span> to defend.&rsquo; Johnson exclaimed, &lsquo;A poor man has no honour.&rsquo; The English yeoman, not dismayed, proceeded: &lsquo;Lord Eglintoune was a damned fool to run on upon Campbell, after being warned that Campbell would shoot him if he did.&rsquo; Johnson, who could not bear any thing like swearing, angrily replied, &lsquo;He was <span class="t8">not</span> a <span class="t8">damned</span> fool: he only thought too well of Campbell. He did not believe Campbell would be such a <span class="t8">damned</span> scoundrel, as to do so <span class="t8">damned</span> a thing.&rsquo; His emphasis on <span class="t8">damned</span>, accompanied with frowning looks, reproved his opponent&rsquo;s want of decorum in <span class="t8">his</span> presence.</p>
<p class="p24">Talking of the danger of being mortified by rejection, when making approaches to the acquaintance of the great, I observed: &lsquo;I am, however, generally for trying, &ldquo;Nothing venture, nothing have.&rdquo;&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Very true, Sir; but I have always been more afraid of failing, than hopeful of success.&rsquo; And, indeed, though he had all just respect for rank, no man ever less courted the favour of the great.</p>
<p class="p24">During this interview at Ashbourne, Johnson seemed to be more uniformly social, cheerful, and alert, than I had almost ever seen him. He was prompt on great occasions and on small. Taylor, who praised every thing of his own to excess; in short, &lsquo;whose geese were all swans,&rsquo; as the proverb says, expatiated on the excellence of his bull-dog, which, he told us, was &lsquo;perfectly well shaped.&rsquo; Johnson, after examining the animal attentively, thus repressed the vain-glory of our host:&mdash; &lsquo;No, Sir, he is <span class="t8">not</span> well shaped; for there is not the quick transition from the thickness of the fore-part, to the <span class="t8">tenuity</span> &mdash; the thin part &mdash; behind, &mdash; which a bull-dog ought to have.&rsquo; This <span class="t8">tenuity</span> was the only <span class="t8">hard word</span> that I heard him use during this interview, and it will be observed, he instantly put another expression in its place. Taylor said, a small bull-dog was as good as a large one. JOHNSON, &lsquo;No, Sir; for, in proportion to his size, he has strength: and your argument would prove, that a good bull-dog may be as small as a mouse.&rsquo; It was amazing how he entered with perspicuity and keenness upon every thing that occurred in conversation. Most men, whom I know, would no more think of discussing a question about a bull-dog, than of attacking a bull.</p>
<p class="p24">I cannot allow any fragment whatever that floats in my memory concerning the great subject of this work to be lost. Though a small particular may appear trifling to some, it will be relished by others; while every little spark adds something to the general blaze: and to please the true, candid, warm admirers of Johnson, and in any degree increase the splendour of his reputation, I bid defiance to the shafts of ridicule, or even of malignity. Showers of them have been discharged at my <span class="t8">Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides</span>; yet it still sails unhurt along the stream of time, and, as an attendant upon Johnson,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Pursues the triumph, and partakes the gale.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">One morning after breakfast, when the sun shone bright, we walked out together, and &lsquo;pored&rsquo; for some time with placid indolence upon an artificial water-fall, which Dr. Taylor had made by building a strong dyke of stone across the river behind the garden. It was now somewhat obstructed by branches of trees and other rubbish, which had come down the river, and settled close to it. Johnson, partly from a desire to see it play more freely, and partly from that inclination to activity which will animate, at times, the most inert and sluggish mortal, took a long pole which was lying on a bank, and pushed down several parcels of this wreck with painful assiduity, while I stood quietly by, wondering to behold the sage thus curiously employed, and smiling with an humorous satisfaction each time when he carried his point. He worked till he was quite out of breath; and having found a large dead cat so heavy that he could not move it after several efforts, &lsquo;Come,&rsquo; said he, (throwing down the pole,) &lsquo;<span class="t8">you</span> shall take it now;&rsquo; which I accordingly did, and being a fresh man, soon made the cat tumble over the cascade. This may be laughed at as too trifling to record; but it is a small characteristick trait in the Flemish picture which I give of my friend, and in which, therefore, I mark the most minute particulars. And let it be remembered, that <span class="t8">Æsop at play</span> is one of the instructive apologues of antiquity.</p>
<p class="p24">I mentioned an old gentleman of our acquaintance whose memory was beginning to fail. JOHNSON. &lsquo;There must be a diseased mind, where there is a failure of memory at seventy. A man&rsquo;s head, Sir, must be morbid, if he fails so soon.&rsquo; My friend, being now himself sixty-eight, might think thus: but I imagine, that <span class="t8">threescore and ten</span>, the Psalmist&rsquo;s period of sound human life in later ages, may have a failure, though there be no disease in the constitution.</p>
<p class="p24">Talking of Rochester&rsquo;s Poems, he said, he had given them to Mr. Steevens to castrate for the edition of the poets, to which he was to write Prefaces. Dr. Taylor (the only time I ever heard him say any thing witty) observed, that &lsquo;if Rochester had been castrated himself, his exceptionable poems would not have been written.&rsquo; I asked if Burnet had not given a good Life of Rochester. JOHNSON. &lsquo;We have a good <span class="t8">Death</span>: there is not much <span class="t8">Life</span>.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I asked whether Prior&rsquo;s Poems were to be printed entire: Johnson said they were. I mentioned Lord Hailes&rsquo;s censure of Prior, in his Preface to a collection of <span class="t8">Sacred Poems</span>, by various hands, published by him at Edinburgh a great many years ago, where he mentions, &lsquo;those impure tales which will be the eternal opprobrium of their ingenious authour.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, Lord Hailes has forgot. There is nothing in Prior that will excite to lewdness. If Lord Hailes thinks there is, he must be more combustible than other people.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I instanced the tale of <span class="t8">Paulo Purganti and his Wife</span>. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, there is nothing there, but that his wife wanted to be kissed when poor Paulo was out of pocket. No, Sir, Prior is a lady&rsquo;s book. No lady is ashamed to have it standing in her library.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">The hypochondriack disorder being mentioned, Dr. Johnson did not think it so common as I supposed. &lsquo;Dr. Taylor (said he) is the same one day as another. Burke and Reynolds are the same; Beauclerk, except when in pain, is the same. I am not so myself; but this I do not mention commonly.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I complained of a wretched changefulness, so that I could not preserve, for any long continuance, the same views of any thing. It was most comfortable to me to experience, in Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s company, a relief from this uneasiness. His steady vigorous mind held firm before me those objects which my own feeble and tremulous imagination frequently presented, in such a wavering state, that my reason could not judge well of them.</p>
<p class="p24">Dr. Johnson advised me to-day, to have as many books about me as I could; that I might read upon any subject upon which I had a desire for instruction at the time. &lsquo;What you read <span class="t8">then</span> (said he) you will remember; but if you have not a book immediately ready, and the subject moulds in your mind, it is a chance if you again have a desire to study it.&rsquo; He added, &lsquo;If a man never has an eager desire for instruction, he should prescribe a task for himself. But it is better when a man reads from immediate inclination.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He repeated a good many lines of Horace&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Odes</span>, while we were in the chaise. I remember particularly the Ode <span class="t8">Eheu fugaces</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">He said, the dispute as to the comparative excellence of Homer or Virgil was inaccurate. &lsquo;We must consider (said he) whether Homer was not the greatest poet, though Virgil may have produced the finest poem. Virgil was indebted to Homer for the whole invention of the structure of an epick poem, and for many of his beauties.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He told me that Bacon was a favourite authour with him; but he had never read his works till he was compiling the <span class="t8">English Dictionary</span>, in which, he said, I might see Bacon very often quoted. Mr. Seward recollects his having mentioned, that a Dictionary of the English Language might be compiled from Bacon&rsquo;s writings alone, and that he had once an intention of giving an edition of Bacon, at least of his English works, and writing the Life of that great man. Had he executed this intention, there can be no doubt that he would have done it in a most masterly manner. Mallet&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Life of Bacon</span> has no inconsiderable merit as an acute and elegant dissertation relative to its subject; but Mallet&rsquo;s mind was not comprehensive enough to embrace the vast extent of Lord Verulam&rsquo;s genius and research. Dr. Warburton therefore observed, with witty justness, &lsquo;that Mallet, in his <span class="t8">Life of Bacon</span>, had forgotten that he was a philosopher; and if he should write the Life of the Duke of Marlborough, which he had undertaken to do, he would probably forget that he was a general.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Wishing to be satisfied what degree of truth there was in a story which a friend of Johnson&rsquo;s and mine had told me to his disadvantage, I mentioned it to him in direct terms; and it was to this effect: that a gentleman who had lived in great intimacy with him, shewn him much kindness, and even relieved him from a spunging-house, having afterwards fallen into bad circumstances, was one day, when Johnson was at dinner with him, seized for debt, and carried to prison; that Johnson sat still undisturbed, and went on eating and drinking; upon which the gentleman&rsquo;s sister, who was present, could not suppress her indignation: &lsquo;What, Sir, (said she,) are you so unfeeling, as not even to offer to go to my brother in his distress; you who have been so much obliged to him?&rsquo; And that Johnson answered, &lsquo;Madam, I owe him no obligation; what he did for me he would have done for a dog.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson assured me, that the story was absolutely false: but like a man conscious of being in the right, and desirous of completely vindicating himself from such a charge, he did not arrogantly rest on a mere denial, and on his general character, but proceeded thus:&mdash; &lsquo;Sir, I was very intimate with that gentleman, and was once relieved by him from an arrest; but I never was present when he was arrested, never knew that he was arrested, and I believe he never was in difficulties after the time when he relieved me. I loved him much; yet, in talking of his general character, I may have said, though I do not remember that I ever did say so, that as his generosity proceeded from no principle, but was a part of his profusion, he would do for a dog what he would do for a friend: but I never applied this remark to any particular instance, and certainly not to his kindness to me. If a profuse man, who does not value his money, and gives a large sum to a whore, gives half as much, or an equally large sum to relieve a friend, it cannot be esteemed as virtue. This was all that I could say of that gentleman; and, if said at all, it must have been said after his death. Sir, I would have gone to the world&rsquo;s end to relieve him. The remark about the dog, if made by me, was such a sally as might escape one when painting a man highly.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Tuesday, September 23, Johnson was remarkably cordial to me. It being necessary for me to return to Scotland soon, I had fixed on the next day for my setting out, and I felt a tender concern at the thought of parting with him. He had, at this time, frankly communicated to me many particulars, which are inserted in this work in their proper places; and once, when I happened to mention that the expence of my jaunt would come to much more than I had computed, he said, &lsquo;Why, Sir, if the expence were to be an inconvenience, you would have reason to regret it: but, if you have had the money to spend, I know not that you could have purchased as much pleasure with it in any other way.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">During this interview at Ashbourne, Johnson and I frequently talked with wonderful pleasure of mere trifles which had occurred in our tour to the Hebrides; for it had left a most agreeable and lasting impression upon his mind.</p>
<p class="p24">He found fault with me for using the phrase to <span class="t8">make</span> money. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you see (said he) the impropriety of it? To <span class="t8">make</span> money is to <span class="t8">coin</span> it: you should say <span class="t8">get</span> money.&rsquo; The phrase, however, is, I think, pretty current. But Johnson was at all times jealous of infractions upon the genuine English language, and prompt to repress colloquial barbarisms; such as, <span class="t8">pledging myself</span>, for <span class="t8">undertaking</span>; <span class="t8">line</span>, for <span class="t8">department</span>, or <span class="t8">branch</span>, as, the <span class="t8">civil line</span>, the <span class="t8">banking line</span>. He was particularly indignant against the almost universal use of the word <span class="t8">idea</span> in the sense of <span class="t8">notion</span> or <span class="t8">opinion</span>, when it is clear that <span class="t8">idea</span> can only signify something of which an image can be formed in the mind. We may have an <span class="t8">idea</span> or <span class="t8">image</span> of a mountain, a tree, a building; but we cannot surely have an <span class="t8">idea</span> or <span class="t8">image</span> of an <span class="t8">argument</span> or <span class="t8">proposition</span>. Yet we hear the sages of the law &lsquo;delivering their <span class="t8">ideas</span> upon the question under consideration;&rsquo; and the first speakers in parliament &lsquo;entirely coinciding in the <span class="t8">idea</span> which has been ably stated by an honourable member;&rsquo; &mdash; or &lsquo;reprobating an <span class="t8">idea</span> unconstitutional, and fraught with the most dangerous consequences to a great and free country.&rsquo; Johnson called this &lsquo;modern cant.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I perceived that he pronounced the word <span class="t8">heard</span>, as if spelt with a double <span class="t8">e, heerd</span>, instead of sounding it <span class="t8">herd</span>, as is most usually done. He said, his reason was, that if it was pronounced <span class="t8">herd</span>, there would be a single exception from the English pronunciation of the syllable <span class="t8">ear</span>, and he thought it better not to have that exception.</p>
<p class="p24">He praised Grainger&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Ode on Solitude</span>, in Dodsley&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Collection</span>, and repeated, with great energy, the exordium: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;O Solitude, romantick maid,<br/>Whether by nodding towers you tread;<br/>Or haunt the desart&rsquo;s trackless gloom,<br/>Or hover o&rsquo;er the yawning tomb;<br/>Or climb the Andes&rsquo; clifted side,<br/>Or by the Nile&rsquo;s coy source abide;<br/>Or, starting from your half-year&rsquo;s sleep,<br/>From Hecla view the thawing deep;<br/>Or, at the purple dawn of day,<br/>Tadnor&rsquo;s marble waste survey&rsquo;;</p>
<p class="p24">observing, &lsquo;This, Sir, is very noble.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">In the evening our gentleman-farmer, and two others, entertained themselves and the company with a great number of tunes on the fiddle. Johnson desired to have &lsquo;Let ambition fire thy mind,&rsquo; played over again, and appeared to give a patient attention to it; though he owned to me that he was very insensible to the power of musick. I told him, that it affected me to such a degree, as often to agitate my nerves painfully, producing in my mind alternate sensations of pathetick dejection, so that I was ready to shed tears; and of daring resolution, so that I was inclined to rush into the thickest part of the battle. &lsquo;Sir, (said he,) I should never hear it, if it made me such a fool.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Much of the effect of musick, I am satisfied, is owing to the association of ideas. That air, which instantly and irresistibly excites in the Swiss, when in a foreign land, the <span class="t8">maladie du pais</span>, has, I am told, no intrinsick power of sound. And I know from my own experience, that Scotch reels, though brisk, make me melancholy, because I used to hear them in my early years, at a time when Mr. Pitt called for soldiers &lsquo;from the mountains of the north,&rsquo; and numbers of brave Highlanders were going abroad, never to return. Whereas the airs in <span class="t8">The Beggar&rsquo;s Opera</span>, many of which are very soft, never fail to render me gay, because they are associated with the warm sensations and high spirits of London. This evening, while some of the tunes of ordinary composition were played with no great skill, my frame was agitated, and I was conscious of a generous attachment to Dr. Johnson, as my preceptor and friend, mixed with an affectionate regret that he was an old man, whom I should probably lose in a short time. I thought I could defend him at the point of my sword. My reverence and affection for him were in full glow. I said to him, &lsquo;My dear Sir, we must meet every year, if you don&rsquo;t quarrel with me.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Nay, Sir, you are more likely to quarrel with me, than I with you. My regard for you is greater almost than I have words to express; but I do not choose to be always repeating it; write it down in the first leaf of your pocket-book, and never doubt of it again.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I talked to him of misery being &lsquo;the doom of man&rsquo; in this life, as displayed in his <span class="t8">Vanity of Human Wishes</span>&rsquo;. Yet I observed that things were done upon the supposition of happiness; grand houses were built, fine gardens were made, splendid places of publick amusement were contrived, and crowded with company. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Alas, Sir, these are all only struggles for happiness. When I first entered Ranelagh, it gave an expansion and gay sensation to my mind, such as I never experienced any where else. But, as Xerxes wept when he viewed his immense army, and considered that not one of that great multitude would be alive a hundred years afterwards, so it went to my heart to consider that there was not one in all that brilliant circle, that was not afraid to go home and think; but that the thoughts of each individual there, would be distressing when alone.&rsquo; This reflection was experimentally just. The feeling of languor, which succeeds the animation of gaiety, is itself a very severe pain; and when the mind is then vacant, a thousand disappointments and vexations rush in and excruciate. Will not many even of my fairest readers allow this to be true?</p>
<p class="p24">I suggested, that being in love, and flattered with hopes of success; or having some favourite scheme in view for the next day, might prevent that wretchedness of which we had been talking. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, it may sometimes be so as you suppose; but my conclusion is in general but too true.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">While Johnson and I stood in calm conference by ourselves in Dr. Taylor&rsquo;s garden, at a pretty late hour in a serene autumn night, looking up to the heavens, I directed the discourse to the subject of a future state. My friend was in a placid and most benignant frame. &lsquo;Sir, (said he,) I do not imagine that all things will be made clear to us immediately after death, but that the ways of Providence will be explained to us very gradually.&rsquo; I ventured to ask him whether, although the words of some texts of Scripture seemed strong in support of the dreadful doctrine of an eternity of punishment, we might not hope that the denunciation was figurative, and would not literally be executed. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, you are to consider the intention of punishment in a future state. We have no reason to be sure that we shall then be no longer liable to offend against GOD. We do not know that even the angels are quite in a state of security; nay we know that some of them have fallen. It may, therefore, perhaps be necessary, in order to preserve both men and angels in a state of rectitude, that they should have continually before them the punishment of those who have deviated from it; but we may hope that by some other means a fall from rectitude may be prevented. Some of the texts of Scripture upon this subject are, as you observe, indeed strong; but they may admit of a mitigated interpretation.&rsquo; He talked to me upon this awful and delicate question in a gentle tone, and as if afraid to be decisive.</p>
<p class="p24">After supper I accompanied him to his apartment, and at my request he dictated to me an argument in favour of the negro who was then claiming his liberty, in an action in the Court of Session in Scotland. He had always been very zealous against slavery in every form, in which I, with all deference, thought that he discovered &lsquo;a zeal without knowledge.&rsquo; Upon one occasion, when in company with some very grave men at Oxford, his toast was, &lsquo;Here&rsquo;s to the next insurrection of the negroes in the West Indies.&rsquo; His violent prejudice against our West Indian and American settlers appeared whenever there was an opportunity. Towards the conclusion of his <span class="t8">Taxation no Tyranny</span>, he says, &lsquo;how is it that we hear the loudest <span class="t8">yelps</span> for liberty among the drivers of negroes?&rsquo; and in his conversation with Mr. Wilkes, he asked, &lsquo;Where did Beckford and Trecothick learn English?&rsquo; That Trecothick could both speak and write good English is well known. I myself was favoured with his correspondence concerning the brave Corsicans. And that Beckford could speak it with a spirit of honest resolution even to his Majesty, as his &lsquo;faithful Lord-Mayor of London,&rsquo; is commemorated by the noble monument erected to him in Guildhall.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">The argument dictated by Dr. Johnson was as follows: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;It must be agreed that in most ages many countries have had part of their inhabitants in a state of slavery; yet it may be doubted whether slavery can ever be supposed the natural condition of man. It is impossible not to conceive that men in their original state were equal; and very difficult to imagine how one would be subjected to another but by violent compulsion. An individual may, indeed, forfeit his liberty by a crime; but he cannot by that crime forfeit the liberty of his children. What is true of a criminal seems true likewise of a captive. A man may accept life from a conquering enemy on condition of perpetual servitude; but it is very doubtful whether he can entail that servitude on his descendants; for no man can stipulate without commission for another. The condition which he himself accepts, his son or grandson perhaps would have rejected. If we should admit, what perhaps may with more reason be denied, that there are certain relations between man and man which may make slavery necessary and just, yet it can never be proved that he who is now suing for his freedom ever stood in any of those relations. He is certainly subject by no law, but that of violence, to his present master; who pretends no claim to his obedience, but that he bought him from a merchant of slaves, whose right to sell him never was examined. It is said that, according to the constitutions of Jamaica, he was legally enslaved; these constitutions are merely positive; and apparently injurious to the rights of mankind, because whoever is exposed to sale is condemned to slavery without appeal; by whatever fraud or violence he might have been originally brought into the merchant&rsquo;s power. In our own time Princes have been sold, by wretches to whose care they were entrusted, that they might have an European education; but when once they were brought to a market in the plantations, little would avail either their dignity or their wrongs. The laws of Jamaica afford a Negro no redress. His colour is considered as a sufficient testimony against him. It is to be lamented that moral right should ever give way to political convenience. But if temptations of interest are sometimes too strong for human virtue, let us at least retain a virtue where there is no temptation to quit it. In the present case there is apparent right on one side, and no convenience on the other. Inhabitants of this island can neither gain riches nor power by taking away the liberty of any part of the human species. The sum of the argument is this: &mdash; No man is by nature the property of another: The defendant is, therefore, by nature free: The rights of nature must be some way forfeited before they can be justly taken away: That the defendant has by any act forfeited the rights of nature we require to be proved; and if no proof of such forfeiture can be given, we doubt not but the justice of the court will declare him free.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I record Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s argument fairly upon this particular case; where, perhaps, he was in the right. But I beg leave to enter my most solemn protest against his general doctrine with respect to the <span class="t8">Slave Trade</span>. For I will resolutely say &mdash; that his unfavourable notion of it was owing to prejudice, and imperfect or false information. The wild and dangerous attempt which has for some time been persisted in to obtain an act of our Legislature, to abolish so very important and necessary a branch of commercial interest, must have been crushed at once, had not the insignificance of the zealots who vainly took the lead in it, made the vast body of Planters, Merchants, and others, whose immense properties are involved in that trade, reasonably enough suppose that there could be no danger. The encouragement which the attempt has received excites my wonder and indignation: and though some men of superiour abilities have supported it; whether from a love of temporary popularity, when prosperous; or a love of general mischief, when desperate, my opinion is unshaken. To abolish a <span class="t8">status</span>, which in all ages GOD has sanctioned, and man has continued, would not only be <span class="t8">robbery</span> to an innumerable class of our fellow-subjects; but it would be extreme cruelty to the African Savages, a portion of whom it saves from massacre, or intolerable bondage in their own country, and introduces into a much happier state of life; especially now when their passage to the West-Indies and their treatment there is humanely regulated. To abolish that trade would be to</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo; &mdash; shut the gates of mercy on mankind&rsquo;.</p>
<p class="p24">Whatever may have passed elsewhere concerning it, the HOUSE OF LORDS is wise and independent:</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Intaminatis fulget honoribus; Nec sumit aut ponit secures Arbitrio popularis auræ</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">I have read, conversed, and thought much upon the subject, and would recommend to all who are capable of conviction, an excellent Tract by my learned and ingenious friend John Ranby, Esq., entitled <span class="t8">Doubts on the Abolition of the Slave Trade</span>. To Mr. Ranby&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Doubts</span> I will apply Lord Chancellor Hardwicke&rsquo;s expression in praise of a Scotch Law Book, called <span class="t8">Dirletons Doubts</span>; HIS <span class="t8">Doubts</span>, (said his Lordship,) are better than most people&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Certainties</span>.</p>
<p class="p26">When I said now to Johnson, that I was afraid I kept him too late up.<br/>&lsquo;No, Sir, (said he,) I don&rsquo;t care though I sit all night with you.&rsquo;<br/>This was an animated speech from a man in his sixty-ninth year.</p>
<p class="p24">Had I been as attentive not to displease him as I ought to have been, I know not but this vigil might have been fulfilled; but I unluckily entered upon the controversy concerning the right of Great-Britain to tax America, and attempted to argue in favour of our fellow-subjects on the other side of the Atlantick. I insisted that America might be very well governed, and made to yield sufficient revenue by the means of <span class="t8">influence</span>, as exemplified in Ireland, while the people might be pleased with the imagination of their participating of the British constitution, by having a body of representatives, without whose consent money could not be exacted from them. Johnson could not bear my thus opposing his avowed opinion, which he had exerted himself with an extreme degree of heat to enforce; and the violent agitation into which he was thrown, while answering, or rather reprimanding me, alarmed me so, that I heartily repented of my having unthinkingly introduced the subject. I myself, however, grew warm, and the change was great, from the calm state of philosophical discussion in which we had a little before been pleasingly employed.</p>
<p class="p24">I talked of the corruption of the British Parliament, in which I alleged that any question, however unreasonable or unjust, might be carried by a venal majority; and I spoke with high admiration of the Roman Senate, as if composed of men sincerely desirous to resolve what they should think best for their country. My friend would allow no such character to the Roman Senate; and he maintained that the British Parliament was not corrupt, and that there was no occasion to corrupt its members; asserting, that there was hardly ever any question of great importance before Parliament, any question in which a man might not very well vote either upon one side or the other. He said there had been none in his time except that respecting America.</p>
<p class="p24">We were fatigued by the contest, which was produced by my want of caution; and he was not then in the humour to slide into easy and cheerful talk. It therefore so happened, that we were after an hour or two very willing to separate and go to bed.</p>
<p class="p24">On Wednesday, September 24, I went into Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s room before he got up, and finding that the storm of the preceding night was quite laid, I sat down upon his bed-side, and he talked with as much readiness and good-humour as ever. He recommended to me to plant a considerable part of a large moorish farm which I had purchased, and he made several calculations of the expence and profit: for he delighted in exercising his mind on the science of numbers. He pressed upon me the importance of planting at the first in a very sufficient manner, quoting the saying &lsquo;<span class="t8">In bello non licet bis errare</span>:&rsquo; and adding, &lsquo;this is equally true in planting.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I spoke with gratitude of Dr. Taylor&rsquo;s hospitality; and, as evidence that it was not on account of his good table alone that Johnson visited him often, I mentioned a little anecdote which had escaped my friend&rsquo;s recollection, and at hearing which repeated, he smiled. One evening, when I was sitting with him, Frank delivered this message: &lsquo;Sir, Dr. Taylor sends his compliments to you, and begs you will dine with him to-morrow. He has got a hare.&rsquo;&mdash; &lsquo;My compliments (said Johnson) and I&rsquo;ll dine with him &mdash; hare or rabbit.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">After breakfast I departed, and pursued my journey northwards. I took my post-chaise from the Green Man, a very good inn at Ashbourne, the mistress of which, a mighty civil gentlewoman, courtseying very low, presented me with an engraving of the sign of her house; to which she had subjoined, in her own hand-writing, an address in such singular simplicity of style, that I have preserved it pasted upon one of the boards of my original Journal at this time, and shall here insert it for the amusement of my readers: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;<span class="t8">M. KILLINGLEY&rsquo;s duty waits upon</span> Mr. Boswell, <span class="t8">is exceedingly obliged to him for this favour; whenever he comes this way, hopes for a continuance of the same. Would</span> Mr. Boswell name the house to his extensive acquaintance, it would be a singular favour conferr&rsquo;d on one who has it not in her power to make any other return but her most grateful thanks, and sincerest prayers for his happiness in time, and in a blessed eternity.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Tuesday morn.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">From this meeting at Ashbourne I derived a considerable accession to my Johnsonian store. I communicated my original Journal to Sir William Forbes, in whom I have always placed deserved confidence; and what he wrote to me concerning it is so much to my credit as the biographer of Johnson, that my readers will, I hope, grant me their indulgence for here inserting it: &lsquo;It is not once or twice going over it (says Sir William,) that will satisfy me; for I find in it a high degree of instruction as well as entertainment; and I derive more benefit from Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s admirable discussions than I should be able to draw from his personal conversation; for, I suppose there is not a man in the world to whom he discloses his sentiments so freely as to yourself.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I cannot omit a curious circumstance which occurred at Edensor-inn, close by Chatsworth, to survey the magnificence of which I had gone a considerable way out of my road to Scotland. The inn was then kept by a very jolly landlord, whose name, I think, was Malton. He happened to mention that &lsquo;the celebrated Dr. Johnson had been in his house.&rsquo; I inquired <span class="t8">who</span> this Dr. Johnson was, that I might hear mine host&rsquo;s notion of him. &lsquo;Sir, (said he,) Johnson, the great writer; <span class="t8">Oddity</span>, as they call him. He&rsquo;s the greatest writer in England; he writes for the ministry; he has a correspondence abroad, and lets them know what&rsquo;s going on.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">My friend, who had a thorough dependance upon the authenticity of my relation without any <span class="t8">embellishment</span>, as <span class="t8">falsehood</span> or <span class="t8">fiction</span> is too gently called, laughed a good deal at this representation of himself.</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">&lsquo;MR. BOSWELL TO DR. JOHNSON.</span></p>
<p class="p21">&lsquo;Edinburgh, Sept. 29, 1777.</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">&lsquo;MY DEAR SIR,</span></p>
<p class="p21">&lsquo;By the first post I inform you of my safe arrival at my own house, and that I had the comfort of finding my wife and children all in good health.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;When I look back upon our late interview, it appears to me to have answered expectation better than almost any scheme of happiness that I ever put in execution. My Journal is stored with wisdom and wit; and my memory is filled with the recollection of lively and affectionate feelings, which now, I think, yield me more satisfaction than at the time when they were first excited. I have experienced this upon other occasions. I shall be obliged to you if you will explain it to me; for it seems wonderful that pleasure should be more vivid at a distance than when near. I wish you may find yourself in a humour to do me this favour; but I flatter myself with no strong hope of it; for I have observed, that unless upon very serious occasions, your letters to me are not answers to those which I write.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">[I then expressed much uneasiness that I had mentioned to him the name of the gentleman who had told me the story so much to his disadvantage, the truth of which he had completely refuted; for that my having done so might be interpreted as a breach of confidence, and offend one whose society I valued: &mdash; therefore earnestly requesting that no notice might be taken of it to anybody, till I should be in London, and have an opportunity to talk it over with the gentleman.]</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To JAMES BOSWELL, ESQ.</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;You will wonder, or you have wondered, why no letter has come from me. What you wrote at your return, had in it such a strain of cowardly caution as gave me no pleasure. I could not well do what you wished; I had no need to vex you with a refusal. I have seen Mr. &mdash;&mdash; , and as to him have set all right, without any inconvenience, so far as I know, to you. Mrs. Thrale had forgot the story. You may now be at ease.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;And at ease I certainly wish you, for the kindness that you showed in coming so long a journey to see me. It was pity to keep you so long in pain, but, upon reviewing the matter, I do not see what I could have done better than as I did.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I hope you found at your return my dear enemy and all her little people quite well, and had no reason to repent of your journey. I think on it with great gratitude.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I was not well when you left me at the Doctor&rsquo;s, and I grew worse; yet I staid on, and at Lichfield was very ill. Travelling, however, did not make me worse; and when I came to London, I complied with a summons to go to Brighthelmston, where I saw Beauclerk, and staid three days.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Our CLUB has recommenced last Friday, but I was not there. Langton has another wench. Mrs. Thrale is in hopes of a young brewer. They got by their trade last year a very large sum, and their expenses are proportionate.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Mrs. Williams&rsquo;s health is very bad. And I have had for some time a very difficult and laborious respiration; but I am better by purges, abstinence, and other methods. I am yet, however, much behind hand in my health and rest.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Dr. Blair&rsquo;s Sermons are now universally commended; but let him think that I had the honour of first finding and first praising his excellencies. I did not stay to add my voice to that of the publick.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;My dear friend, let me thank you once more for your visit; you did me great honour, and I hope met with nothing that displeased you. I staid long at Ashbourne, not much pleased, yet aukward at departing. I then went to Lichfield, where I found my friend at Stow-hill very dangerously diseased. Such is life. Let us try to pass it well, whatever it be, for there is surely something beyond it.</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;Well, now I hope all is well, write as soon as you can to, dear Sir,<br/>&lsquo;Your affectionate servant,<br/>&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;<br/>&lsquo;London, Nov. 25, 1777.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p26">&lsquo;To DR. SAMUEL JOHNSON.<br/>&lsquo;Edinburgh, Nov. 29, 1777.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;My DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;This day&rsquo;s post has at length relieved me from much uneasiness, by bringing me a letter from you. I was, indeed, doubly uneasy; &mdash; on my own account and yours. I was very anxious to be secured against any bad consequences from my imprudence in mentioning the gentleman&rsquo;s name who had told me a story to your disadvantage; and as I could hardly suppose it possible, that you would delay so long to make me easy, unless you were ill, I was not a little apprehensive about you. You must not be offended when I venture to tell you that you appear to me to have been too rigid upon this occasion. The &ldquo;<span class="t8">cowardly caution which gave you no pleasure</span>,&rdquo; was suggested to me by a friend here, to whom I mentioned the strange story and the detection of its falsity, as an instance how one may be deceived by what is apparently very good authority. But, as I am still persuaded, that as I might have obtained the truth, without mentioning the gentleman&rsquo;s name, it was wrong in me to do it, I cannot see that you are just in blaming my caution. But if you were ever so just in your disapprobation, might you not have dealt more tenderly with me?</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I went to Auchinleck about the middle of October, and passed some time with my father very comfortably.</p>
<p class="p10">* * * * *</p>
<p class="p21">&lsquo;I am engaged in a criminal prosecution against a country schoolmaster, for indecent behaviour to his female scholars. There is no statute against such abominable conduct; but it is punishable at common law. I shall be obliged to you for your assistance in this extraordinary trial. I ever am, my dear Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your faithful humble servant,</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;JAMES BOSWELL.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">About this time I wrote to Johnson, giving him an account of the decision of the <span class="t8">Negro cause</span>, by the court of Session, which by those who hold even the mildest and best regulated slavery in abomination, (of which number I do not hesitate to declare that I am none,) should be remembered with high respect, and to the credit of Scotland; for it went upon a much broader ground than the case of <span class="t8">Somerset</span>, which was decided in England; being truly the general question, whether a perpetual obligation of service to one master in any mode should be sanctified by the law of a free country. A negro, then called <span class="t8">Joseph Knight</span>, a native of Africa, who having been brought to Jamaica in the usual course of the slave trade, and purchased by a Scotch gentleman in that island, had attended his master to Scotland, where it was officiously suggested to him that he would be found entitled to his liberty without any limitation. He accordingly brought his action, in the course of which the advocates on both sides did themselves great honour. Mr. Maclaurin has had the praise of Johnson, for his argument in favour of the negro, and Mr. Macconochie distinguished himself on the same side, by his ingenuity and extraordinary research. Mr. Cullen, on the part of the master, discovered good information and sound reasoning; in which he was well supported by Mr. James Ferguson, remarkable for a manly understanding, and a knowledge both of books and of the world. But I cannot too highly praise the speech which Mr. Henry Dundas generously contributed to the cause of the sooty stranger. Mr. Dundas&rsquo;s Scottish accent, which has been so often in vain obtruded as an objection to his powerful abilities in parliament, was no disadvantage to him in his own country. And I do declare, that upon this memorable question he impressed me, and I believe all his audience, with such feelings as were produced by some of the most eminent orations of antiquity. This testimony I liberally give to the excellence of an old friend, with whom it has been my lot to differ very widely upon many political topicks; yet I persuade myself without malice. A great majority of the Lords of Session decided for the negro. But four of their number, the Lord President, Lord Elliock, Lord Monboddo, and Lord Covington, resolutely maintained the lawfulness of a status, which has been acknowledged in all ages and countries, and that when freedom flourished, as in old Greece and Rome.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To JAMES BOSWELL, ESQ.</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;This is the time of the year in which all express their good wishes to their friends, and I send mine to you and your family. May your lives be long, happy, and good. I have been much out of order, but, I hope, do not grow worse.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The crime of the schoolmaster whom you are engaged to prosecute is very great, and may be suspected to be too common. In our law it would be a breach of the peace, and a misdemeanour: that is, a kind of indefinite crime, not capital, but punishable at the discretion of the Court. You cannot want matter: all that needs to be said will easily occur.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Mr. Shaw, the author of the <span class="t8">Gaelick Grammar</span>, desires me to make a request for him to Lord Eglintoune, that he may be appointed Chaplain to one of the new-raised regiments.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;All our friends are as they were; little has happened to them of either good or bad. Mrs. Thrale ran a great black hair-dressing pin into her eye; but by great evacuation she kept it from inflaming, and it is almost well. Miss Reynolds has been out of order, but is better. Mrs. Williams is in a very poor state of health.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;If I should write on, I should, perhaps, write only complaints, and therefore I will content myself with telling you, that I love to think on you, and to hear from you; and that I am, dear Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Yours faithfully,</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;December 27, 1777.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To DR. SAMUEL JOHNSON.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Edinburgh, Jan. 8, 1778.</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your congratulations upon a new year are mixed with complaint: mine must be so too. My wife has for some time been very ill, having been confined to the house these three months by a severe cold, attended with alarming symptoms.</p>

<p class="p24">&lsquo;To JAMES BOSWELL, ESQ.</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To a letter so interesting as your last, it is proper to return some answer, however little I may be disposed to write.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your alarm at your lady&rsquo;s illness was reasonable, and not disproportionate to the appearance of the disorder. I hope your physical friend&rsquo;s conjecture is now verified, and all fear of a consumption at an end: a little care and exercise will then restore her. London is a good air for ladies; and if you bring her hither, I will do for her what she did for me &mdash; I will retire from my apartments, for her accommodation. Behave kindly to her, and keep her cheerful.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;You always seem to call for tenderness. Know then, that in the first month of the present year I very highly esteem and very cordially love you. I hope to tell you this at the beginning of every year as long as we live; and why should we trouble ourselves to tell or hear it oftener?</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Tell Veronica, Euphemia, and Alexander, that I wish them, as well as their parents, many happy years.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;You have ended the negro&rsquo;s cause much to my mind. Lord Auchinleck and dear Lord Hailes were on the side of liberty. Lord Hailes&rsquo;s name reproaches me; but if he saw my languid neglect of my own affairs, he would rather pity than resent my neglect of his. I hope to mend, <span class="t8">ut et mihi vivam et amicis</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am, dear Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your&rsquo;s affectionately,</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;January 24, 1778.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;My service to my fellow-traveller, Joseph.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson maintained a long and intimate friendship with Mr. Welch, who succeeded the celebrated Henry Fielding as one of his Majesty&rsquo;s Justices of the Peace for Westminster; kept a regular office for the police of that great district; and discharged his important trust, for many years, faithfully and ably. Johnson, who had an eager and unceasing curiosity to know human life in all its variety, told me, that he attended Mr. Welch in his office for a whole winter, to hear the examinations of the culprits; but that he found an almost uniform tenor of misfortune, wretchedness and profligacy. Mr. Welch&rsquo;s health being impaired, he was advised to try the effect of a warm climate; and Johnson, by his interest with Mr. Chamier, procured him leave of absence to go to Italy, and a promise that the pension or salary of two hundred pounds a year, which Government allowed him, should not be discontinued. Mr. Welch accordingly went abroad, accompanied by his daughter Anne, a young lady of uncommon talents and literature.</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">&lsquo;TO SAUNDERS WELCH, ESQ., AT THE ENGLISH COFFEE-HOUSE, ROME.</span></p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To have suffered one of my best and dearest friends to pass almost two years in foreign countries without a letter, has a very shameful appearance of inattention. But the truth is, that there was no particular time in which I had any thing particular to say; and general expressions of good will, I hope, our long friendship is grown too solid to want.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Of publick affairs you have information from the news-papers wherever you go, for the English keep no secret; and of other things, Mrs. Nollekens informs you. My intelligence could therefore be of no use; and Miss Nancy&rsquo;s letters made it unnecessary to write to you for information: I was likewise for some time out of humour, to find that motion, and nearer approaches to the sun, did not restore your health so fast as I expected. Of your health, the accounts have lately been more pleasing; and I have the gratification of imaging to myself a length of years which I hope you have gained, and of which the enjoyment will be improved by a vast accession of images and observations which your journeys and various residence have enabled you to make and accumulate. You have travelled with this felicity, almost peculiar to yourself, that your companion is not to part from you at your journey&rsquo;s end; but you are to live on together, to help each other&rsquo;s recollection, and to supply each other&rsquo;s omissions. The world has few greater pleasures than that which two friends enjoy, in tracing back, at some distant time, those transactions and events through which they have passed together. One of the old man&rsquo;s miseries is, that he cannot easily find a companion able to partake with him of the past. You and your fellow-traveller have this comfort in store, that your conversation will be not easily exhausted; one will always be glad to say what the other will always be willing to hear.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;That you may enjoy this pleasure long, your health must have your constant attention. I suppose you purpose to return this year. There is no need of haste: do not come hither before the height of summer, that you may fall gradually into the inconveniences of your native clime. July seems to be the proper month. August and September will prepare you for the winter. After having travelled so far to find health, you must take care not to lose it at home; and I hope a little care will effectually preserve it.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Miss Nancy has doubtless kept a constant and copious journal. She must not expect to be welcome when she returns, without a great mass of information. Let her review her journal often, and set down what she finds herself to have omitted, that she may trust to memory as little as possible, for memory is soon confused by a quick succession of things; and she will grow every day less confident of the truth of her own narratives, unless she can recur to some written memorials. If she has satisfied herself with hints, instead of full representations, let her supply the deficiencies now while her memory is yet fresh, and while her father&rsquo;s memory may help her. If she observes this direction, she will not have travelled in vain; for she will bring home a book with which she may entertain herself to the end of life. If it were not now too late, I would advise her to note the impression which the first sight of any thing new and wonderful made upon her mind. Let her now set her thoughts down as she can recollect them; for faint as they may already be, they will grow every day fainter.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Perhaps I do not flatter myself unreasonably when I imagine that you may wish to know something of me. I can gratify your benevolence with no account of health. The hand of time, or of disease, is very heavy upon me. I pass restless and uneasy nights, harassed with convulsions of my breast, and flatulencies at my stomach; and restless nights make heavy days. But nothing will be mended by complaints, and therefore I will make an end. When we meet, we will try to forget our cares and our maladies, and contribute, as we can, to the chearfulness of each other. If I had gone with you, I believe I should have been better; but I do not know that it was in my power.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am, dear Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your most humble servant,</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">&lsquo;SAM, JOHNSON.&rsquo;</span></p>
<p class="p21">&lsquo;Feb. 3, 1778.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">This letter, while it gives admirable advice how to travel to the best advantage, and will therefore be of very general use, is another eminent proof of Johnson&rsquo;s warm and affectionate heart.</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">&lsquo;TO DR. SAMUEL JOHNSON.</span></p>
<p class="p21">&lsquo;Edinburgh, Feb. 26, 1778.</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">&lsquo;MY DEAR SIR,</span></p>
<p class="p21">&lsquo;Why I have delayed, for near a month, to thank you for your last affectionate letter, I cannot say; for my mind has been in better health these three weeks than for some years past. I believe I have evaded till I could send you a copy of Lord Hailes&rsquo;s opinion on the negro&rsquo;s cause, which he wishes you to read, and correct any errours that there may be in the language; for, says he, &ldquo;we live in a critical, though not a learned age; and I seek to screen myself under the shield of Ajax.&rdquo; I communicated to him your apology for keeping the sheets of his <span class="t8">Annals</span> so long. He says, &ldquo;I am sorry to see that Dr. Johnson is in a state of languor. Why should a sober Christian, neither an enthusiast nor a fanatick, be very merry or very sad?&rdquo; I envy his Lordship&rsquo;s comfortable constitution: but well do I know that languor and dejection will afflict the best, however excellent their principles. I am in possession of Lord Hailes&rsquo;s opinion in his own hand-writing, and have had it for some time. My excuse then for procrastination must be, that I wanted to have it copied; and I have now put that off so long, that it will be better to bring it with me than send it, as I shall probably get you to look at it sooner, when I solicit you in person.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;My wife, who is, I thank GOD, a good deal better, is much obliged to you for your very polite and courteous offer of your apartment: but, if she goes to London, it will be best for her to have lodgings in the more airy vicinity of Hyde-Park. I, however, doubt much if I shall be able to prevail with her to accompany me to the metropolis; for she is so different from you and me, that she dislikes travelling; and she is so anxious about her children, that she thinks she should be unhappy if at a distance from them. She therefore wishes rather to go to some country place in Scotland, where she can have them with her.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I purpose being in London about the 20th of next month, as I think it creditable to appear in the House of Lords as one of Douglas&rsquo;s Counsel, in the great and last competition between Duke Hamilton and him.</p>
<p class="p10">* * * * *</p>
<p class="p21">&lsquo;I am sorry poor Mrs. Williams is so ill: though her temper is unpleasant, she has always been polite and obliging to me. I wish many happy years to good Mr. Levett, who I suppose holds his usual place at your breakfast table.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I ever am, my dear Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your affectionate humble servant,</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;JAMES BOSWELL.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">TO THE SAME.</span></p>
<p class="p21">&lsquo;Edinburgh, Feb. 28, 1778.</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">&lsquo;MY DEAR SIR,</span></p>
<p class="p21">&lsquo;You are at present busy amongst the English poets, preparing, for the publick instruction and entertainment, Prefaces, biographical and critical. It will not, therefore, be out of season to appeal to you for the decision of a controversy which has arisen between a lady and me concerning a passage in Parnell. That poet tells us, that his Hermit quitted his cell</p>
<p class="p26">&ldquo;… to know the world by sight,<br/>To find if <span class="t8">books</span> or <span class="t8">swains</span> report it right;<br/>(For yet by <span class="t8">swains alone</span> the world he knew,<br/>Whose feet came wand&rsquo;ring o&rsquo;er the nightly dew.)&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I maintain, that there is an inconsistency here; for as the Hermit&rsquo;s notions of the world were formed from the reports both of <span class="t8">books</span> and <span class="t8">swains</span>, he could not justly be said to know by <span class="t8">swains alone</span>. Be pleased to judge between us, and let us have your reasons.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;What do you say to <span class="t8">Taxation no Tyranny</span>, now, after Lord North&rsquo;s declaration, or confession, or whatever else his conciliatory speech should be called? I never differed from you in politicks but upon two points, &mdash; the Middlesex Election, and the Taxation of the Americans by the <span class="t8">British Houses of Representatives</span>. There is a <span class="t8">charm </span>in the word <span class="t8">Parliament</span>, so I avoid it. As I am a steady and a warm Tory, I regret that the King does not see it to be better for him to receive constitutional supplies from his American subjects by the voice of their own assemblies, where his Royal Person is represented, than through the medium of his British subjects. I am persuaded that the power of the Crown, which I wish to increase, would be greater when in contact with all its dominions, than if &ldquo;the rays of regal bounty&rdquo; were to &ldquo;shine&rdquo; upon America through that dense and troubled body, a modern British Parliament. But, enough of this subject; for your angry voice at Ashbourne upon it, still sounds aweful &ldquo;in my mind&rsquo;s <span class="t8">ears</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I ever am, my dear Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your most affectionate humble servant,</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;JAMES BOSWELL.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">TO THE SAME.</span></p>
<p class="p21">&lsquo;Edinburgh, March 12, 1778.</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">&lsquo;MY DEAR SIR,</span></p>
<p class="p21">&lsquo;The alarm of your late illness distressed me but a few hours; for on the evening of the day that it reached me, I found it contradicted in <span class="t8">The London Chronicle</span>, which I could depend upon as authentick concerning you, Mr. Strahan being the printer of it. I did not see the paper in which &ldquo;the approaching extinction of a bright luminary&rdquo; was announced. Sir William Forbes told me of it; and he says, he saw me so uneasy, that he did not give me the report in such strong terms as he read it. He afterwards sent me a letter from Mr. Langton to him, which relieved me much. I am, however, not quite easy, as I have not heard from you; and now I shall not have that comfort before I see you, for I set out for London to-morrow before the post comes in. I hope to be with you on Wednesday morning; and I ever am, with the highest veneration, my dear Sir, your much obliged, faithful, and affectionate,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Humble servant,</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;JAMES BOSWELL.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Wednesday, March 18, I arrived in London, and was informed by good Mr. Francis that his master was better, and was gone to Mr. Thrale&rsquo;s at Streatham, to which place I wrote to him, begging to know when he would be in town. He was not expected for some time; but next day having called on Dr. Taylor, in Dean&rsquo;s-yard, Westminster, I found him there, and was told he had come to town for a few hours. He met me with his usual kindness, but instantly returned to the writing of something on which he was employed when I came in, and on which he seemed much intent. Finding him thus engaged, I made my visit very short, and had no more of his conversation, except his expressing a serious regret that a friend of ours was living at too much expence, considering how poor an appearance he made: &lsquo;If (said he) a man has splendour from his expence, if he spends his money in pride or in pleasure, he has value: but if he lets others spend it for him, which is most commonly the case, he has no advantage from it.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Friday, March 20, I found him at his own house, sitting with Mrs. Williams, and was informed that the room formerly allotted to me was now appropriated to a charitable purpose; Mrs. Desmoulins, and I think her daughter, and a Miss Carmichael, being all lodged in it. Such was his humanity, and such his generosity, that Mrs. Desmoulins herself told me, he allowed her half-a-guinea a week. Let it be remembered, that this was above a twelfth part of his pension.</p>
<p class="p24">His liberality, indeed, was at all periods of his life very remarkable. Mr. Howard, of Lichfield, at whose father&rsquo;s house Johnson had in his early years been kindly received, told me, that when he was a boy at the Charter-House, his father wrote to him to go and pay a visit to Mr. Samuel Johnson, which he accordingly did, and found him in an upper room, of poor appearance. Johnson received him with much courteousness, and talked a great deal to him, as to a school-boy, of the course of his education, and other particulars. When he afterwards came to know and understand the high character of this great man, he recollected his condescension with wonder. He added, that when he was going away, Mr. Johnson presented him with half-a-guinea; and this, said Mr. Howard, was at a time when he probably had not another.</p>
<p class="p24">We retired from Mrs. Williams to another room. Tom Davies soon after joined us. He had now unfortunately failed in his circumstances, and was much indebted to Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s kindness for obtaining for him many alleviations of his distress. After he went away, Johnson blamed his folly in quitting the stage, by which he and his wife got five hundred pounds a year. I said, I believed it was owing to Churchill&rsquo;s attack upon him,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;He mouths a sentence, as curs mouth a bone.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">JOHNSON. &lsquo;I believe so too, Sir. But what a man is he, who is to be driven from the stage by a line? Another line would have driven him from his shop.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I told him, that I was engaged as Counsel at the bar of the House of Commons to oppose a road-bill in the county of Stirling, and asked him what mode he would advise me to follow in addressing such an audience. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, you must provide yourself with a good deal of extraneous matter, which you are to produce occasionally, so as to fill up the time; for you must consider, that they do not listen much. If you begin with the strength of your cause, it may be lost before they begin to listen. When you catch a moment of attention, press the merits of the question upon them.&rsquo; He said, as to one point of the merits, that he thought &lsquo;it would be a wrong thing to deprive the small landholders of the privilege of assessing themselves for making and repairing the high roads; <span class="t8">it was destroying a certain portion of liberty, without a good reason, which was always a bad thing</span>! When I mentioned this observation next day to Mr. Wilkes, he pleasantly said, &lsquo;What! does <span class="t8">he</span> talk of liberty? <span class="t8">Liberty</span> is as ridiculous in <span class="t8">his</span> mouth as <span class="t8">Religion</span> in <span class="t8">mine</span>!&rsquo; Mr. Wilkes&rsquo;s advice, as to the best mode of speaking at the bar of the House of Commons, was not more respectful towards the senate, than that of Dr. Johnson. &lsquo;Be as impudent as you can, as merry as you can, and say whatever comes uppermost. Jack Lee is the best heard there of any Counsel; and he is the most impudent dog, and always abusing us.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">In my interview with Dr. Johnson this evening, I was quite easy, quite as his companion; upon which I find in my Journal the following reflection: &lsquo;So ready is my mind to suggest matter for dissatisfaction, that I felt a sort of regret that I was so easy. I missed that aweful reverence with which I used to contemplate MR. SAMUEL JOHNSON, in the complex magnitude of his literary, moral, and religious character. I have a wonderful superstitious love of <span class="t8">mystery</span>; when, perhaps, the truth is, that it is owing to the cloudy darkness of my own mind. I should be glad that I am more advanced in my progress of being, so that I can view Dr. Johnson with a steadier and clearer eye. My dissatisfaction to-night was foolish. Would it not be foolish to regret that we shall have less mystery in a future state? That we &ldquo;now see in a glass darkly,&rdquo; but shall &ldquo;then see face to face?&rdquo;&rsquo; This reflection, which I thus freely communicate, will be valued by the thinking part of my readers, who may have themselves experienced a similar state of mind.</p>
<p class="p24">He returned next day to Streatham, to Mr. Thrale&rsquo;s; where, as Mr. Strahan once complained to me, &lsquo;he was in a great measure absorbed from the society of his old friends.&rsquo; I was kept in London by business, and wrote to him on the 27th, that a separation from him for a week, when we were so near, was equal to a separation for a year, when we were at four hundred miles distance. I went to Streatham on Monday, March 30. Before he appeared, Mrs. Thrale made a very characteristical remark:&mdash; &lsquo;I do not know for certain what will please Dr. Johnson: but I know for certain that it will displease him to praise any thing, even what he likes, extravagantly.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">At dinner he laughed at querulous declamations against the age, on account of luxury, &mdash; increase of London, &mdash; scarcity of provisions, &mdash; and other such topicks. &lsquo;Houses (said he) will be built till rents fall: and corn is more plentiful now than ever it was.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I had before dinner repeated a ridiculous story told me by an old man who had been a passenger with me in the stage-coach to-day. Mrs. Thrale, having taken occasion to allude to it in talking to me, called it &lsquo;The story told you by the old <span class="t8">woman</span>.&rsquo;&mdash; &lsquo;Now, Madam, (said I,) give me leave to catch you in the fact; it was not an old <span class="t8">woman</span>, but an old <span class="t8">man</span>, whom I mentioned as having told me this.&rsquo; I presumed to take an opportunity, in presence of Johnson, of shewing this lively lady how ready she was, unintentionally, to deviate from exact authenticity of narration.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">Thomas à Kempis</span> (he observed) must be a good book, as the world has opened its arms to receive it. It is said to have been printed, in one language or other, as many times as there have been months since it first came out. I always was struck with this sentence in it: &lsquo;Be not angry that you cannot make others as you wish them to be, since you cannot make yourself as you wish to be.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He said, &lsquo;I was angry with Hurd about Cowley, for having published a selection of his works: but, upon better consideration, I think there is no impropriety in a man&rsquo;s publishing as much as he chooses of any authour, if he does not put the rest out of the way. A man, for instance, may print the <span class="t8">Odes</span> of Horace alone.&rsquo; He seemed to be in a more indulgent humour, than when this subject was discussed between him and Mr. Murphy.</p>
<p class="p24">When we were at tea and coffee, there came in Lord Trimlestown, in whose family was an ancient Irish peerage, but it suffered by taking the generous side in the troubles of the last century. He was a man of pleasing conversation, and was accompanied by a young gentleman, his son.</p>
<p class="p24">I mentioned that I had in my possession the <span class="t8">Life of Sir Robert Sibbald</span>, the celebrated Scottish antiquary, and founder of the Royal College of Physicians at Edinburgh, in the original manuscript in his own handwriting; and that it was I believed the most natural and candid account of himself that ever was given by any man. As an instance, he tells that the Duke of Perth, then Chancellor of Scotland, pressed him very much to come over to the Roman Catholick faith: that he resisted all his Grace&rsquo;s arguments for a considerable time, till one day he felt himself, as it were, instantaneously convinced, and with tears in his eyes ran into the Duke&rsquo;s arms, and embraced the ancient religion; that he continued very steady in it for some time, and accompanied his Grace to London one winter, and lived in his household; that there he found the rigid fasting prescribed by the church very severe upon him; that this disposed him to reconsider the controversy, and having then seen that he was in the wrong, he returned to Protestantism. I talked of some time or other publishing this curious life. MRS. THRALE. &lsquo;I think you had as well let alone that publication. To discover such weakness, exposes a man when he is gone.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Nay, it is an honest picture of human nature. How often are the primary motives of our greatest actions as small as Sibbald&rsquo;s, for his re-conversion.&rsquo; MRS. THRALE. &lsquo;But may they not as well be forgotten?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;No, Madam, a man loves to review his own mind. That is the use of a diary, or journal.&rsquo; LORD TRIMLESTOWN. &lsquo;True, Sir. As the ladies love to see themselves in a glass; so a man likes to see himself in his journal.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;A very pretty allusion.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Yes, indeed.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;And as a lady adjusts her dress before a mirror, a man adjusts his character by looking at his journal.&rsquo; I next year found the very same thought in Atterbury&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Funeral Sermon on Lady Cutts</span>; where, having mentioned her <span class="t8">Diary</span>, he says, &lsquo;In this glass she every day dressed her mind.&rsquo; This is a proof of coincidence, and not of plagiarism; for I had never read that sermon before.</p>
<p class="p24">Next morning, while we were at breakfast, Johnson gave a very earnest recommendation of what he himself practised with the utmost conscientiousness: I mean a strict attention to truth, even in the most minute particulars. &lsquo;Accustom your children (said he) constantly to this; if a thing happened at one window, and they, when relating it, say that it happened at another, do not let it pass, but instantly check them; you do not know where deviation from truth will end.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;It may come to the door: and when once an account is at all varied in one circumstance, it may by degrees be varied so as to be totally different from what really happened.&rsquo; Our lively hostess, whose fancy was impatient of the rein, fidgeted at this, and ventured to say, &lsquo;Nay, this is too much. If Mr. Johnson should forbid me to drink tea, I would comply, as I should feel the restraint only twice a day; but little variations in narrative must happen a thousand times a day, if one is not perpetually watching.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Well, Madam, and you <span class="t8">ought</span> to be perpetually watching. It is more from carelessness about truth than from intentional lying, that there is so much falsehood in the world.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">In his review of Dr. Warton&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Essay on the Writings and Genius of Pope</span>, Johnson has given the following salutary caution upon this subject: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Nothing but experience could evince the frequency of false information, or enable any man to conceive that so many groundless reports should be propagated, as every man of eminence may hear of himself. Some men relate what they think, as what they know; some men of confused memories and habitual inaccuracy, ascribe to one man what belongs to another; and some talk on, without thought or care. A few men are sufficient to broach falsehoods, which are afterwards innocently diffused by successive relaters.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Had he lived to read what Sir John Hawkins and Mrs. Piozzi have related concerning himself, how much would he have found his observation illustrated. He was indeed so much impressed with the prevalence of falsehood, voluntary or unintentional, that I never knew any person who upon hearing an extraordinary circumstance told, discovered more of the <span class="t8">incredulus odi</span>. He would say, with a significant look and decisive tone, &lsquo;It is not so. Do not tell this again.&rsquo; He inculcated upon all his friends the importance of perpetual vigilance against the slightest degrees of falsehood; the effect of which, as Sir Joshua Reynolds observed to me, has been, that all who were of his <span class="t8">school</span> are distinguished for a love of truth and accuracy, which they would not have possessed in the same degree, if they had not been acquainted with Johnson.</p>
<p class="p24">Talking of ghosts, he said, &lsquo;It is wonderful that five thousand years have now elapsed since the creation of the world, and still it is undecided whether or not there has ever been an instance of the spirit of any person appearing after death. All argument is against it; but all belief is for it.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He said, &lsquo;John Wesley&rsquo;s conversation is good, but he is never at leisure. He is always obliged to go at a certain hour. This is very disagreeable to a man who loves to fold his legs and have out his talk, as I do.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Friday, April 3, I dined with him in London, in a company where were present several eminent men, whom I shall not name, but distinguish their parts in the conversation by different letters.</p>
<p class="p24">F. &lsquo;I have been looking at this famous antique marble dog of Mr. Jennings, valued at a thousand guineas, said to be Alcibiades&rsquo;s dog.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;His tail then must be docked. That was the mark of Alcibiades&rsquo;s dog.&rsquo; E. &lsquo;A thousand guineas! The representation of no animal whatever is worth so much, at this rate a dead dog would indeed be better than a living lion.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, it is not the worth of the thing, but of the skill in forming it which is so highly estimated. Every thing that enlarges the sphere of human powers, that shews man he can do what he thought he could not do, is valuable. The first man who balanced a straw upon his nose; Johnson, who rode upon three horses at a time; in short, all such men deserved the applause of mankind, not on account of the use of what they did, but of the dexterity which they exhibited.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Yet a misapplication of time and assiduity is not to be encouraged. Addison, in one of his <span class="t8">Spectators</span>, commends the judgement of a King, who, as a suitable reward to a man that by long perseverance had attained to the art of throwing a barleycorn through the eye of a needle, gave him a bushel of barley.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;He must have been a King of Scotland, where barley is scarce.&rsquo; F. &lsquo;One of the most remarkable antique figures of an animal is the boar at Florence.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;The first boar that is well made in marble, should be preserved as a wonder. When men arrive at a facility of making boars well, then the workmanship is not of such value, but they should however be preserved as examples, and as a greater security for the restoration of the art, should it be lost.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">E. &lsquo;We hear prodigious complaints at present of emigration. I am convinced that emigration makes a country more populous.&rsquo; J. &lsquo;That sounds very much like a paradox.&rsquo; E. &lsquo;Exportation of men, like exportation of all other commodities, makes more be produced.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;But there would be more people were there not emigration, provided there were food for more.&rsquo; E. &lsquo;No; leave a few breeders, and you&rsquo;ll have more people than if there were no emigration.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Nay, Sir, it is plain there will be more people, if there are more breeders. Thirty cows in good pasture will produce more calves than ten cows, provided they have good bulls.&rsquo; E. &lsquo;There are bulls enough in Ireland.&rsquo; JOHNSON. (smiling,) &lsquo;So, Sir, I should think from your argument.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;You said, exportation of men, like exportation of other commodities, makes more be produced. But a bounty is given to encourage the exportation of corn, and no bounty is given for the exportation of men; though, indeed, those who go, gain by it.&rsquo; R. &lsquo;But the bounty on the exportation of corn is paid at home.&rsquo; E. &lsquo;That&rsquo;s the same thing.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;No, Sir.&rsquo; R. &lsquo;A man who stays at home, gains nothing by his neighbours emigrating.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;I can understand that emigration may be the cause that more people may be produced in a country; but the country will not therefore be the more populous; for the people issue from it. It can only be said that there is a flow of people. It is an encouragement to have children, to know that they can get a living by emigration.&rsquo; R. &lsquo;Yes, if there were an emigration of children under six years of age. But they don&rsquo;t emigrate till they could earn their livelihood in some way at home.&rsquo; C. &lsquo;It is remarkable that the most unhealthy countries, where there are the most destructive diseases, such as Egypt and Bengal, are the most populous.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Countries which are the most populous have the most destructive diseases. <span class="t8">That</span> is the true state of the proposition.&rsquo; C. &lsquo;Holland is very unhealthy, yet it is exceedingly populous.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;I know not that Holland is unhealthy. But its populousness is owing to an influx of people from all other countries. Disease cannot be the cause of populousness, for it not only carries off a great proportion of the people, but those who are left are weakened and unfit for the purposes of increase.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">R. &lsquo;Mr. E., I don&rsquo;t mean to flatter, but when posterity reads one of your speeches in Parliament, it will be difficult to believe that you took so much pains, knowing with certainty that it could produce no effect, that not one vote would be gained by it.&rsquo; E. &lsquo;Waiving your compliment to me, I shall say in general, that it is very well worth while for a man to take pains to speak well in Parliament. A man, who has vanity, speaks to display his talents; and if a man speaks well, he gradually establishes a certain reputation and consequence in the general opinion, which sooner or later will have its political reward. Besides, though not one vote is gained, a good speech has its effect. Though an act which has been ably opposed passes into a law, yet in its progress it is modelled, it is softened in such a manner, that we see plainly the Minister has been told, that the Members attached to him are so sensible of its injustice or absurdity from what they have heard, that it must be altered.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;And, Sir, there is a gratification of pride. Though we cannot out-vote them we will out-argue them. They shall not do wrong without its being shown both to themselves and to the world.&rsquo; E. &lsquo;The House of Commons is a mixed body. (I except the Minority, which I hold to be pure, [smiling] but I take the whole House.) It is a mass by no means pure; but neither is it wholly corrupt, though there is a large proportion of corruption in it. There are many members who generally go with the Minister, who will not go all lengths. There are many honest well-meaning country gentleman who are in parliament only to keep up the consequence of their families. Upon most of these a good speech will have influence.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;We are all more or less governed by interest. But interest will not make us do every thing. In a case which admits of doubt, we try to think on the side which is for our interest, and generally bring ourselves to act accordingly. But the subject must admit of diversity of colouring; it must receive a colour on that side. In the House of Commons there are members enough who will not vote what is grossly unjust or absurd. No, Sir, there must always be right enough, or appearance of right, to keep wrong in countenance.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;There is surely always a majority in parliament who have places, or who want to have them, and who therefore will be generally ready to support government without requiring any pretext.&rsquo; E. &lsquo;True, Sir; that majority will always follow</p>
<p class="p24">&ldquo;<span class="t8">Quo clamor vocat et turba, faventium</span>.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">BOSWELL. &lsquo;Well now, let us take the common phrase, Place-hunters. I thought they had hunted without regard to any thing, just as their huntsmen, the Minister, leads, looking only to the prey.&rsquo; J. &lsquo;But taking your metaphor, you know that in hunting there are few so desperately keen as to follow without reserve. Some do not choose to leap ditches and hedges and risk their necks, or gallop over steeps, or even to dirty themselves in bogs and mire.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;I am glad there are some good, quiet, moderate political hunters.&rsquo; E. &lsquo;I believe, in any body of men in England, I should have been in the Minority; I have always been in the Minority.&rsquo; P. &lsquo;The House of Commons resembles a private company. How seldom is any man convinced by another&rsquo;s argument; passion and pride rise against it.&rsquo; R. &lsquo;What would be the consequence, if a Minister, sure of a majority in the House of Commons, should resolve that there should be no speaking at all upon his side.&rsquo; E. &lsquo;He must soon go out. That has been tried; but it was found it would not do.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">E. &lsquo;The Irish language is not primitive; it is Teutonick, a mixture of the northern tongues: it has much English in it.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;It may have been radically Teutonick; but English and High Dutch have no similarity to the eye, though radically the same. Once, when looking into Low Dutch, I found, in a whole page, only one word similar to English; <span class="t8">stroem</span>, like <span class="t8">stream</span>, and it signified <span class="t8">tide</span>&rsquo;. E. &lsquo;I remember having seen a Dutch Sonnet, in which I found this word, <span class="t8">roesnopies</span>. Nobody would at first think that this could be English; but, when we enquire, we find <span class="t8">roes</span>, rose, and <span class="t8">nopie</span>, knob; so we have <span class="t8">rosebuds</span>&rsquo;.</p>
<p class="p24">JOHNSON. &lsquo;I have been reading Thicknesse&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Travels</span>, which I think are entertaining.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;What, Sir, a good book?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Yes, Sir, to read once; I do not say you are to make a study of it, and digest it; and I believe it to be a true book in his intention. All travellers generally mean to tell truth; though Thicknesse observes, upon Smollet&rsquo;s account of his alarming a whole town in France by firing a blunderbuss, and frightening a French nobleman till he made him tie on his portmanteau, that he would be loth to say Smollet had told two lies in one page; but he had found the only town in France where these things could have happened. Travellers must often be mistaken. In every thing, except where mensuration can be applied, they may honestly differ. There has been, of late, a strange turn in travellers to be displeased.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">E. &lsquo;From the experience which I have had, &mdash; and I have had a great deal, &mdash; I have learnt to think <span class="t8">better</span> of mankind.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;From my experience I have found them worse in commercial dealings, more disposed to cheat, than I had any notion of; but more disposed to do one another good than I had conceived.&rsquo; J. &lsquo;Less just and more beneficent.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;And really it is wonderful, considering how much attention is necessary for men to take care of themselves, and ward off immediate evils which press upon them, it is wonderful how much they do for others. As it is said of the greatest liar, that he tells more truth than falsehood; so it may be said of the worst man, that he does more good than evil.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Perhaps from experience men may be found happier than we suppose.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;No, Sir; the more we enquire, we shall find men the less happy.&rsquo; P. &lsquo;As to thinking better or worse of mankind from experience, some cunning people will not be satisfied unless they have put men to the test, as they think. There is a very good story told of Sir Godfrey Kneller, in his character of a Justice of the peace. A gentleman brought his servant before him, upon an accusation of having stolen some money from him; but it having come out that he had laid it purposely in the servant&rsquo;s way, in order to try his honesty, Sir Godfrey sent the master to prison.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;To resist temptation once, is not a sufficient proof of honesty. If a servant, indeed, were to resist the continued temptation of silver lying in a window, as some people let it lye, when he is sure his master does not know how much there is of it, he would give a strong proof of honesty. But this is a proof to which you have no right to put a man. You know, humanly speaking, there is a certain degree of temptation, which will overcome any virtue. Now, in so far as you approach temptation to a man, you do him an injury; and, if he is overcome, you share his guilt.&rsquo; P. &lsquo;And, when once overcome, it is easier for him to be got the better of again.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Yes, you are his seducer; you have debauched him. I have known a man resolved to put friendship to the test, by asking a friend to lend him money merely with that view, when he did not want it.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;That is very wrong, Sir. Your friend may be a narrow man, and yet have many good qualities: narrowness may be his only fault. Now you are trying his general character as a friend, by one particular singly, in which he happens to be defective, when, in truth, his character is composed of many particulars.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">E. &lsquo;I understand the hogshead of claret, which this society was favoured with by our friend the Dean, is nearly out; I think he should be written to, to send another of the same kind. Let the request be made with a happy ambiguity of expression, so that we may have the chance of his sending <span class="t8">it</span> also as a present.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;I am willing to offer my services as secretary on this occasion.&rsquo; P. &lsquo;As many as are for Dr. Johnson being secretary hold up your hands. &mdash; Carried unanimously.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;He will be our Dictator.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;No, the company is to dictate to me. I am only to write for wine; and I am quite disinterested, as I drink none; I shall not be suspected of having forged the application. I am no more than humble <span class="t8">scribe</span>.&rsquo; E. &lsquo;Then you shall <span class="t8">pre</span>scribe.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Very well. The first play of words to-day.&rsquo; J. &lsquo;No, no; the <span class="t8">bulls</span> in Ireland.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Were I your Dictator you should have no wine. It would be my business <span class="t8">cavere ne quid detrimenti Respublica caperet</span>, and wine is dangerous. Rome was ruined by luxury,&rsquo; (smiling.) E. &lsquo;If you allow no wine as Dictator, you shall not have me for your master of horse.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Saturday, April 4, I drank tea with Johnson at Dr. Taylor&rsquo;s, where he had dined. He entertained us with an account of a tragedy written by a Dr. Kennedy, (not the Lisbon physician.) &lsquo;The catastrophe of it (said he) was, that a King, who was jealous of his Queen with his prime-minister, castrated himself. This tragedy was actually shewn about in manuscript to several people, and, amongst others, to Mr. Fitzherbert, who repeated to me two lines of the Prologue:</p>
<p class="p26">&ldquo;Our hero&rsquo;s fate we have but gently touch&rsquo;d;<br/>The fair might blame us, if it were less couch&rsquo;d.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">It is hardly to be believed what absurd and indecent images men will introduce into their writings, without being sensible of the absurdity and indecency. I remember Lord Orrery told me, that there was a pamphlet written against Sir Robert Walpole, the whole of which was an allegory on the PHALLICK OBSCENITY. The Duchess of Buckingham asked Lord Orrery <span class="t8">who</span> this person was? He answered he did not know. She said, she would send to Mr. Pulteney, who, she supposed, could inform her. So then, to prevent her from making herself ridiculous, Lord Orrery sent her Grace a note, in which he gave her to understand what was meant.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He was very silent this evening; and read in a variety of books: suddenly throwing down one, and taking up another.</p>
<p class="p24">He talked of going to Streatham that night. TAYLOR. &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll be robbed if you do: or you must shoot a highwayman. Now I would rather be robbed than do that; I would not shoot a highwayman.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;But I would rather shoot him in the instant when he is attempting to rob me, than afterwards swear against him at the Old-Bailey, to take away his life, after he has robbed me. I am surer I am right in the one case than in the other. I may be mistaken as to the man, when I swear: I cannot be mistaken, if I shoot him in the act. Besides, we feel less reluctance reluctance to take away a man&rsquo;s life, when we are heated by the injury, than to do it at a distance of time by an oath, after we have cooled.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;So, Sir, you would rather act from the motive of private passion, than that of publick advantage.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Nay, Sir, when I shoot the highwayman I act from both.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Very well, very well. &mdash; There is no catching him.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;At the same time one does not know what to say. For perhaps one may, a year after, hang himself from uneasiness for having shot a man. Few minds are fit to be trusted with so great a thing.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Then, Sir, you would not shoot him?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;But I might be vexed afterwards for that too.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Thrale&rsquo;s carriage not having come for him, as he expected, I accompanied him some part of the way home to his own house. I told him, that I had talked of him to Mr. Dunning a few days before, and had said, that in his company we did not so much interchange conversation, as listen to him; and that Dunning observed, upon this, &lsquo;One is always willing to listen to Dr. Johnson:&rsquo; to which I answered, &lsquo;That is a great deal from you, Sir.&rsquo;&mdash; &lsquo;Yes, Sir, (said Johnson,) a great deal indeed. Here is a man willing to listen, to whom the world is listening all the rest of the year.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;I think, Sir, it is right to tell one man of such a handsome thing, which has been said of him by another. It tends to increase benevolence.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Undoubtedly it is right, Sir.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Tuesday, April 7, I breakfasted with him at his house. He said, &lsquo;nobody was content.&rsquo; I mentioned to him a respectable person in Scotland whom he knew; and I asserted, that I really believed he was always content. JOHNSON. &lsquo;No, Sir, he is not content with the present; he has always some new scheme, some new plantation, something which is future. You know he was not content as a widower; for he married again.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;But he is not restless.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, he is only locally at rest. A chymist is locally at rest; but his mind is hard at work. This gentleman has done with external exertions. It is too late for him to engage in distant projects.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;He seems to amuse himself quite well; to have his attention fixed, and his tranquillity preserved by very small matters. I have tried this; but it would not do with me.&rsquo; JOHNSON, (laughing) &lsquo;No, Sir; it must be born with a man to be contented to take up with little things. Women have a great advantage that they may take up with little things, without disgracing themselves: a man cannot, except with fiddling. Had I learnt to fiddle, I should have done nothing else.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Pray, Sir, did you ever play on any musical instrument?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;No, Sir. I once bought me a flagelet; but I never made out a tune.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;A flagelet, Sir! &mdash; so small an instrument? I should have liked to hear you play on the violoncello. <span class="t8">That</span> should have been <span class="t8">your</span> instrument.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, I might as well have played on the violoncello as another; but I should have done nothing else. No, Sir; a man would never undertake great things, could he be amused with small. I once tried knotting. Dempster&rsquo;s sister undertook to teach me; but I could not learn it.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;So, Sir; it will be related in pompous narrative, &ldquo;Once for his amusement he tried knotting; nor did this Hercules disdain the distaff.&rdquo;&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Knitting of stockings is a good amusement. As a freeman of Aberdeen I should be a knitter of stockings.&rsquo; He asked me to go down with him and dine at Mr. Thrale&rsquo;s at Streatham, to which I agreed. I had lent him <span class="t8">An Account of Scotland, in 1702</span>, written by a man of various enquiry, an English chaplain to a regiment stationed there. JOHNSON. &lsquo;It is sad stuff, Sir, miserably written, as books in general then were. There is now an elegance of style universally diffused. No man now writes so ill as Martin&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Account of the Hebrides</span> is written. A man could not write so ill, if he should try. Set a merchant&rsquo;s clerk now to write, and he&rsquo;ll do better.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He talked to me with serious concern of a certain female friend&rsquo;s &lsquo;laxity of narration, and inattention to truth.&rsquo;&mdash; &lsquo;I am as much vexed (said he) at the ease with which she hears it mentioned to her, as at the thing itself. I told her, &ldquo;Madam, you are contented to hear every day said to you, what the highest of mankind have died for, rather than bear.&rdquo; &mdash; You know, Sir, the highest of mankind have died rather than bear to be told they had uttered a falsehood. Do talk to her of it: I am weary.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">BOSWELL. &lsquo;Was not Dr. John Campbell a very inaccurate man in his narrative, Sir? He once told me, that he drank thirteen bottles of port at a sitting.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, I do not know that Campbell ever lied with pen and ink; but you could not entirely depend on any thing he told you in conversation: if there was fact mixed with it. However, I loved Campbell: he was a solid orthodox man: he had a reverence for religion. Though defective in practice, he was religious in principle; and he did nothing grossly wrong that I have heard.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I told him, that I had been present the day before, when Mrs. Montagu, the literary lady, sat to Miss Reynolds for her picture; and that she said, &lsquo;she had bound up Mr. Gibbon&rsquo;s <span class="t8">History</span> without the last two offensive chapters; for that she thought the book so far good, as it gave, in an elegant manner, the substance of the bad writers <span class="t8">medii aevi</span>, which the late Lord Lyttelton advised her to read.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, she has not read them: she shews none of this impetuosity to me: she does not know Greek, and, I fancy, knows little Latin. She is willing you should think she knows them; but she does not say she does.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Mr. Harris, who was present, agreed with her.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Harris was laughing at her, Sir. Harris is a sound sullen scholar; he does not like interlopers. Harris, however, is a prig, and a bad prig. I looked into his book, and thought he did not understand his own system.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;He says plain things in a formal and abstract way, to be sure: but his method is good: for to have clear notions upon any subject, we must have recourse to analytick arrangement.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, it is what every body does, whether they will or no. But sometimes things may be made darker by definition. I see a <span class="t8">cow</span>, I define her, <span class="t8">Animal quadrupes ruminans cornutum</span>. But a goat ruminates, and a cow may have no horns. <span class="t8">Cow</span> is plainer.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;I think Dr. Franklin&rsquo;s definition of <span class="t8">Man</span> a good one&mdash; &ldquo;A tool-making animal.&rdquo;&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;But many a man never made a tool; and suppose a man without arms, he could not make a tool.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Talking of drinking wine, he said, &lsquo;I did not leave off wine, because I could not bear it; I have drunk three bottles of port without being the worse for it. University College has witnessed this.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Why then, Sir, did you leave it off?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, because it is so much better for a man to be sure that he is never to be intoxicated, never to lose the power over himself. I shall not begin to drink wine again, till I grow old, and want it.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;I think, Sir, you once said to me, that not to drink wine was a great deduction from life.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;It is a diminution of pleasure, to be sure; but I do not say a diminution of happiness. There is more happiness in being rational.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;But if we could have pleasure always, should not we be happy? The greatest part of men would compound for pleasure.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Supposing we could have pleasure always, an intellectual man would not compound for it. The greatest part of men would compound, because the greatest part of men are gross.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;I allow there may be greater pleasure than from wine. I have had more pleasure from your conversation, I have indeed; I assure you I have.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;When we talk of pleasure, we mean sensual pleasure. When a man says, he had pleasure with a woman, he does not mean conversation, but something of a very different nature. Philosophers tell you, that pleasure is <span class="t8">contrary</span> to happiness. Gross men prefer animal pleasure. So there are men who have preferred living among savages. Now what a wretch must he be, who is content with such conversation as can be had among savages! You may remember an officer at Fort Augustus, who had served in America, told us of a woman whom they were obliged to <span class="t8">bind</span>, in order to get her back from savage life.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;She must have been an animal, a beast.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, she was a speaking cat.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I mentioned to him that I had become very weary in a company where I heard not a single intellectual sentence, except that &lsquo;a man who had been settled ten years in Minorca was become a much inferiour man to what he was in London, because a man&rsquo;s mind grows narrow in a narrow place.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;A man&rsquo;s mind grows narrow in a narrow place, whose mind is enlarged only because he has lived in a large place: but what is got by books and thinking is preserved in a narrow place as well as in a large place. A man cannot know modes of life as well in Minorca as in London; but he may study mathematicks as well in Minorca.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know, Sir: if you had remained ten years in the Isle of Col, you would not have been the man that you now are.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Yes, Sir, if I had been there from fifteen to twenty-five; but not if from twenty-five to thirty-five.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;I own, Sir, the spirits which I have in London make me do every thing with more readiness and vigour. I can talk twice as much in London as any where else.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Of Goldsmith he said, &lsquo;He was not an agreeable companion, for he talked always for fame. A man who does so never can be pleasing. The man who talks to unburthen his mind is the man to delight you. An eminent friend of ours is not so agreeable as the variety of his knowledge would otherwise make him, because he talks partly from ostentation.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Soon after our arrival at Thrale&rsquo;s, I heard one of the maids calling eagerly on another, to go to Dr. Johnson. I wondered what this could mean. I afterwards learnt, that it was to give her a Bible, which he had brought from London as a present to her.</p>
<p class="p24">He was for a considerable time occupied in reading <span class="t8">Mémoires de Fontenelle</span>, leaning and swinging upon the low gate into the court, without his hat.</p>
<p class="p24">I looked into Lord Kames&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Sketches of the History of Man</span>; and mentioned to Dr. Johnson his censure of Charles the Fifth, for celebrating his funeral obsequies in his life-time, which, I told him, I had been used to think a solemn and affecting act. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, a man may dispose his mind to think so of that act of Charles; but it is so liable to ridicule, that if one man out of ten thousand laughs at it, he&rsquo;ll make the other nine thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine laugh too.&rsquo; I could not agree with him in this.</p>
<p class="p24">Sir John Pringle had expressed a wish that I would ask Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s opinion what were the best English sermons for style. I took an opportunity to-day of mentioning several to him. &mdash; <span class="t8">Atterbury</span>? JOHNSON. &lsquo;Yes, Sir, one of the best.&rsquo; BOSWELL. <span class="t8">Tillotson</span>? JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, not now. I should not advise a preacher at this day to imitate Tillotson&rsquo;s style: though I don&rsquo;t know; I should be cautious of objecting to what has been applauded by so many suffrages. &mdash; <span class="t8">South</span> is one of the best, if you except his peculiarities, and his violence, and sometimes coarseness of language. &mdash; <span class="t8">Seed</span> has a very fine style; but he is not very theological. &mdash; <span class="t8">Jortin&rsquo;s</span> sermons are very elegant. &mdash; <span class="t8">Sherlock&rsquo;s</span> style too is very elegant, though he has not made it his principal study. &mdash; And you may add <span class="t8">Smallridge</span>. All the latter preachers have a good style. Indeed, nobody now talks much of style: every body composes pretty well. There are no such unharmonious periods as there were a hundred years ago. I should recommend Dr. <span class="t8">Clarke&rsquo;s</span> sermons, were he orthodox. However, it is very well known <span class="t8">where</span> he was not orthodox, which was upon the doctrine of the Trinity, as to which he is a condemned heretick; so one is aware of it.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;I like Ogden&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Sermons on Prayer</span> very much, both for neatness of style and subtilty of reasoning.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;I should like to read all that Ogden has written.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;What I wish to know is, what sermons afford the best specimen of English pulpit eloquence.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;We have no sermons addressed to the passions that are good for any thing; if you mean that kind of eloquence.&rsquo; A CLERGYMAN: (whose name I do not recollect.) &lsquo;Were not Dodd&rsquo;s sermons addressed to the passions?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;They were nothing, Sir, be they addressed to what they may.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">At dinner, Mrs. Thrale expressed a wish to go and see Scotland. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Seeing Scotland, Madam, is only seeing a worse England. It is seeing the flower gradually fade away to the naked stalk. Seeing the Hebrides, indeed, is seeing quite a different scene.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Our poor friend, Mr. Thomas Davies, was soon to have a benefit at Drury-lane theatre, as some relief to his unfortunate circumstances. We were all warmly interested for his success, and had contributed to it. However, we thought there was no harm in having our joke, when he could not be hurt by it. I proposed that he should be brought on to speak a Prologue upon the occasion; and I began to mutter fragments of what it might be: as, that when now grown <span class="t8">old</span>, he was obliged to cry, &lsquo;Poor Tom&rsquo;s <span class="t8">a-cold</span>;&rsquo; &mdash; that he owned he had been driven from the stage by a Churchill, but that this was no disgrace, for a Churchill had beat the French; &mdash; that he had been satyrised as &lsquo;mouthing a sentence as curs mouth a bone,&rsquo; but he was now glad of a bone to pick.&mdash; &lsquo;Nay, (said Johnson,) I would have him to say,</p>
<p class="p24">&ldquo;Mad Tom is come to see the world again.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He and I returned to town in the evening. Upon the road, I endeavoured to maintain, in argument, that a landed gentleman is not under any obligation to reside upon his estate; and that by living in London he does no injury to his country. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, he does no injury to his country in general, because the money which he draws from it gets back again in circulation; but to his particular district, his particular parish, he does an injury. All that he has to give away is not given to those who have the first claim to it. And though I have said that the money circulates back, it is a long time before that happens. Then, Sir, a man of family and estate ought to consider himself as having the charge of a district, over which he is to diffuse civility and happiness.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Next day I found him at home in the morning. He praised Delany&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Observations on Swift</span>; said that his book and Lord Orrery&rsquo;s might both be true, though one viewed Swift more, and the other less favourably; and that, between both, we might have a complete notion of Swift.</p>
<p class="p24">Talking of a man&rsquo;s resolving to deny himself the use of wine, from moral and religious considerations, he said, &lsquo;He must not doubt about it. When one doubts as to pleasure, we know what will be the conclusion. I now no more think of drinking wine, than a horse does. The wine upon the table is no more for me, than for the dog that is under the table.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Thursday, April 9, I dined with him at Sir Joshua Reynolds&rsquo;s, with the Bishop of St. Asaph, (Dr. Shipley,) Mr. Allan Ramsay, Mr. Gibbon, Mr. Cambridge, and Mr. Langton. Mr. Ramsay had lately returned from Italy, and entertained us with his observations upon Horace&rsquo;s villa, which he had examined with great care. I relished this much, as it brought fresh into my mind what I had viewed with great pleasure thirteen years before. The Bishop, Dr. Johnson, and Mr. Cambridge, joined with Mr. Ramsay, in recollecting the various lines in Horace relating to the subject.</p>
<p class="p24">Horace&rsquo;s journey to Brundusium being mentioned, Johnson observed, that the brook which he describes is to be seen now, exactly as at that time, and that he had often wondered how it happened, that small brooks, such as this, kept the same situation for ages, notwithstanding earthquakes, by which even mountains have been changed, and agriculture, which produces such a variation upon the surface of the earth. CAMBRIDGE. &lsquo;A Spanish writer has this thought in a poetical conceit. After observing that most of the solid structures of Rome are totally perished, while the Tiber remains the same, he adds,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;<span class="t8">Lo que èra Firme huió solamente, Lo Fugitivo permanece y dura</span>.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, that is taken from Janus Vitalis:</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;… <span class="t8">immota labescunt; Et quae perpetuò sunt agitata manent</span>.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">The Bishop said, it appeared from Horace&rsquo;s writings that he was a cheerful contented man. JOHNSON. &lsquo;We have no reason to believe that, my Lord. Are we to think Pope was happy, because he says so in his writings? We see in his writings what he wished the state of his mind to appear. Dr. Young, who pined for preferment, talks with contempt of it in his writings, and affects to despise every thing that he did not despise.&rsquo; BISHOP OF ST. ASAPH. &lsquo;He was like other chaplains, looking for vacancies: but that is not peculiar to the clergy. I remember when I was with the army, after the battle of Lafeldt, the officers seriously grumbled that no general was killed.&rsquo; CAMBRIDGE. &lsquo;We may believe Horace more when he says,</p>
<p class="p24">&ldquo;<span class="t8">Romae Tibur amem, ventosus Tibure Romam</span>;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">than when he boasts of his consistency:</p>
<p class="p24">&ldquo;<span class="t8">Me constare mihi scis, et decedere tristem, Quandocunque trahunt invisa negotia Romam</span>.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">BOSWELL. &lsquo;How hard is it that man can never be at rest.&rsquo; RAMSAY. &lsquo;It is not in his nature to be at rest. When he is at rest, he is in the worst state that he can be in; for he has nothing to agitate him. He is then like the man in the Irish song,</p>
<p class="p26">&ldquo;There liv&rsquo;d a young man in Ballinacrazy.<br/>Who wanted a wife for to make him un<span class="t8">ai</span>sy.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Goldsmith being mentioned, Johnson observed, that it was long before his merit came to be acknowledged. That he once complained to him, in ludicrous terms of distress, &lsquo;Whenever I write any thing, the publick <span class="t8">make a point</span> to know nothing about it:&rsquo; but that his <span class="t8">Traveller</span> brought him into high reputation. LANGTON. &lsquo;There is not one bad line in that poem; not one of Dryden&rsquo;s careless verses.&rsquo; SIR JOSHUA. &lsquo;I was glad to hear Charles Fox say, it was one of the finest poems in the English language.&rsquo; LANGTON. &lsquo;Why was you glad? You surely had no doubt of this before.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;No; the merit of <span class="t8">The Traveller</span> is so well established, that Mr. Fox&rsquo;s praise cannot augment it, nor his censure diminish it.&rsquo; SIR JOSHUA. &lsquo;But his friends may suspect they had too great a partiality for him.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Nay, Sir, the partiality of his friends was always against him. It was with difficulty we could give him a hearing. Goldsmith had no settled notions upon any subject; so he talked always at random. It seemed to be his intention to blurt out whatever was in his mind, and see what would become of it. He was angry too, when catched in an absurdity; but it did not prevent him from falling into another the next minute. I remember Chamier, after talking with him for some time, said, &ldquo;Well, I do believe he wrote this poem himself: and, let me tell you, that is believing a great deal.&rdquo; Chamier once asked him, what he meant by <span class="t8">slow</span>, the last word in the first line of <span class="t8">The Traveller</span>,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;&ldquo;Remote, unfriended, melancholy, slow.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Did he mean tardiness of locomotion? Goldsmith, who would say something without consideration, answered, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; I was sitting by, and said, &ldquo;No, Sir; you do not mean tardiness of locomotion; you mean, that sluggishness of mind which comes upon a man in solitude.&rdquo; Chamier believed then that I had written the line as much as if he had seen me write it. Goldsmith, however, was a man, who, whatever he wrote, did it better than any other man could do. He deserved a place in Westminster-Abbey, and every year he lived, would have deserved it better. He had, indeed, been at no pains to fill his mind with knowledge. He transplanted it from one place to another; and it did not settle in his mind; so he could not tell what was in his own books.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">We talked of living in the country. JOHNSON. &lsquo;No wise man will go to live in the country, unless he has something to do which can be better done in the country. For instance: if he is to shut himself up for a year to study a science, it is better to look out to the fields, than to an opposite wall. Then, if a man walks out in the country, there is nobody to keep him from walking in again: but if a man walks out in London, he is not sure when he shall walk in again. A great city is, to be sure, the school for studying life; and &ldquo;The proper study of mankind is man,&rdquo; as Pope observes.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;I fancy London is the best place for society; though I have heard that the very first society of Paris is still beyond any thing that we have here.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, I question if in Paris such a company as is sitting round this table could be got together in less than half a year. They talk in France of the felicity of men and women living together: the truth is, that there the men are not higher than the women, they know no more than the women do, and they are not held down in their conversation by the presence of women.&rsquo; RAMSAY. &lsquo;Literature is upon the growth, it is in its spring in France. Here it is rather <span class="t8">passée</span>.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Literature was in France long before we had it. Paris was the second city for the revival of letters: Italy had it first, to be sure. What have we done for literature, equal to what was done by the Stephani and others in France? Our literature came to us through France. Caxton printed only two books, Chaucer and Gower, that were not translations from the French; and Chaucer, we know, took much from the Italians. No, Sir, if literature be in its spring in France, it is a second spring; it is after a winter. We are now before the French in literature; but we had it long after them. In England, any man who wears a sword and a powdered wig is ashamed to be illiterate. I believe it is not so in France. Yet there is, probably, a great deal of learning in France, because they have such a number of religious establishments; so many men who have nothing else to do but to study. I do not know this; but I take it upon the common principles of chance. Where there are many shooters, some will hit.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">We talked of old age. Johnson (now in his seventieth year,) said, &lsquo;It is a man&rsquo;s own fault, it is from want of use, if his mind grows torpid in old age.&rsquo; The Bishop asked, if an old man does not lose faster than he gets. JOHNSON. &lsquo;I think not, my Lord, if he exerts himself.&rsquo; One of the company rashly observed, that he thought it was happy for an old man that insensibility comes upon him. JOHNSON: (with a noble elevation and disdain,) &lsquo;No, Sir, I should never be happy by being less rational.&rsquo; BISHOP OF ST. ASAPH. &lsquo;Your wish then, Sir, is [Greek: gaeraskein didaskomenos].&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Yes, my Lord.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">His Lordship mentioned a charitable establishment in Wales, where people were maintained, and supplied with every thing, upon the condition of their contributing the weekly produce of their labour; and he said, they grew quite torpid for want of property. JOHNSON. &lsquo;They have no object for hope. Their condition cannot be better. It is rowing without a port.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">One of the company asked him the meaning of the expression in Juvenal, <span class="t8">unius lacertæ</span>. JOHNSON. &lsquo;I think it clear enough; as much ground as one may have a chance to find a lizard upon.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Commentators have differed as to the exact meaning of the expression by which the Poet intended to enforce the sentiment contained in the passage where these words occur. It is enough that they mean to denote even a very small possession, provided it be a man&rsquo;s own:</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;<span class="t8">Est aliquid quocunque loco quocunque recessu, Unius sese dominum fecisse lacertæ</span>.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">This season there was a whimsical fashion in the newspapers of applying Shakspeare&rsquo;s words to describe living persons well known in the world; which was done under the title of <span class="t8">Modern Characters from Shakspeare</span>; many of which were admirably adapted. The fancy took so much, that they were afterwards collected into a pamphlet. Somebody said to Johnson, across the table, that he had not been in those characters. &lsquo;Yes (said he) I have. I should have been sorry to be left out.&rsquo; He then repeated what had been applied to him,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I must borrow GARAGANTUA&rsquo;S mouth.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Miss Reynolds not perceiving at once the meaning of this, he was obliged to explain it to her, which had something of an aukward and ludicrous effect. &lsquo;Why, Madam, it has a reference to me, as using big words, which require the mouth of a giant to pronounce them. Garagantua is the name of a giant in <span class="t8">Rabelais</span>.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;But, Sir, there is another amongst them for you:</p>
<p class="p26">&ldquo;He would not flatter Neptune for his trident,<br/>Or Jove for his power to thunder.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">JOHNSON. &lsquo;There is nothing marked in that. No, Sir, Garagantua is the best.&rsquo; Notwithstanding this ease and good humour, when I, a little while afterwards, repeated his sarcasm on Kenrick, which was received with applause, he asked, &lsquo;<span class="t8">Who</span> said that?&rsquo; and on my suddenly answering, <span class="t8">Garagantua</span>, he looked serious, which was a sufficient indication that he did not wish it to be kept up.</p>
<p class="p24">When we went to the drawing-room there was a rich assemblage. Besides the company who had been at dinner, there were Mr. Garrick, Mr. Harris of Salisbury, Dr. Percy, Dr. Burney, Honourable Mrs. Cholmondeley, Miss Hannah More, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
<p class="p24">After wandering about in a kind of pleasing distraction for some time, I got into a corner, with Johnson, Garrick, and Harris. GARRICK: (to Harris.) &lsquo;Pray, Sir, have you read Potter&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Aeschylus</span>?&rsquo; HARRIS. &lsquo;Yes; and think it pretty.&rsquo; GARRICK. (to Johnson.) &lsquo;And what think you, Sir, of it?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;I thought what I read of it <span class="t8">verbiage</span>: but upon Mr. Harris&rsquo;s recommendation, I will read a play. (To Mr. Harris.) Don&rsquo;t prescribe two.&rsquo; Mr. Harris suggested one, I do not remember which. JOHNSON. &lsquo;We must try its effect as an English poem; that is the way to judge of the merit of a translation. Translations are, in general, for people who cannot read the original.&rsquo; I mentioned the vulgar saying, that Pope&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Homer</span> was not a good representation of the original. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, it is the greatest work of the kind that has ever been produced.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;The truth is, it is impossible perfectly to translate poetry. In a different language it may be the same tune, but it has not the same tone. Homer plays it on a bassoon; Pope on a flagelet.&rsquo; HARRIS. &lsquo;I think Heroick poetry is best in blank verse; yet it appears that rhyme is essential to English poetry, from our deficiency in metrical quantities. In my opinion, the chief excellence of our language is numerous prose.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir William Temple was the first writer who gave cadence to English prose. Before his time they were careless of arrangement, and did not mind whether a sentence ended with an important word or an insignificant word, or with what part of speech it was concluded.&rsquo; Mr. Langton, who now had joined us, commended Clarendon. JOHNSON. &lsquo;He is objected to for his parentheses, his involved clauses, and his want of harmony. But he is supported by his matter. It is, indeed, owing to a plethory of matter that his style is so faulty. Every <span class="t8">substance</span>, (smiling to Mr. Harris,) has so many <span class="t8">accidents</span>. &mdash; To be distinct, we must talk <span class="t8">analytically</span>. If we analyse language, we must speak of it grammatically; if we analyse argument, we must speak of it logically.&rsquo; GARRICK. &lsquo;Of all the translations that ever were attempted, I think Elphinston&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Martial</span> the most extraordinary. He consulted me upon it, who am a little of an epigrammatist myself, you know. I told him freely, &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t seem to have that turn.&rdquo; I asked him if he was serious; and finding he was, I advised him against publishing. Why, his translation is more difficult to understand than the original. I thought him a man of some talents; but he seems crazy in this.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, you have done what I had not courage to do. But he did not ask my advice, and I did not force it upon him, to make him angry with me.&rsquo; GARRICK. &lsquo;But as a friend, Sir&mdash; &lsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, such a friend as I am with him &mdash; no.&rsquo; GARRICK. &lsquo;But if you see a friend going to tumble over a precipice?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;That is an extravagant case, Sir. You are sure a friend will thank you for hindering him from tumbling over a precipice; but, in the other case, I should hurt his vanity, and do him no good. He would not take my advice. His brother-in-law, Strahan, sent him a subscription of fifty pounds, and said he would send him fifty more, if he would not publish.&rsquo; GARRICK. &lsquo;What! Is Strahan a good judge of an Epigram? Is not he rather an <span class="t8">obtuse</span> man, eh?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, he may not be a judge of an Epigram: but you see he is a judge of what is <span class="t8">not</span> an Epigram.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;It is easy for you, Mr. Garrick, to talk to an authour as you talked to Elphinston; you, who have been so long the manager of a theatre, rejecting the plays of poor authours. You are an old Judge, who have often pronounced sentence of death. You are a practiced surgeon, who have often amputated limbs; and though this may have been for the good of your patients, they cannot like you. Those who have undergone a dreadful operation, are not very fond of seeing the operator again.&rsquo; GARRICK. &lsquo;Yes, I know enough of that. There was a reverend gentleman, (Mr. Hawkins,) who wrote a tragedy, the SIEGE of something, which I refused.&rsquo; HARRIS. &lsquo;So, the siege was raised.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Ay, he came to me and complained; and told me, that Garrick said his play was wrong in the <span class="t8">concoction</span>. Now, what is the concoction of a play?&rsquo; (Here Garrick started, and twisted himself, and seemed sorely vexed; for Johnson told me, he believed the story was true.) GARRICK. &lsquo;I &mdash; I &mdash; I &mdash; said <span class="t8">first</span> concoction.&rsquo; JOHNSON: (smiling.) &lsquo;Well, he left out <span class="t8">first</span>. And Rich, he said, refused him <span class="t8">in false English</span>: he could shew it under his hand.&rsquo; GARRICK. &lsquo;He wrote to me in violent wrath, for having refused his play: &ldquo;Sir, this is growing a very serious and terrible affair. I am resolved to publish my play. I will appeal to the world; and how will your judgement appear?&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;Sir, notwithstanding all the seriousness, and all the terrours, I have no objection to your publishing your play; and as you live at a great distance, (Devonshire, I believe,) if you will send it to me, I will convey it to the press.&rdquo; I never heard more of it, ha! ha! ha!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Friday, April 10, I found Johnson at home in the morning. We resumed the conversation of yesterday. He put me in mind of some of it which had escaped my memory, and enabled me to record it more perfectly than I otherwise could have done. He was much pleased with my paying so great attention to his recommendation in 1763, the period when our acquaintance began, that I should keep a journal; and I could perceive he was secretly pleased to find so much of the fruit of his mind preserved; and as he had been used to imagine and say that he always laboured when he said a good thing &mdash; it delighted him, on a review, to find that his conversation teemed with point and imagery.</p>
<p class="p24">I said to him, &lsquo;You were yesterday, Sir, in remarkably good humour: but there was nothing to offend you, nothing to produce irritation or violence. There was no bold offender. There was not one capital conviction. It was a maiden assize. You had on your white gloves.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He found fault with our friend Langton for having been too silent. &lsquo;Sir, (said I,) you will recollect, that he very properly took up Sir Joshua for being glad that Charles Fox had praised Goldsmith&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Traveller</span>, and you joined him.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Yes, Sir, I knocked Fox on the head, without ceremony. Reynolds is too much under Fox and Burke at present. He is under the <span class="t8">Fox star</span> and the <span class="t8">Irish constellation</span>. He is always under some planet.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;There is no Fox star.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;But there is a dog star.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;They say, indeed, a fox and a dog are the same animal.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I reminded him of a gentleman, who, Mrs. Cholmondeley said, was first talkative from affectation, and then silent from the same cause; that he first thought, &lsquo;I shall be celebrated as the liveliest man in every company;&rsquo; and then, all at once, &lsquo;O! it is much more respectable to be grave and look wise.&rsquo; &lsquo;He has reversed the Pythagorean discipline, by being first talkative, and then silent. He reverses the course of Nature too: he was first the gay butterfly, and then the creeping worm.&rsquo; Johnson laughed loud and long at this expansion and illustration of what he himself had told me.</p>
<p class="p24">We dined together with Mr. Scott (now Sir William Scott, his Majesty&rsquo;s Advocate General,) at his chambers in the Temple, nobody else there. The company being small, Johnson was not in such spirits as he had been the preceding day, and for a considerable time little was said. At last he burst forth, &lsquo;Subordination is sadly broken down in this age. No man, now, has the same authority which his father had, &mdash; except a gaoler. No master has it over his servants: it is diminished in our colleges; nay, in our grammar-schools.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;What is the cause of this, Sir?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why the coming in of the Scotch,&rsquo; (laughing sarcastically). BOSWELL. &lsquo;That is to say, things have been turned topsy turvey. &mdash; But your serious cause.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, there are many causes, the chief of which is, I think, the great increase of money. No man now depends upon the Lord of a Manour, when he can send to another country, and fetch provisions. The shoe-black at the entry of my court does not depend on me. I can deprive him but of a penny a day, which he hopes somebody else will bring him; and that penny I must carry to another shoe-black, so the trade suffers nothing. I have explained, in my <span class="t8">Journey to the Hebrides</span>, how gold and silver destroy feudal subordination. But, besides, there is a general relaxation of reverence. No son now depends upon his father as in former times. Paternity used to be considered as of itself a great thing, which had a right to many claims. That is, in general, reduced to very small bounds. My hope is, that as anarchy produces tyranny, this extreme relaxation will produce <span class="t8">freni strictio</span>.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Talking of fame, for which there is so great a desire, I observed how little there is of it in reality, compared with the other objects of human attention. &lsquo;Let every man recollect, and he will be sensible how small a part of his time is employed in talking or thinking of Shakspeare, Voltaire, or any of the most celebrated men that have ever lived, or are now supposed to occupy the attention and admiration of the world. Let this be extracted and compressed; into what a narrow space will it go!&rsquo; I then slily introduced Mr. Garrick&rsquo;s fame, and his assuming the airs of a great man. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, it is wonderful how <span class="t8">little</span> Garrick assumes. No, Sir, Garrick <span class="t8">fortunam reverenter habet</span>. Consider, Sir: celebrated men, such as you have mentioned, have had their applause at a distance; but Garrick had it dashed in his face, sounded in his ears, and went home every night with the plaudits of a thousand in his <span class="t8">cranium</span>. Then, Sir, Garrick did not <span class="t8">find</span>, but <span class="t8">made</span> his way to the tables, the levees, and almost the bed-chambers of the great. Then, Sir, Garrick had under him a numerous body of people; who, from fear of his power, and hopes of his favour, and admiration of his talents, were constantly submissive to him. And here is a man who has advanced the dignity of his profession. Garrick has made a player a higher character.&rsquo; SCOTT. &lsquo;And he is a very sprightly writer too.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Yes, Sir; and all this supported by great wealth of his own acquisition. If all this had happened to me, I should have had a couple of fellows with long poles walking before me, to knock down every body that stood in the way. Consider, if all this had happened to Cibber or Quin they&rsquo;d have jumped over the moon. &mdash; Yet Garrick speaks to <span class="t8">us</span>.&rsquo; (smiling.) BOSWELL. &lsquo;And Garrick is a very good man, a charitable man.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, a liberal man. He has given away more money than any man in England. There may be a little vanity mixed; but he has shewn, that money is not his first object.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Yet Foote used to say of him, that he walked out with an intention to do a generous action; but, turning the corner of a street, he met with the ghost of a halfpenny, which frightened him.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, that is very true, too; for I never knew a man of whom it could be said with less certainty to-day, what he will do to-morrow, than Garrick; it depends so much on his humour at the time.&rsquo; SCOTT. &lsquo;I am glad to hear of his liberality. He has been represented as very saving.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;With his domestick saving we have nothing to do. I remember drinking tea with him long ago, when Peg Woffington made it, and he grumbled at her for making it too strong. He had then begun to feel money in his purse, and did not know when he should have enough of it.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On the subject of wealth, the proper use of it, and the effects of that art which is called oeconomy, he observed: &lsquo;It is wonderful to think how men of very large estates not only spend their yearly incomes, but are often actually in want of money. It is clear, they have not value for what they spend. Lord Shelburne told me, that a man of high rank, who looks into his own affairs, may have all that he ought to have, all that can be of any use, or appear with any advantage, for five thousand pounds a year. Therefore, a great proportion must go in waste; and, indeed, this is the case with most people, whatever their fortune is.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;I have no doubt, Sir, of this. But how is it? What is waste?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, breaking bottles, and a thousand other things. Waste cannot be accurately told, though we are sensible how destructive it is. OEconomy on the one hand, by which a certain income is made to maintain a man genteely, and waste on the other, by which, on the same income, another man lives shabbily, cannot be defined. It is a very nice thing: as one man wears his coat out much sooner than another, we cannot tell how.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">We talked of war. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Every man thinks meanly of himself for not having been a soldier, or not having been at sea.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Lord Mansfield does not.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, if Lord Mansfield were in a company of General Officers and Admirals who have been in service, he would shrink; he&rsquo;d wish to creep under the table.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;No; he&rsquo;d think he could <span class="t8">try</span> them all.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Yes, if he could catch them: but they&rsquo;d try him much sooner. No, Sir; were Socrates and Charles the Twelfth of Sweden both present in any company, and Socrates to say, &ldquo;Follow me, and hear a lecture on philosophy;&rdquo; and Charles, laying his hand on his sword, to say, &ldquo;Follow me, and dethrone the Czar;&rdquo; a man would be ashamed to follow Socrates. Sir, the impression is universal; yet it is strange. As to the sailor, when you look down from the quarter deck to the space below, you see the utmost extremity of human misery; such crouding, such filth, such stench!&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Yet sailors are happy.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;They are happy as brutes are happy, with a piece of fresh meat, &mdash; with the grossest sensuality. But, Sir, the profession of soldiers and sailors has the dignity of danger. Mankind reverence those who have got over fear, which is so general a weakness.&rsquo; SCOTT. &lsquo;But is not courage mechanical, and to be acquired?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why yes, Sir, in a collective sense. Soldiers consider themselves only as parts of a great machine.&rsquo; SCOTT. &lsquo;We find people fond of being sailors.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;I cannot account for that, any more than I can account for other strange perversions of imagination.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">His abhorrence of the profession of a sailor was uniformly violent; but in conversation he always exalted the profession of a soldier. And yet I have, in my large and various collection of his writings, a letter to an eminent friend, in which he expresses himself thus: &lsquo;My god-son called on me lately. He is weary, and rationally weary, of a military life. If you can place him in some other state, I think you may increase his happiness, and secure his virtue. A soldier&rsquo;s time is passed in distress and danger, or in idleness and corruption.&rsquo; Such was his cool reflection in his study; but whenever he was warmed and animated by the presence of company, he, like other philosophers, whose minds are impregnated with poetical fancy, caught the common enthusiasm for splendid renown.</p>
<p class="p24">He talked of Mr. Charles Fox, of whose abilities he thought highly, but observed, that he did not talk much at our CLUB. I have heard Mr. Gibbon remark, &lsquo;that Mr. Fox could not be afraid of Dr. Johnson; yet he certainly was very shy of saying any thing in Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s presence.&rsquo; Mr. Scott now quoted what was said of Alcibiades by a Greek poet, to which Johnson assented.</p>
<p class="p24">He told us, that he had given Mrs. Montagu a catalogue of all Daniel Defoe&rsquo;s works of imagination; most, if not all of which, as well as of his other works, he now enumerated, allowing a considerable share of merit to a man, who, bred a tradesman, had written so variously and so well. Indeed, his <span class="t8">Robinson Crusoe</span> is enough of itself to establish his reputation.</p>
<p class="p24">He expressed great indignation at the imposture of the Cocklane Ghost, and related, with much satisfaction, how he had assisted in detecting the cheat, and had published an account of it in the news-papers. Upon this subject I incautiously offended him, by pressing him with too many questions, and he shewed his displeasure. I apologised, saying that &lsquo;I asked questions in order to be instructed and entertained; I repaired eagerly to the fountain; but that the moment he gave me a hint, the moment he put a lock upon the well, I desisted.&rsquo;&mdash; &lsquo;But, Sir, (said he,) that is forcing one to do a disagreeable thing:&rsquo; and he continued to rate me. &lsquo;Nay, Sir, (said I,) when you have put a lock upon the well, so that I can no longer drink, do not make the fountain of your wit play upon me and wet me.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He sometimes could not bear being teazed with questions. I was once present when a gentleman asked so many as, &lsquo;What did you do, Sir?&rsquo; &lsquo;What did you say, Sir?&rsquo; that he at last grew enraged, and said, &lsquo;I will not be put to the <span class="t8">question</span>. Don&rsquo;t you consider, Sir, that these are not the manners of a gentleman? I will not be baited with <span class="t8">what</span>, and <span class="t8">why</span>; what is this? what is that? why is a cow&rsquo;s tail long? why is a fox&rsquo;s tail bushy?&rsquo; The gentleman, who was a good deal out of countenance, said, &lsquo;Why, Sir, you are so good, that I venture to trouble you.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, my being so <span class="t8">good</span> is no reason why you should be so <span class="t8">ill</span>.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Talking of the Justitia hulk at Woolwich, in which criminals were punished, by being confined to labour, he said, &lsquo;I do not see that they are punished by this: they must have worked equally had they never been guilty of stealing. They now only work; so, after all, they have gained; what they stole is clear gain to them; the confinement is nothing. Every man who works is confined: the smith to his shop, the tailor to his garret.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;And Lord Mansfield to his Court.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Yes, Sir, you know the notion of confinement may be extended, as in the song, &ldquo;Every island is a prison.&rdquo; There is, in Dodsley&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Collection</span>, a copy of verses to the authour of that song.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p26">Smith&rsquo;s Latin verses on Pococke, the great traveller, were mentioned.<br/>He repeated some of them, and said they were Smith&rsquo;s best verses.</p>
<p class="p24">He talked with an uncommon animation of travelling into distant countries; that the mind was enlarged by it, and that an acquisition of dignity of character was derived from it. He expressed a particular enthusiasm with respect to visiting the wall of China. I catched it for the moment, and said I really believed I should go and see the wall of China had I not children, of whom it was my duty to take care. &lsquo;Sir, (said he,) by doing so, you would do what would be of importance in raising your children to eminence. There would be a lustre reflected upon them from your spirit and curiosity. They would be at all times regarded as the children of a man who had gone to view the wall of China. I am serious, Sir.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">When we had left Mr. Scott&rsquo;s, he said, &lsquo;Will you go home with me?&rsquo; &lsquo;Sir, (said I,) it is late; but I&rsquo;ll go with you for three minutes.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Or <span class="t8">four</span>.&rsquo; We went to Mrs. Williams&rsquo;s room, where we found Mr. Allen the printer, who was the landlord of his house in Bolt-court, a worthy obliging man, and his very old acquaintance; and what was exceedingly amusing, though he was of a very diminutive size, he used, even in Johnson&rsquo;s presence, to imitate the stately periods and slow and solemn utterance of the great man. &mdash; I this evening boasted, that although I did not write what is called stenography, or short-hand, in appropriated characters devised for the purpose, I had a method of my own of writing half words, and leaving out some altogether so as yet to keep the substance and language of any discourse which I had heard so much in view, that I could give it very completely soon after I had taken it down. He defied me, as he had once defied an actual short-hand writer, and he made the experiment by reading slowly and distinctly a part of Robertson&rsquo;s <span class="t8">History of America</span>, while I endeavoured to write it in my way of taking notes. It was found that I had it very imperfectly; the conclusion from which was, that its excellence was principally owing to a studied arrangement of words, which could not be varied or abridged without an essential injury.</p>
<p class="p24">On Sunday, April 12, I found him at home before dinner; Dr. Dodd&rsquo;s poem entitled <span class="t8">Thoughts in Prison</span> was lying upon his table. This appearing to me an extraordinary effort by a man who was in Newgate for a capital crime, I was desirous to hear Johnson&rsquo;s opinion of it: to my surprize, he told me he had not read a line of it. I took up the book and read a passage to him. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Pretty well, if you are previously disposed to like them.&rsquo; I read another passage, with which he was better pleased. He then took the book into his own hands, and having looked at the prayer at the end of it, he said, &lsquo;What <span class="t8">evidence</span> is there that this was composed the night before he suffered? <span class="t8">I</span> do not believe it.&rsquo; He then read aloud where he prays for the King, &amp;c. and observed, &lsquo;Sir, do you think that a man the night before he is to be hanged cares for the succession of a royal family? &mdash; Though, he <span class="t8">may</span> have composed this prayer, then. A man who has been canting all his life, may cant to the last. &mdash; And yet a man who has been refused a pardon after so much petitioning, would hardly be praying thus fervently for the King.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He and I, and Mrs. Williams, went to dine with the Reverend Dr. Percy. Talking of Goldsmith, Johnson said, he was very envious. I defended him, by observing that he owned it frankly upon all occasions. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, you are enforcing the charge. He had so much envy, that he could not conceal it. He was so full of it that he overflowed. He talked of it to be sure often enough. Now, Sir, what a man avows, he is not ashamed to think; though many a man thinks, what he is ashamed to avow. We are all envious naturally; but by checking envy, we get the better of it. So we are all thieves naturally; a child always tries to get at what it wants, the nearest way; by good instruction and good habits this is cured, till a man has not even an inclination to seize what is another&rsquo;s; has no struggle with himself about it.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">And here I shall record a scene of too much heat between Dr. Johnson and Dr. Percy, which I should have suppressed, were it not that it gave occasion to display the truely tender and benevolent heart of Johnson, who, as soon as he found a friend was at all hurt by any thing which he had &lsquo;said in his wrath,&rsquo; was not only prompt and desirous to be reconciled, but exerted himself to make ample reparation.</p>
<p class="p24">Books of Travels having been mentioned, Johnson praised Pennant very highly, as he did at Dunvegan, in the Isle of Sky. Dr. Percy, knowing himself to be the heir male of the ancient Percies, and having the warmest and most dutiful attachment to the noble House of Northumberland, could not sit quietly and hear a man praised, who had spoken disrespectfully of Alnwick-Castle and the Duke&rsquo;s pleasure grounds, especially as he thought meanly of his travels. He therefore opposed Johnson eagerly. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Pennant in what he has said of Alnwick, has done what he intended; he has made you very angry.&rsquo; PERCY. &lsquo;He has said the garden is <span class="t8">trim</span>, which is representing it like a citizen&rsquo;s parterre, when the truth is, there is a very large extent of fine turf and gravel walks.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;According to your own account, Sir, Pennant is right. It <span class="t8">is</span> trim. Here is grass cut close, and gravel rolled smooth. Is not that trim? The extent is nothing against that; a mile may be as trim as a square yard. Your extent puts me in mind of the citizen&rsquo;s enlarged dinner, two pieces of roast-beef, and two puddings. There is no variety, no mind exerted in laying out the ground, no trees.&rsquo; PERCY. &lsquo;He pretends to give the natural history of Northumberland, and yet takes no notice of the immense number of trees planted there of late.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;That, Sir, has nothing to do with the <span class="t8">natural history</span>; that is <span class="t8">civil</span> history. A man who gives the natural history of the oak, is not to tell how many oaks have been planted in this place or that. A man who gives the natural history of the cow, is not to tell how many cows are milked at Islington. The animal is the same, whether milked in the Park or at Islington.&rsquo; PERCY. &lsquo;Pennant does not describe well; a carrier who goes along the side of Lochlomond would describe it better.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;I think he describes very well.&rsquo; PERCY. &lsquo;I travelled after him.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;And <span class="t8">I</span> travelled after him.&rsquo; PERCY. &lsquo;But, my good friend, you are short-sighted, and do not see so well as I do.&rsquo; I wondered at Dr. Percy&rsquo;s venturing thus. Dr. Johnson said nothing at the time; but inflammable particles were collecting for a cloud to burst. In a little while Dr. Percy said something more in disparagement of Pennant. JOHNSON. (pointedly) &lsquo;This is the resentment of a narrow mind, because he did not find every thing in Northumberland.&rsquo; PERCY. (feeling the stroke) &lsquo;Sir, you may be as rude as you please.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Hold, Sir! Don&rsquo;t talk of rudeness; remember, Sir, you told me (puffing hard with passion struggling for a vent) I was short-sighted. We have done with civility. We are to be as rude as we please.&rsquo; PERCY. &lsquo;Upon my honour, Sir, I did not mean to be uncivil.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;I cannot say so, Sir; for I <span class="t8">did</span> mean to be uncivil, thinking <span class="t8">you</span> had been uncivil.&rsquo; Dr. Percy rose, ran up to him, and taking him by the hand, assured him affectionately that his meaning had been misunderstood; upon which a reconciliation instantly took place. JOHNSON. &lsquo;My dear Sir, I am willing you shall <span class="t8">hang</span> Pennant.&rsquo; PERCY. (resuming the former subject) &lsquo;Pennant complains that the helmet is not hung out to invite to the hall of hospitality. Now I never heard that it was a custom to hang out a <span class="t8">helmet</span>.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Hang him up, hang him up.&rsquo; BOSWELL. (humouring the joke) &lsquo;Hang out his skull instead of a helmet, and you may drink ale out of it in your hall of Odin, as he is your enemy; that will be truly ancient. <span class="t8">There</span> will be <span class="t8">Northern Antiquities</span>.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;He&rsquo;s a <span class="t8">Whig</span>, Sir; a <span class="t8">sad dog</span>. (smiling at his own violent expressions, merely for <span class="t8">political</span> difference of opinion.) But he&rsquo;s the best traveller I ever read; he observes more things than any one else does.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I could not help thinking that this was too high praise of a writer who had traversed a wide extent of country in such haste, that he could put together only curt frittered fragments of his own, and afterwards procured supplemental intelligence from parochial ministers, and others not the best qualified or most impartial narrators, whose ungenerous prejudice against the house of Stuart glares in misrepresentation; a writer, who at best treats merely of superficial objects, and shews no philosophical investigation of character and manners, such as Johnson has exhibited in his masterly <span class="t8">Journey</span>, over part of the same ground; and who it should seem from a desire of ingratiating himself with the Scotch, has flattered the people of North-Britain so inordinately and with so little discrimination, that the judicious and candid amongst them must be disgusted, while they value more the plain, just, yet kindly report of Johnson.</p>
<p class="p24">Having impartially censured Mr. Pennant, as a Traveller in Scotland, let me allow him, from authorities much better than mine, his deserved praise as an able Zoologist; and let me also from my own understanding and feelings, acknowledge the merit of his <span class="t8">London</span>, which, though said to be not quite accurate in some particulars, is one of the most pleasing topographical performances that ever appeared in any language. Mr. Pennant, like his countrymen in general, has the true spirit of a <span class="t8">Gentleman</span>. As a proof of it, I shall quote from his <span class="t8">London</span> the passage, in which he speaks of my illustrious friend. &lsquo;I must by no means omit <span class="t8">Bolt-court</span>, the long residence of Doctor SAMUEL JOHNSON, a man of the strongest natural abilities, great learning, a most retentive memory, of the deepest and most unaffected piety and morality, mingled with those numerous weaknesses and prejudices which his friends have kindly taken care to draw from their dread abode. I brought on myself his transient anger, by observing that in his tour in <span class="t8">Scotland</span>, he once had &ldquo;long and woeful experience of oats being the food of men in <span class="t8">Scotland</span> as they were of horses in <span class="t8">England</span>.&rdquo;&rsquo; It was a national reflection unworthy of him, and I shot my bolt. In return he gave me a tender hug. <span class="t8">Con amore</span> he also said of me &lsquo;<span class="t8">The dog is a Whig</span>;&rsquo; I admired the virtues of Lord <span class="t8">Russell</span>, and pitied his fall. I should have been a Whig at the Revolution. There have been periods since, in which I should have been, what I now am, a moderate Tory, a supporter, as far as my little influence extends, of a well-poised balance between the crown and people: but should the scale preponderate against the <span class="t8">Salus populi</span>, that moment may it be said &lsquo;<span class="t8">The dog&rsquo;s a Whig</span>!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">We had a calm after the storm, staid the evening and supped, and were pleasant and gay. But Dr. Percy told me he was very uneasy at what had passed; for there was a gentleman there who was acquainted with the Northumberland family, to whom he hoped to have appeared more respectable, by shewing how intimate he was with Dr. Johnson, and who might now, on the contrary, go away with an opinion to his disadvantage. He begged I would mention this to Dr. Johnson, which I afterwards did. His observation upon it was, &lsquo;This comes of <span class="t8">stratagem</span>; had he told me that he wished to appear to advantage before that gentleman, he should have been at the top of the house, all the time.&rsquo; He spoke of Dr. Percy in the handsomest terms. &lsquo;Then, Sir, (said I,) may I be allowed to suggest a mode by which you may effectually counteract any unfavourable report of what passed. I will write a letter to you upon the subject of the unlucky contest of that day, and you will be kind enough to put in writing as an answer to that letter, what you have now said, and as Lord Percy is to dine with us at General Paoli&rsquo;s soon, I will take an opportunity to read the correspondence in his Lordship&rsquo;s presence.&rsquo; This friendly scheme was accordingly carried into execution without Dr. Percy&rsquo;s knowledge. Johnson&rsquo;s letter placed Dr. Percy&rsquo;s unquestionable merit in the fairest point of view; and I contrived that Lord Percy should hear the correspondence, by introducing it at General Paoli&rsquo;s, as an instance of Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s kind disposition towards one in whom his Lordship was interested. Thus every unfavourable impression was obviated that could possibly have been made on those by whom he wished most to be regarded. I breakfasted the day after with him, and informed him of my scheme, and its happy completion, for which he thanked me in the warmest terms, and was highly delighted with Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s letter in his praise, of which I gave him a copy. He said, &lsquo;I would rather have this than degrees from all the Universities in Europe. It will be for me, and my children and grand-children.&rsquo; Dr. Johnson having afterwards asked me if I had given him a copy of it, and being told I had, was offended, and insisted that I should get it back, which I did. As, however, he did not desire me to destroy either the original or the copy, or forbid me to let it be seen, I think myself at liberty to apply to it his general declaration to me concerning his other letters, &lsquo;That he did not choose they should be published in his lifetime; but had no objection to their appearing after his death.&rsquo; I shall therefore insert this kindly correspondence, having faithfully narrated the circumstances accompanying it.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To DR. SAMUEL JOHNSON.</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">&lsquo;MY DEAR SIR,</span></p>
<p class="p21">&lsquo;I beg leave to address you in behalf of our friend Dr. Percy, who was much hurt by what you said to him that day we dined at his house; when, in the course of the dispute as to Pennant&rsquo;s merit as a traveller, you told Percy that &ldquo;he had the resentment of a narrow mind against Pennant, because he did not find every thing in Northumberland.&rdquo; Percy is sensible that you did not mean to injure him; but he is vexed to think that your behaviour to him upon that occasion may be interpreted as a proof that he is despised by you, which I know is not the case. I have told him, that the charge of being narrow-minded was only as to the particular point in question; and that he had the merit of being a martyr to his noble family.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Earl Percy is to dine with General Paoli next Friday; and I should be sincerely glad to have it in my power to satisfy his Lordship how well you think of Dr. Percy, who, I find, apprehends that your good opinion of him may be of very essential consequence; and who assures me, that he has the highest respect and the warmest affection for you.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I have only to add, that my suggesting this occasion for the exercise of your candour and generosity, is altogether unknown to Dr. Percy, and proceeds from my good-will towards him, and my persuasion that you will be happy to do him an essential kindness. I am, more and more, my dear Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your most faithful</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;And affectionate humble servant,</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;JAMES BOSWELL.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p10">* * * * *</p>
<p class="p21">&lsquo;To JAMES BOSWELL, ESQ.</p>
<p class="p27">&lsquo;SIR,</p>
