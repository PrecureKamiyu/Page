In defining NFS, Sun took an unusual approach: in- stead of building a proprietary and closed system, Sun instead developed an <b>open protocol </b>which simply specified the exact message formats that clients and servers would use to communicate. Different groups could develop their own NFS servers and thus compete in an NFS marketplace while preserving interoperability. It worked: today there are many com- panies that sell NFS servers (including Oracle/Sun, NetApp [HLM94], EMC, IBM, and others), and the widespread success of NFS is likely at- tributed to this “open market” approach.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part520.htm">&lt; 上一个</a><span> | </span><a href="../ostep.html">内容</a><span> | </span><a href="part522.htm">下一个 &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
