<title>III. THE STUDY OF MACAULAY</title>

<h2 class="h20"><a id="a2710"></a>III. THE STUDY OF MACAULAY</h2>
<p class="p21">Once for all it must be remembered that Macaulay had no intention of being studied as a text-book, and we must deal with him fairly. First we should read the <span class="t8">Life</span> through at a sitting without consulting a note, just as we read an article in the <span class="t8">Atlantic Monthly</span> or the <span class="t8">Encyclop√¶dia Britannica</span>. We should rush on with the &ldquo;torrent of words&rdquo; to the end to see what it is all about, and to get an impression of the article as a whole. As Johnson says: &ldquo;Let him that is yet unacquainted with the powers of Shakespeare, and who desires to feel the highest pleasure that the drama can give, read every play from the first scene to the last with utter negligence of all his commentators. When his fancy is once on the wing, let it not stoop at correction or explanation. When his attention is strongly engaged let it disdain alike to turn aside to the name of Theobald and of Pope. Let him read on through brightness and obscurity, through integrity and corruption; let him preserve his comprehension of the dialogue and his interest in the fable. And when the pleasures of novelty have ceased let him attempt exactness and read the commentators.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Macaulay attracts attention not only to what he says but also to the way in which he says it. In examining his style it will be a good plan to ask ourselves whether the writer ever wanders from the subject, or whether every part of the <span class="t8">Life</span> contributes something to the one subject under discussion. Naturally we find ourselves making topics, such for example as Johnson&rsquo;s Youth, His Father, At Oxford. A list of these topics gives us a bird&rsquo;s-eye view of the whole field and enables us to examine the composition more critically. Has the writer arranged the topics in the natural order? Does he give too much space to the treatment of any one topic? Might any of them be omitted to advantage?</p>
<p class="p24">Having examined the larger divisions, we may profitably turn our attention to the parts which constitute these divisions, the paragraphs. First let us see whether he goes easily from one paragraph to the next. For example, is the first sentence of paragraph 2 a good connecting link with what precedes? In looking through the <span class="t8">Life</span> for these links, we should make up our minds whether they are studied or spontaneous.</p>
<p class="p24">Then let us test the unity of the paragraphs. Can each paragraph be summed up in a single sentence? Does a combination of the opening and the closing sentence ever serve the purpose? Does one or the other of these ever answer of itself? Has every sentence some bearing on the main thought, or might some sentences be omitted as well as not?</p>
<p class="p24">It will be equally profitable, at this point, to test the coherence of half a dozen paragraphs. Does each sentence lead up naturally to the next? Can the order of sentences be changed to advantage? When the sentences in a paragraph hold together firmly, we should point out the cause; when coherence is lacking, we should try to discover to what its absence is due.</p>
<p class="p24">Then comes the question of emphasis. Let us see whether we can find two or three paragraphs in which Macaulay succeeds particularly well in emphasizing the main point. If we find three, let us see whether he accomplishes his purpose in the same way each time.</p>
<p class="p24">For those of us who are still willing to learn something from Macaulay&rsquo;s style, it is worth while to study the sentences. Selecting two or three of the most interesting paragraphs, we may make the three tests: (1) Is each sentence a unit? (2) Is the relation of every word to the adjoining words absolutely clear? (3) Does the construction emphasize what is important?</p>
<p class="p24">Then there is the vocabulary. Who does not enjoy the feeling that he is enlarging his vocabulary? An easy way of doing it is to read two or three times such a paragraph as the nineteenth, and then, with the book closed, to write as much of it as possible from memory. As it is not merely a large vocabulary that we wish, but a well chosen one, we shall do well to compare our version with Macaulay&rsquo;s and see in how many cases his word is better than ours. Have we, for example, equaled &ldquo;winning affability,&rdquo; or &ldquo;London mud,&rdquo; or &ldquo;inhospitable door&rdquo;? Is his word more effective than ours because it is more specific, or what is the reason?</p>
<p class="p24">Before taking farewell of the <span class="t8">Life of Johnson</span> there is another use to which we may put the topics. We may use them as tests of our knowledge of the essay. If we can write or talk fully and definitely on each of the more important ones, we are sure to carry much food for thought away with us. The value of a review of this sort is evident from a glance at the following topics: Literary Life in London in Johnson&rsquo;s Time, Johnson&rsquo;s Love Affair, The Dictionary, The Turning Point in Johnson&rsquo;s Life, The Rambler, Rasselas, The Idler, His Shakspere, The Club [His Conversation], Boswell, The Thrales, His Fleet Street Establishment, The Lives of the Poets.</p>
<p class="p24">As we read Macaulay we should be particularly careful to think for ourselves. Mr. Gladstone has said: &ldquo;Wherever and whenever read, he will be read with fascination, with delight, with wonder. And with copious instruction too; but also with copious reserve, with questioning scrutiny, with liberty to reject, and with much exercise of that liberty.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">This means that we must follow him up, find out where he got his information, see whether in his enthusiasm he has exaggerated. Then, even if the critics do assure us that he is not one of the deep thinkers, one of the very great writers, we may go on committing his <span class="t8">Lays</span> to heart, studying his <span class="t8">Essays</span>, and admiring those wonderfully faithful pictures in his <span class="t8">History</span>. More than all else, as the years go by, we are likely to find ourselves indebted to him for arousing interest, for leading us to further reading.</p>
