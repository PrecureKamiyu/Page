      </h2>
      
      
      
      <p class="noind">This book is an in-depth guide to the concurrency and multithreading facilities from the new C++ Standard, from the basic
         usage of <kbd class="calibre17">std::thread</kbd>, <kbd class="calibre17">std::mutex</kbd>, and <kbd class="calibre17">std:: async</kbd>, to the complexities of atomic operations and the memory model.

      </h3>
      
      <p class="noind">The first four chapters introduce the various library facilities provided by the library and show how they can be used.</p>
      
      <p class="noind"><a href="kindle_split_015.html#ch05" class="calibre4">Chapter 5</a> covers the low-level nitty-gritty of the memory model and atomic operations, including how atomic operations can be used
         to impose ordering constraints on other code, and marks the end of the introductory chapters.
      </p>
      
      <p class="noind"><a href="kindle_split_016.html#ch06" class="calibre4">Chapters 6</a> and <a href="kindle_split_017.html#ch07" class="calibre4">7</a> start the coverage of higher-level topics, with some examples of how to use the basic facilities to build more complex data
         structures—lock-based data structures in <a href="kindle_split_016.html#ch06" class="calibre4">chapter 6</a>, and lock-free data structures in <a href="kindle_split_017.html#ch07" class="calibre4">chapter 7</a>.
      </p>
      
      <p class="noind"><a href="kindle_split_018.html#ch08" class="calibre4">Chapter 8</a> continues the higher-level topics, with guidelines for designing multithreaded code, coverage of the issues that affect performance,
         and example implementations of various parallel algorithms.
      </p>
      
      <p class="noind"><a href="kindle_split_019.html#ch09" class="calibre4">Chapter 9</a> covers thread management—thread pools, work queues, and interrupting operations.
      </p>
      
      <p class="noind"><a href="kindle_split_020.html#ch10" class="calibre4">Chapter 10</a> covers the new parallelism support from C++17, which comes in the form of additional overloads for many of the Standard Library
         algorithms.
      </p>
      
      <p class="noind"><a href="kindle_split_021.html#ch11" class="calibre4">Chapter 11</a> covers testing and debugging—types of bugs, techniques for locating them, how to test for them, and so forth.
      </p>
      
      <p class="noind">The appendixes include a brief description of some of the new language facilities introduced with the new standard that are
         relevant to multithreading, the implementation details of the message-passing library mentioned in <a href="kindle_split_014.html#ch04" class="calibre4">chapter 4</a>, and a complete reference to the C++17 Thread Library.
      </p>
      
      
      
      <h3 id="pref04lev1sec2" class="chapter"><a id="pref04lev1sec2__title" class="calibre3"></a>Who should read this book
      </h3>
      
      <p class="noind">If you’re writing multithreaded code in C++, you should read this book. If you’re using the new multithreading facilities
         from the C++ Standard Library, this book is an essential guide. If you’re using alternative thread libraries, the guidelines
         and techniques from the later chapters should still prove useful.
      </p>
      
      <p class="noind">A good working knowledge of C++ is assumed, though familiarity with the new language features is not—these are covered in
         <a href="kindle_split_022.html#app01" class="calibre4">appendix A</a>. Prior knowledge or experience of multithreaded programming is not assumed, though it may be useful.
      </p>
      
      
      
      <h3 id="pref04lev1sec3" class="chapter"><a id="pref04lev1sec3__title" class="calibre3"></a>How to use this book
      </h3>
      
      <p class="noind">If you’ve never written multithreaded code before, I suggest reading this book sequentially from beginning to end, though
         possibly skipping the more detailed parts of <a href="kindle_split_015.html#ch05" class="calibre4">chapter 5</a>. <a href="kindle_split_017.html#ch07" class="calibre4">Chapter 7</a> relies heavily on the material in <a href="kindle_split_015.html#ch05" class="calibre4">chapter 5</a>, so if you skipped <a href="kindle_split_015.html#ch05" class="calibre4">chapter 5</a>, you should save <a href="kindle_split_017.html#ch07" class="calibre4">chapter 7</a> until you’ve read it.
      </p>
      
      <p class="noind">If you haven’t used the new C++11 language facilities before, it might be worth skimming <a href="kindle_split_022.html#app01" class="calibre4">appendix A</a> before you start to ensure that you’re up to speed with the examples in the book. The uses of the new language facilities
         are highlighted in the text, though, and you can always flip to the appendix if you encounter something you haven’t seen before.
      </p>
      
      <p class="noind">If you have extensive experience with writing multithreaded code in other environments, the beginning chapters are probably
         still worth skimming so you can see how the facilities you know map onto the new standard C++ ones. If you’re going to be
         doing any low-level work with atomic variables, <a href="kindle_split_015.html#ch05" class="calibre4">chapter 5</a> is a must. <a href="kindle_split_018.html#ch08" class="calibre4">Chapter 8</a> is worth reviewing to ensure that you’re familiar with things like exception safety in multithreaded C++. If you have a particular
         task in mind, the index and table of contents should help you find a relevant section quickly.
      </p>
      
      <p class="noind">Once you’re up to speed on the use of the C++ Thread Library, <a href="kindle_split_025.html#app04" class="calibre4">appendix D</a> should continue to be useful, such as for looking up the exact details of each class and function call. You may also like
         to dip back into the main chapters from time to time to refresh your memory on a particular construct or to look at the sample
         code.
      </p>
      
      
      
      <h3 id="pref04lev1sec4" class="chapter"><a id="pref04lev1sec4__title" class="calibre3"></a>Code conventions and downloads
      </h3>
      
      <p class="noind">All source code in listings or in text is in a <kbd class="calibre17">fixed-width font like this</kbd> to separate it from ordinary text. Code annotations accompany many of the listings, highlighting important concepts. In some
         cases, numbered bullets link to explanations that follow the listing.

      <p class="noind">Source code for all working examples in this book is available for download from the publisher’s website at <a href="http://www.manning.com/books/c-plus-plus-concurrency-in-action-second-edition" class="calibre4">www.manning.com/books/c-plus-plus-concurrency-in-action-second-edition</a>.

      </h3>
      
      <p class="noind">To use the code from this book unchanged, you’ll need a recent C++ compiler that supports the C++17 language features used
         in the examples (see <a href="kindle_split_022.html#app01" class="calibre4">appendix A</a>), and you’ll need a copy of the C++ Standard Thread Library.
      </p>
      
      <p class="noind">At the time of writing, the latest versions of g++, clang++, and Microsoft Visual Studio all ship with implementations of
         the C++17 Standard Thread Library. They also support most of the language features from the appendix, and those features that
         aren’t supported are coming soon.
      </p>
      
      <p class="noind">My company, Just Software Solutions Ltd, sells a complete implementation of the C++11 Standard Thread Library for several
         older compilers, along with an implementation of the Concurrency TS for newer versions of clang, gcc, and Microsoft Visual
         Studio.<sup class="calibre18">[<a href="#pref04fn01" class="calibre4">1</a>]</sup> This implementation has been used for testing the examples in this book.

      <p class="noind">The Boost Thread Library<sup class="calibre18">[<a href="#pref04fn02" class="calibre4">2</a>]</sup> provides an API that’s based on the C++11 Standard Thread Library proposals and is portable to many platforms. Most of the
         examples from the book can be modified to work with the Boost Thread Library by judicious replacement of <kbd class="calibre17">std::</kbd> with <kbd class="calibre17">boost::</kbd> and use of the appropriate <kbd class="calibre17">#include</kbd> directives. There are a few facilities that are either not supported (such as <kbd class="calibre17">std::async</kbd>) or have different names (such as <kbd class="calibre17">boost::unique_future</kbd>) in the Boost Thread Library.
