<p class="p21">Whilst working on his Dictionary, Johnson also wrote various essays, sermons and poems during this fruitful nine year period. He also decided to produce a series of essays under the title <span class="t8">The Rambler</span> that would run every Tuesday and Saturday from 1750 to 1752, sold at twopence each. Explaining the title years later, he told his friend, the painter Joshua Reynolds: &ldquo;I was at a loss how to name it. I sat down at night upon my bedside, and resolved that I would not go to sleep till I had fixed its title. <span class="t8">The Rambler</span> seemed the best that occurred, and I took it&rdquo;. These essays, often on moral and religious topics, tended to be graver than the title of the series would suggest; his first comments in <span class="t8">The Rambler</span> were to ask &ldquo;that in this undertaking thy Holy Spirit may not be withheld from me, but that I may promote thy glory and the salvation of myself and others&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="p22">Johnson wrote 208 articles for <span class="t8">The Rambler, </span>which was<span class="t8"> </span>his most consistent and sustained work in his literary career. Though similar in name to preceding publications such as <span class="t8">The Spectator</span> and <span class="t8">The Tatler</span>, Johnson ensured that his periodical was unique by using a style of prose which differed from that of the time period. The most popular publications of the day were written in colloquial language of the people, whereas <span class="t8">The Rambler</span> was written in elevated prose. As was then common for the type of publication, the subject matter was confined only to the imagination of the author and discussed subjects such as morality, literature, society, politics and religion. Johnson included quotations and ideas in his publication from Renaissance humanists such as Erasmus and Descartes. </p>
<p class="p22"><span class="t8">The Rambler</span> was written primarily for the newfound, rising middle-class of the 18th century, who sought social fluency within aristocratic social circles. It was especially targeted to the middle-class audience that were increasingly marrying into aristocratic families in order to create alliances, but did not possess the social and intellectual tools to integrate into those higher social circles that required great understanding of subjects. </p>
