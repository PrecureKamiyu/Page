<p class="p21">This is a series of 103 essays, with all but twelve of them by Johnson, which were published in the London weekly the <span class="t8">Universal Chronicle</span> between 1758 and 1760. The periodical was most likely printed for the sole purpose of including <span class="t8">The Idler</span>, since it had produced only one issue before the series began and ceased publication when it finished. Johnson explains that he chose the pen name &lsquo;Idler&rsquo; as, &ldquo;Every man is or hopes to be, an Idler.&rdquo; The authors besides Johnson were Thomas Warton, Bennet Langton and the artist Joshua Reynolds. Johnson&rsquo;s biographer, James Boswell, later recalled that Johnson wrote some of the essays in <span class="t8">The Idler</span> &ldquo;as hastily as an ordinary letter&rdquo;. Boswell also remarked that once while visiting Oxford, Johnson composed an essay due for publication the next day in the half-hour before the last post was collected.</p>
<p class="p22">The essays were so popular that other publications began reprinting them without permission, prompting Johnson to insert a notice in the <span class="t8">Universal Chronicle</span> threatening to do the same to his competitors&rsquo; material and give the profits to London&rsquo;s prostitutes. When <span class="t8">The Idler</span> appeared in book form, one of Johnson&rsquo;s essays, &ldquo;The Vulture&rdquo;, was omitted, apparently because its anti-war satire was felt to be seditious. Johnson replaced it with an essay on the imprisonment of debtors.</p>
