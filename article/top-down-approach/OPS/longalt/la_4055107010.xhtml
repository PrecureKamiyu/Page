These are positioned side-by-side and are described from left to right. Each has a dotted arrow extending vertically below them (including two for the two laptops in "All other nodes") representing the passage of time.</p><p id="P700101195200000000000000000B382" data-uri="M07_KURO4140_07_SE_C07.xhtml#P700101195200000000000000000B382">A very small portion of the source's timeline is labeled "DIFS," followed by a thin blue band that extends diagonally downward to the right to the destination's timeline. There is a slight gap labeled "SIFS" followed by two thin blue bands that extend diagonally downward from the destination's timeline leftward to the source's timeline and rightward to all other nodes' timelines. There is a slight gap in the source's timeline, followed by a thick blue band labeled "DATA" that extends diagonally rightward to the destination's timeline. This portion of the all other nodes timeline is labeled "Defer access." There is a short gap in the destination's timeline labeled "SIFS," followed by two thin blue bands, both labeled "ACK," that extend diagonally downward from the destination's timeline leftward to the source and rightward to all other nodes.</p></div></section></body></html>
