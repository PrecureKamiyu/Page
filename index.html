				<h1>This is homepage.</h1>
				<p style="font-family:Times New Roman;">I'm gonna fill in positive energy everyday. This paragraph should be in <b>Times New Roman</b> font (others articles could be in <b style="font-family:'Neo Euler';">Neo-Euler</b> font). If not, please install the font on your device. </p>
				<p><b>Note</b>: If you haven't configured the default font in your browser, the articles converted from <code>org</code>  will look considerably ugly. <code>code</code> should be in <code>Consolas</code> font.</p>
				<p><b>Yet Another Note</b>: <code>text-align: justify;</code> which is to say that the text is double alignment, which could be considerably ugly under certain circumstances.</p>

                <p>Literally nothing...Man! People do nothing everyday.</p>
                <p>Hey I learnt some cool stuffs about the <code>org mode</code>. It is so cool. Do you know that MathJax is employed by default when you export the org mode file to html file? Insane. Highly productive! Emacs should introduce a Vim mode to edit file. I will never turn off Emacs if there were such thing.</p>
                <p>Hey I just learnt that you can check the help documentation of the current mode by pressing <code>C-h m</code>.</p>
                <p>Yet another paragraph. You should try using <code>yasnippets</code>. It would be better if I can find its documentation. And I become kinda insterested to the study of colors. Everybody knows that the color in WEP is great. But the questions is how to describe how good it is. On the other hand, after watching the ep.2 of U149, I realized that color is seldon mentioned.</p>

           		<h1>What did I do <time datetime="2023-04-18">today</time>(2023-04-18)?</h1>
				<p>Literally nothing...</p>
				<p>I wrote the note on <a href="art/note/j09.html" target="_blank">Chapter 09</a>. What a shame...</p>

				<h1>What did I do <time datetime="2023-04-17">today</time>(2023-04-17)?</h1>
				<p>Literally nothing.</p>
				<p>I wrote three chapters of Java. They are shit, for sure. Here are the links to them.</p>
				<ul>
					<li><a href="art/note/j06.html">Chapter 06</a></li>
					<li><a href="art/note/j07.html">Chapter 07</a></li>
					<li><a href="art/note/j08.html">Chapter 08</a></li>
				</ul>
				<p>They are indeed piece of shit.
				    <p>Chapter 06 is about black box and white box testing. </p>
				    <p>Chapter 07 is about <code>Set</code> and <code>List</code> class in Java. And is about the <b>Strategy pattern</b> and <b>iterator pattern</b>.</p>
				    <p>Chapter 08 is about <code>DAO</code> and file manipulations. We use <code>DAO</code> to manage the storation of the data. And we use file manipulation to implement the <code>DAO</code> using file system, to do which we need to know the manipulations on files. Lastly, we learnt <b>serialization</b>, we can use which to write objects to local files. When doing it, we shall use a list (you may call it container) to store those objects and write the container to the local file.</p>
				    <p>And I have to say that <code>org mode</code> is not that pleasing. What a pile of shit. Hard to use. And the manual is like shit. Everybody knows that an enumeration is like shit, but the manual has only enumerations.</p>

				    <h1>What did I do <time datetime="2023-04-16">today</time>(2023-04-16)?</h1>
				    <p><b>Literally nothing</b>.</p>
				    <p>I finish doing some of homework. What a complete shit. What a waste of life. Shit.</p>
				    <p>Ok, I learned what is <b>Lagrange interpolation</b> and what is <b>Newton interpolation</b>. Okay that is all. MG.</p>

				    <h1>What did I do <time datetime="2023-04-15">today</time>(2023-04-15)?</h1>
				    <p>Literally nothing</p>
				    <p>But I read the first three episode of <b>金瓶梅</b>. <b>Ep</b>.3 is great. And I just learn what is an <b>auxiliary verb</b>. And I just installed a extension for web browser to employ vim keybinding in browser.</p>

				    <h1>What did I do <time datetime="2023-04-14">today</time>?</h1>

				    <h2>I learned a little bit Japanese.</h2>
				    <p>I admit, linguistics is boring. I mean, to be honest, I don't care about the
				        genetic affiliation of Japanese or anything about Old Japanese. </p>
				    <p>You may check the article named <cite>book_01_intro</cite> in <a href="art/japanese.html" target="_blank">Japanese</a>.</p>

				    <h1>What did I do today?</h1>
				    <h2>I wrote an article about how to edit cards in Anki.</h2>
				    <ul>
					    <li><a href="art/anki_editing.html" target="_blank">Anki</a></li>
				    </ul>

				    <h2>I wrote a little about the branch prediction and exceptions</h2>
