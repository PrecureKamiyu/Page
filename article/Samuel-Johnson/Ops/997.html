<p class="p24">(<span class="t8">Page</span> 115, <span class="t8">note</span> 4.)</p>
<p class="p24">There are at least three accounts of this altercation and three versions of the lines. Two of these versions nearly agree. The earliest is found in a letter by Richard Burke, senior, dated Jan. 6, 1773 (<span class="t8">Burke Corres</span>. i. 403); the second in <span class="t8">The Annual Register</span> for 1776, p. 223; and the third in Miss Reynolds&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Recollections</span> (Croker&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Boswell</span>, 8vo. p. 833). R. Burke places the scene in Reynolds&rsquo;s house. Whether he himself was present is not clear. &lsquo;The dean,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;asserted that after forty-five a man did not improve. &ldquo;I differ with you, Sir,&rdquo; answered Johnson; &ldquo;a man may improve, and you yourself have great room for improvement.&rdquo; The dean was confounded, and for the instant silent. Recovering, he said, &ldquo;On recollection I see no cause to alter my opinion, except I was to call it improvement for a man to grow (which I allow he may) positive, rude, and insolent, and save arguments by brutality.&rdquo;&rsquo; Neither the <span class="t8">Annual Register</span> nor Miss Reynolds reports the Dean&rsquo;s speech. But she says that &lsquo;soon after the ladies withdrew, Dr. Johnson followed them, and sitting down by the lady of the house [that is by herself, if they were at Sir Joshua&rsquo;s] he said, &ldquo;I am very sorry for having spoken so rudely to the Dean.&rdquo; &ldquo;You very well may, Sir.&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it was highly improper to speak in that style to a minister of the gospel, and I am the more hurt on reflecting with what mild dignity he received it.&rdquo;&rsquo; If Johnson really spoke of the Dean&rsquo;s <span class="t8">mild dignity</span>, it is clear that Richard Burke&rsquo;s account is wrong. But it was written just after the scene, and Boswell says there was &lsquo;a pretty smart altercation.&rsquo; Miss Reynolds continues:&mdash; &lsquo;When the Dean came up into the drawing-room, Dr. Johnson immediately rose from his seat, and made him sit on the sofa by him, and with such a beseeching look for pardon and with such fond gestures &mdash; literally smoothing down his arms and his knees,&rsquo; &amp;c. The <span class="t8">Annual Register</span> says that Barnard the next day sent the verses addressed to &lsquo;Sir Joshua Reynolds &amp; Co.&rsquo; On the next page I give Richard Burke&rsquo;s version of the lines, and show the various readings.</p>

<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I lately thought no man alive</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could e&rsquo;er improve past forty-five,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And ventured to assert it;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The observation was not new,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But seem&rsquo;d to me so just and true,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That none could controvert it.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;No, Sir,&rsquo; says Johnson, &lsquo;&rsquo;tis not so;</p>
<p class="p24">&rsquo;Tis&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="t8">That&rsquo;s</span> your mistake, and I can show</p>

<p class="p24">You who perhaps are <span class="t8">You, Sir, who are near</span> forty-eight,</p>
<p class="p24">still&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; May <span class="t8">much</span> improve, &rsquo;tis not too late;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish you&rsquo;d set about it.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Encouraged thus to mend my faults,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I turn&rsquo;d his counsel in my thoughts,</p>
<p class="p24">could&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which way I <span class="t8">should</span> apply it:</p>

<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then come, my friends, and try your skill,</p>
<p class="p24">may&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You <span class="t8">can improve me, if you will;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; inform</span></p>

<p class="p24"><span class="t8">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of books I shall read men,</span></p>

<p class="p24">Horace Walpole, on Dec. 27, 1775, speaks of these verses as if they were fresh. &lsquo;They are an answer,&rsquo; he writes, &lsquo;to a gross brutality of Dr. Johnson, to which a properer answer would have been to fling a glass of wine in his face. I have no patience with an unfortunate monster trusting to his helpless deformity for indemnity for any impertinence that his arrogance suggests, and who thinks that what he has read is an excuse for everything he says.&rsquo; Horace Walpole&rsquo;s Letters, <span class="t8">vi. 302. It is strange that Walpole should be so utterly ignorant of Johnson&rsquo;s courage and bodily strength. The date of Walpole&rsquo;s letter makes me suspect that Richard Burke dated his Jan. 6, 1775 (he should have written 1776), and that the blunder of a copyist has changed 1775 into 1773.</span></p>

<p class="p24">(Page <span class="t8">238.)</span></p>
<p class="p24">Had Boswell continued the quotation from Priestley&rsquo;s Illustrations of Philosophical Necessity <span class="t8">he would have shown that though Priestley could not</span> hate <span class="t8">the rioters, he could very easily</span> prosecute <span class="t8">them. He says: &mdash; </span></p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;If as a Necessarian I cease to blame <span class="t8">men for their vices in the ultimate sense of the word, though, in the common and proper sense of it, I continue to do as much as other persons (for how necessarily soever they act, they are influenced by a base and mischievous disposition of mind, against which I must guard myself and others in proportion as I love myself and others),&rsquo; &amp;c. Priestley&rsquo;s</span> Works<span class="t8">, iii. 508.</span></p>
<p class="p24">Of his interview with Johnson, Priestley, in his Appeal to the Public<span class="t8">, part ii, published in 1792 (</span>Works<span class="t8">, xix. 502), thus writes, answering &lsquo;the impudent falsehood that when I was at Oxford Dr. Johnson left a company on my being introduced to it&rsquo;: &mdash; </span></p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;In fact we never were at Oxford at the same time, and the only interview I ever had with him was at Mr. Paradise&rsquo;s, where we dined together at his own request. He was particularly civil to me, and promised to call upon me the next time he should go through Birmingham. He behaved with the same civility to Dr. Price, when they supped together at Dr. Adams&rsquo;s at Oxford. Several circumstances show that Dr. Johnson had not so much of bigotry at the decline of life as had distinguished him before, on which account it is well known to all our common acquaintance, that I declined all their pressing solicitations to be introduced to him.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Priestley expresses himself ill, but his meaning can be made out. Parr answered Boswell in the March number of the Gent. Mag. <span class="t8">for 1795, p. 179. But the evidence that he brings is rendered needless by Priestley&rsquo;s positive statement. May peace henceforth fall on &lsquo;Priestley&rsquo;s injured name.&rsquo; (Mrs. Barbauld&rsquo;s</span> Poems<span class="t8">, ii. 243.)</span></p>
<p class="p24">When Boswell asserts that Johnson &lsquo;was particularly resolute in not giving countenance to men whose writings he considered as pernicious to society,&rsquo; he forgets that that very summer of 1783 he had been willing to dine at Wilkes&rsquo;s house (ante<span class="t8">, p. 224, note 2).</span></p>
<p class="p24">Dr. Franklin (Memoirs<span class="t8">, ed. 1833, iii. 157) wrote to Dr. Price in 1784:&mdash; &lsquo;It is said that scarce anybody but yourself and Dr. Priestley possesses the art of knowing how to differ decently.&rsquo; Gibbon (</span>Misc. Works<span class="t8">, i. 304), describing in 1789 the honestest members of the French Assembly, calls them &lsquo;a set of wild visionaries, like our Dr. Price, who gravely debate, and dream about the establishment of a pure and perfect democracy of five and twenty millions, the virtues of the golden age, and the primitive rights and equality of mankind.&rsquo; Admiration of Price made Samuel Rogers, when a boy, wish to be a preacher. &lsquo;I thought there was nothing on earth so</span> grand <span class="t8">as to figure in a pulpit. Dr. Price lived much in the society of Lord Lansdowne [Earl of Shelburne] and other people of rank; and his manners were extremely polished. In the pulpit he was great indeed.&rsquo; Rogers&rsquo;s</span> Table Talk<span class="t8">, p. 3.</span></p>
<p class="p24">The full title of the tract mentioned by Boswell is, A small Whole-Length of Dr. Priestley from his Printed Works<span class="t8">. It was published in 1792, and is a very poor piece of writing.</span></p>
<p class="p24">Johnson had refused to meet the Abbé Raynal, the author of the Histoire Philosophique et Politique du Commerce des Deux Indes<span class="t8">, when he was over in England in 1777. Mrs. Chapone, writing to Mrs. Carter on June 15 of that year, says: &mdash; </span></p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I suppose you have heard a great deal of the Abbé Raynal, who is in London. I fancy you would have served him as Dr. Johnson did, to whom when Mrs. Vesey introduced him, he turned from him, and said he had read his book, and would have nothing to say to him.&rsquo; Mrs. Chapone&rsquo;s Posthumous Works<span class="t8">, i. 172.</span></p>
<p class="p24">See Walpole&rsquo;s Letters<span class="t8">, v. 421, and vi. 444. His book was burnt by the common hangman in Paris. Carlyle&rsquo;s</span> French Revolution<span class="t8">, ed. 1857, i. 45.</span></p>

<p class="p24">Hawkins gives the two following notes: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;As Mr. Ryland was talking with me of old friends and past times, we warmed ourselves into a wish, that all who remained of the club should meet and dine at the house which once was Horseman&rsquo;s, in Ivy-lane. I have undertaken to solicit you, and therefore desire you to tell on what day next week you can conveniently meet your old friends.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am, Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your most humble servant,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Bolt-court, Nov. 22, 1783.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;In perambulating Ivy-lane, Mr. Ryland found neither our landlord Horseman, nor his successor. The old house is shut up, and he liked not the appearance of any near it; he therefore bespoke our dinner at the Queen&rsquo;s Arms, in St. Paul&rsquo;s Church-yard, where, at half an hour after three, your company will be desired to-day by those who remain of our former society.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your humble servant,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Dec. 3.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Four met &mdash; Johnson, Hawkins, Ryland, and Payne (ante<span class="t8">, i. 243).</span></p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;We dined,&rsquo; Hawkins continues, &lsquo;and in the evening regaled with coffee. At ten we broke up, much to the regret of Johnson, who proposed staying; but finding us inclined to separate, he left us with a sigh that seemed to come from his heart, lamenting that he was retiring to solitude and cheerless meditation.&rsquo; Hawkins&rsquo;s Johnson<span class="t8">, p. 562.</span></p>
<p class="p24">Hawkins is mistaken in saying that they had a second meeting at a tavern at the end of a month; for Johnson, on March 10, 1784, wrote: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I have been confined from the fourteenth of December, and know not when I shall get out.&rsquo; Piozzi Letters<span class="t8">, ii. 351.</span></p>
<p class="p24">He thus describes these meetings: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Dec. 13. I dined about a fortnight ago with three old friends; we had not met together for thirty years, and one of us thought the other grown very old. In the thirty years two of our set have died; our meeting may be supposed to be somewhat tender.&rsquo; Piozzi Letters<span class="t8">, ii. 339.</span></p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Jan. 12, 1784. I had the same old friends to dine with me on Wednesday, and may say that since I lost sight of you I have had one pleasant day.&rsquo; Ib. p. 346.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;April 15, 1784. Yesterday I had the pleasure of giving another dinner to the remainder of the old club. We used to meet weekly, about the year fifty, and we were as cheerful as in former times; only I could not make quite so much noise, for since the paralytick affliction my voice is sometimes weak.&rsquo; Ib. p. 361.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;April 19, 1784. The people whom I mentioned in my letter are the remnant of a little club that used to meet in Ivy-lane about three and thirty years ago, out of which we have lost Hawkesworth and Dyer; the rest are yet on this side the grave. Our meetings now are serious, and I think on all parts tender.&rsquo; Ib. 363.</p>

<p class="p24">It is likely that Sir Joshua Reynolds refused to join the Essex Head Club because he did not wish to meet Barry. Not long before this time he had censured Barry&rsquo;s delay in entering upon his duties as Professor of painting.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Barry answered:&mdash; &ldquo;If I had no more to do in the composition of my lectures than to produce such poor flimsy stuff as your discourses, I should soon have done my work, and be prepared to read.&rdquo; It is said this speech was delivered with his fist clenched, in a menacing posture.&rsquo; (Northcote&rsquo;s Life of Reynolds<span class="t8">, ii. 146.)</span></p>

<p class="p24">&lsquo;I was not made privy to this his intention, but all circumstances considered, it was no matter of surprise to me when I heard that the great Dr. Johnson had, in the month of December 1783, formed a sixpenny club at an ale-house in Essex-street, and that though some of the persons thereof were persons of note, strangers, under restrictions, for three pence each night might three nights in a week hear him talk and partake of his conversation.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Miss Hawkins (Memoirs<span class="t8">, i. 103) says: &mdash; </span></p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Boswell was well justified in his resentment of my father&rsquo;s designation of this club as a sixpenny club, meeting at an ale-house. ... Honestly speaking, I dare say my father did not like being passed over.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Sir Joshua Reynolds, writing of the club, says: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Any company was better than none; by which Johnson connected himself with many mean persons whose presence he could command. For this purpose he established a club at a little ale-house in Essex-street, composed of a strange mixture of very learned and very ingenious odd people. Of the former were Dr. Heberden, Mr. Windham, Mr. Boswell, Mr. Steevens, Mr. Paradise. Those of the latter I do not think proper to enumerate.&rsquo; Taylor&rsquo;s Life of Reynolds<span class="t8">, ii. 455.</span></p>
<p class="p24">It is possible that Reynolds had never seen the Essex Head, and that the term &lsquo;little ale-house&rsquo; he had borrowed from Hawkins&rsquo;s account. Possibly too his disgust at Barry here found vent. Murphy (Life of Johnson<span class="t8">, p. 124) says: &mdash; </span></p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The members of the club were respectable for their rank, their talents, and their literature.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">The &lsquo;little ale-house&rsquo; club saw one of its members, Alderman Clarke (ante<span class="t8">, p. 258), Lord Mayor within a year; another, Horsley, a Bishop within five years; and a third, Windham, Secretary at War within ten years.

<p class="p24">&lsquo;Dec. 10. At night my father brought us the most dismal tidings of dear Dr. Johnson. He had thanked and taken leave of all his physicians. Alas! I shall lose him, and he will take no leave of me. My father was deeply depressed. I hear from everyone he is now perfectly resigned to his approaching fate, and no longer in terror of death.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Dec. 11. My father in the morning saw this first of men. He was up and very composed. He took his hand very kindly, asked after all his family, and then in particular how Fanny did. &ldquo;I hope,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;Fanny did not take it amiss that I did not see her. I was very bad. Tell Fanny to pray for me.&rdquo; After which, still grasping his hand, he made a prayer for himself, the most fervent, pious, humble, eloquent, and touching, my father says, that ever was composed. Oh! would I had heard it! He ended it with Amen! in which my father joined, and was echoed by all present; and again, when my father was leaving him, he brightened up, something of his arch look returned, and he said: &ldquo;I think I shall throw the ball at Fanny yet.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Dec. 12. [Miss Burney called at Bolt-court.] All the rest went away but a Mrs. Davis, a good sort of woman, whom this truly charitable soul had sent for to take a dinner at his house. [See ante<span class="t8">, p. 239, note 2.] Mr. Langton then came. He could not look at me, and I turned away from him. Mrs. Davis asked how the Doctor was. &ldquo;Going on to death very fast,&rdquo; was his mournful answer. &ldquo;Has he taken,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;anything?&rdquo; &ldquo;Nothing at all. We carried him some bread and milk &mdash; he refused it, and said:&mdash; &lsquo;The less the better.&rsquo;&rdquo;&rsquo;</span></p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Dec. 20. This day was the ever-honoured, ever-lamented Dr. Johnson committed to the earth. Oh, how sad a day to me! My father attended.

<p class="p24">Boswell most likely never knew that in the year 1790 Mr. Seward, in the name of Cadell the publisher, had asked Parr to write a Life of Johnson<span class="t8">. (Johnstone&rsquo;s</span> Life of Parr<span class="t8">, iv. 678.) Parr, in his amusing vanity, was as proud of this</span> Life <span class="t8">as if he had written it. &lsquo;&ldquo;It would have been,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the third most learned work that has ever yet appeared. The most learned work ever published I consider Bentley</span> On the Epistles of Phalaris<span class="t8">; the next Salmasius</span> On the Hellenistic Language<span class="t8">.&rdquo; Alluding to Boswell&rsquo;s Life he continued, &ldquo;Mine should have been, not the droppings of his lips, but the history of his mind.&rdquo;&rsquo; Field&rsquo;s</span> Life of Parr<span class="t8">, i. 164.</span></p>
<p class="p24">In the epitaph that he first sent in were found the words &lsquo;Probabili Poetae.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;In arms,&rsquo; wrote Parr, &lsquo;were all the Johnsonians: Malone, Steevens, Sir W. Scott, Windham, and even Fox, all in arms. The epithet was cold. They do not understand it, and I am a Scholar, not a Belles-Lettres man.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Parr had wished to pass over all notice of Johnson&rsquo;s poetical character. To this, Malone said, none of his friends of the Literary Club would agree. He pointed out also that Parr had not noticed &lsquo;that part of Johnson&rsquo;s genius, which placed him on higher ground than perhaps any other quality that can be named &mdash; the universality of his knowledge, the promptness of his mind in producing it on all occasions in conversation, and the vivid eloquence with which he clothed his thoughts, however suddenly called upon.&rsquo; Parr, regardless of Johnson&rsquo;s rule that &lsquo;in lapidary inscriptions a man is not upon oath&rsquo; (ante<span class="t8">, ii. 407), replied, that if he mentioned his conversation he should have to mention also his roughness in contradiction, &amp;c. As for the epithet</span> probabili<span class="t8">, he &lsquo;never reflected upon it without almost a triumphant feeling in its felicity.&rsquo; Nevertheless he would change it into &lsquo;poetae sententiarum et verborum ponderibus admirabili.&rsquo; Yet these words, &lsquo;energetic and sonorous&rsquo; though they were, &lsquo;fill one with a secret and invincible loathing, because they tend to introduce into the epitaph a character of magnificence.&rsquo; With every fresh objection he rose in importance. He wrote for the approbation of real scholars of generations yet unborn. &lsquo;That the epitaph was written by such or such a man will, from the publicity of the situation, and the popularity of the subject, be long remembered.&rsquo; Johnstone&rsquo;s</span> Life of Parr<span class="t8">, iv. 694-712. No objection seems to have been raised to the five pompous lines of perplexing dates and numerals in which no room is found even for Johnson&rsquo;s birth and birth-place.</span></p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;After I had written the epitaph,&rsquo; wrote Parr to a friend, &lsquo;Sir Joshua Reynolds told me there was a scroll. I was in a rage. A scroll! Why, Ned, this is vile modern contrivance. I wanted one train of ideas. What could I do with the scroll? Johnson held it, and Johnson must speak in it. I thought of this, his favourite maxim, in the Life of Milton, [Johnson&rsquo;s Works<span class="t8">, vii. 77],</span></p>

<p class="p24">I adopted it, and gave Seward the praise. &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; quoth Sir William Scott, &ldquo;[Greek: makaron] <span class="t8">is Heathenish, and the Dean and Chapter will hesitate.&rdquo; &ldquo;The more fools they,&rdquo; said I. But to prevent disputes I have altered it.</span></p>

<p class="p24">Though the inscription on the scroll is not strictly speaking part of the epitaph, yet this mixture of Greek and Latin is open to the censure Johnson passed on Pope&rsquo;s Epitaph on Craggs.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;It may be proper to remark,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;the absurdity of joining in the same inscription Latin and English, or verse and prose. If either language be preferable to the other, let that only be used; for no reason can be given why part of the information should be given in one tongue and part in another on a tomb more than in any other place, or on any other occasion.&rsquo; Johnson&rsquo;s Works<span class="t8">, viii. 353.</span></p>
