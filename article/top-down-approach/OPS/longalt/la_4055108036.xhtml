In the Internal Network we see (from left to right): three computers connected to a switch, which connects to an IDS sensor (which looks here like a small answering machine), which connects to a router, which connects to a second switch and is itself connected to a computer and a server, which connects to a second IDS sensor, and which is connected to an Application Gateway (which looks here like a larger answering machine). The gateway application connects to a server outside of the network, which connects to the right to a Filter (which looks here like an even larger answering machine). To the right of the filter is a firewall, and beyond the firewall is the Internet.</p><p id="P700101195200000000000000000B99D" data-uri="M08_KURO4140_07_SE_C08.xhtml#P700101195200000000000000000B99D">The router outside of the network also connects downward to an IDS sensor, which connects to a switch in the Demilitarized Zone. The switch connects to three servers: Web server, FTP server, and DNS server.</p></div></section></body></html>
