<p class="p21">It is possible that there are still people in England who do not adore Dr. Johnson.&nbsp; These persons must be removed, if possible, by persuasion. A short and plain attempt to persuade them must take precedence of subtler questions in every discussion of the great man. Now this old and superficial misunderstanding of Johnson (now nearly extinct) expresses itself in two main popular notions &mdash; that he was pedantic and that he was rude.&nbsp; He occasionally was rude; he never was pedantic.&nbsp; He was probably the most unpedantic man that ever lived; certainly you and I are much more pedantic than Dr. Johnson.&nbsp; For pedantry means the worship of dead words; and his words, whether long or short, were always alive. He played long words and short words against each other with impromptu but infallible art.&nbsp; I am far from books, and I quote from memory, but I think that a Scotchman, vexed at the ritual jeers of Johnson against his country, said:&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you remember that God made Scotland?&rdquo; Johnson replied promptly:&nbsp; &ldquo;Sir, you are to remember that he made it for Scotchmen.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then, after a pause, he said in grave meditation: &ldquo;Comparisons are odious; but God made hell.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now the vague popular opinion of Johnson would concentrate on long words like &ldquo;comparisons&rdquo; and &ldquo;odious&rdquo;, and retain the impression that he was pedantic. It would be just as easy to concentrate on words like &ldquo;hell&rdquo; and give the impression that he was vulgar.&nbsp; The only true way of testing the matter is to look at the whole sentence and ask oneself if there is a single word, long or short, out of its place. Johnson was the reverse of pedantic, for he used long words only where they would be effective.&nbsp; Generally it came to this, that he spoke pompously when Boswell spoke flippantly and flippantly when Boswell spoke pompously &mdash; a very sound rule.&nbsp; When Boswell confronted him with the brute facts of a lonely tower and a baby, he answered, with distant dignity:&nbsp; &ldquo;Sir, I should not much like my company.&rdquo; But when Boswell justified some morally backsliding bishop or vicar with that elaborate hash of sophistry and charity which is still used to excuse the rich, Johnson answered him with a few short words, so full of Christianity and common sense that I should not be allowed to print them.</p>
<p class="p24">The charge of rudeness is much more real; but about this also an impression still surviving requires a great deal of correction. Taken in conjunction with the charge of pedantry, it has created the image of a bullying schoolmaster, a superior person who thinks himself above good manners.&nbsp; Now Johnson was sometimes insolent, but he was never superior.&nbsp; He was not a despot, but exactly the reverse.&nbsp; It was his sense of the democracy of debate that made him loud and unscrupulous, like a mob.&nbsp; It was exactly because he thought the other men as clever as himself that he sought in desperate cases to bear them down by clamour.&nbsp; Everyone knows the brilliant description of him by one of his best friends: &ldquo;If his pistol misses fire he knocks you down with the butt of it.&rdquo; But few realise that this is the act of a simple and heroic fellow fighting against a superior force.&nbsp; Johnson was a man of great animal impulsiveness and of irregular temper, but intellectually he was humble. He always went into every conflict with the idea that the other man was as good as he was, and that he might be defeated.&nbsp; His bellowings and bangings of the table were the expressions of a fundamental modesty. We can feel this element, I think, in everything he said, down to those last awful words upon his death-bed, when he spoke of Burke, the one man who had really excited and arrested him, &ldquo;If I saw him now it would kill me.&rdquo;&nbsp; His fate in these respects has been strange. He has been called the pedant par excellence because he was the one thoroughly unpedantic person of a pedantic age. He has been called a conversational tyrant, because he was the one man of his mental rank who was ready to argue with his inferiors. On the one hand it is often said that he translated English into Johnsonese.&nbsp; But let it be remembered that he was the only man of his time who could translate Johnsonese back into English. Half a hundred critics in that age might have said of a play, &ldquo;It does not possess sufficient vitality to preserve it from putrefaction&rdquo;, but only Johnson could have said also, &ldquo;It has not wit enough to keep it sweet.&rdquo; There were numerous great men in the eighteenth century who kept a club or court of dependents, where they had things entirely their own way. I need not prove the point; the greatest satirist of that age has made the image immortal.</p>
<p class="p24">Like Cato gave his little Senate laws, And sat attentive to his own applause.</p>
<p class="p24">But Johnson was the reverse of attentive to people who were applauding him.&nbsp; Johnson was furiously deaf to people who were contradicting him.&nbsp; So far from being a stately and condescending king like Atticus, Johnson was a kind of Irish member in his own Parliament.&nbsp; All these are but broken and incidental examples; everything about the man rang of reality and honour; he never thought he was right without being ready to give battle; he never thought he was wrong without being ready to ask pardon.&nbsp; We have all heard enough to fill a book about Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s incivilities.&nbsp; I wish they would compile another book consisting of Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s apologies. There is no better test of a man&rsquo;s ultimate chivalry and integrity than how he behaves when he is wrong; and Johnson behaved very well. He understood (what so many faultlessly polite people do not understand) that a stiff apology is a second insult.&nbsp; He understood that the injured party does not want to be compensated because he has been wronged; he wants to be healed because he has been hurt. Boswell once complained to him in private, explaining that he did not mind asperities while they were alone, but did not like to be torn to pieces in company.&nbsp; He added some idle figure of speech, some simile so trivial that I cannot even remember what it was. &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said Johnson, &ldquo;that is one of the happiest similes I have ever heard.&rdquo;&nbsp; He did not waste time in formally withdrawing this word with reservations and that word with explanations. Finding that he had given pain, he went out of his way to give pleasure. If he had not known what would irritate Boswell, he knew at least what would soothe him.&nbsp; It is this gigantic realism in Johnson&rsquo;s kindness, the directness of his emotionalism, when he is emotional, that gives him his hold upon generations of living men. There is nothing elaborate about his ethics; he wants to know whether a man, as a fact, is happy or unhappy, is lying or telling the truth. He may seem to be hammering at the brain through long nights of noise and thunder, but he can walk into the heart without knocking.</p>
