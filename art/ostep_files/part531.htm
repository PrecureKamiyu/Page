NFS is centered around the idea of simple and fast recovery in the face of server failure, and achieves this end through careful protocol design. Idem- potency of operations is essential; because a client can safely replay a failed operation, it is OK to do so whether or not the server has executed the request.</p><p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">We also have seen how the introduction of caching into a multiple- client, single-server system can complicate things. In particular, the sys- tem must resolve the cache consistency problem in order to behave rea- sonably; however, NFS does so in a slightly ad hoc fashion which can occasionally result in observably weird behavior. Finally, we saw how server caching can be tricky: writes to the server must be forced to stable storage before returning success (otherwise data can be lost).</p><p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">We haven’t talked about other issues which are certainly relevant, no- tably security. Security in early NFS implementations was remarkably lax; it was rather easy for any user on a client to masquerade as other users and thus gain access to virtually any file. Subsequent integration with more serious authentication services (e.g., Kerberos [NT94]) have addressed these obvious deficiencies.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part530.htm">&lt; 上一个</a><span> | </span><a href="../ostep.html">内容</a><span> | </span><a href="part532.htm">下一个 &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
