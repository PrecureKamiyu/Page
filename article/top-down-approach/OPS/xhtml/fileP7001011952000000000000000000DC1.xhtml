In particular, the Netflix and YouTube services alone consumed a whopping 37% and 16%, respectively, of residential ISP traffic in 2015 <a class="biblioref" href="fileP70010119520000000000000000037E0.xhtml#P7001011952000000000000000003BE4" data-foobar="7">[Sandvine 2015]</a>. In this section we will provide an overview of how popular video streaming services are implemented in today’s Internet. We will see they are implemented using application-level protocols and servers that function in some ways like a cache.

<p id="P7001011952000000000000000009E16" data-uri="M02_KURO4140_07_SE_C02.xhtml#P7001011952000000000000000009E16">In streaming stored video applications, the underlying medium is prerecorded video, such as a movie, a television show, a prerecorded sporting event, or a prerecorded user-generated video (such as those commonly seen on YouTube). These prerecorded videos are placed on servers, and users send requests to the servers to view the videos <i>on demand</i>. Many Internet companies today provide streaming video, including, Netflix, YouTube (Google), Amazon, and Youku.</p>
<p id="P7001011952000000000000000009E17" data-uri="M02_KURO4140_07_SE_C02.xhtml#P7001011952000000000000000009E17">But before launching into a discussion of video streaming, we should first get a quick feel for the video medium itself. A video is a sequence of images, typically being displayed at a constant rate, for example, at 24 or 30 images per second. An uncompressed, digitally encoded image consists of an array of pixels, with each pixel encoded into a number of bits to represent luminance and color. An important characteristic of video is that it can be compressed, thereby trading off video quality with bit rate. Today’s off-the-shelf compression algorithms can compress a video to essentially any bit rate desired. Of course, the higher the bit rate, the better the image quality and the better the overall user viewing experience.</p>
<p id="P7001011952000000000000000009E18" data-uri="M02_KURO4140_07_SE_C02.xhtml#P7001011952000000000000000009E18">From a networking perspective, perhaps the most salient characteristic of video is its high bit rate. Compressed Internet video typically ranges from 100 kbps for low-quality video to over 3 Mbps for streaming high-definition movies; 4K streaming envisions a bitrate of more than 10 Mbps. This can translate to huge amount of traffic and storage, particularly for high-end video. For example, a single 2 Mbps <span class="pagebreak" title="148" id="P7001011952000000000000000000DC9" data-uri="M02_KURO4140_07_SE_C02.xhtml#P7001011952000000000000000000DC9" epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>video with a duration of 67 minutes will consume 1 gigabyte of storage and traffic. By far, the most important performance measure for streaming video is average end-to-end throughput. In order to provide continuous playout, the network must provide an average throughput to the streaming application that is at least as large as the bit rate of the compressed video.</p>
<p id="P7001011952000000000000000009E19" data-uri="M02_KURO4140_07_SE_C02.xhtml#P7001011952000000000000000009E19">We can also use compression to create multiple versions of the same video, each at a different quality level. For example, we can use compression to create, say, three versions of the same video, at rates of 300 kbps, 1 Mbps, and 3 Mbps. Users can then decide which version they want to watch as a function of their current available bandwidth. Users with high-speed Internet connections might choose the 3 Mbps version; users watching the video over 3G with a smartphone might choose the 300 kbps version.</p>

When a user wants to see the video, the client establishes a TCP connection with the server and issues an HTTP <code id="P7001011952000000000000000009E1C" data-uri="M02_KURO4140_07_SE_C02.xhtml#P7001011952000000000000000009E1C">GET</code> request for that URL. The server then sends the video file, within an HTTP response message, as quickly as the underlying network protocols and traffic conditions will allow. On the client side, the bytes are collected in a client application buffer. Once the number of bytes in this buffer exceeds a predetermined threshold, the client application begins playback—specifically, the streaming video application periodically grabs video frames from the client application buffer, decompresses the frames, and displays them on the user’s screen. Thus, the video streaming application is displaying video as it is receiving and buffering frames corresponding to latter parts of the video.</p>
<p id="P7001011952000000000000000009E1D" data-uri="M02_KURO4140_07_SE_C02.xhtml#P7001011952000000000000000009E1D">Although HTTP streaming, as described in the previous paragraph, has been extensively deployed in practice (for example, by YouTube since its inception), it has a major shortcoming: All clients receive the same encoding of the video, despite the large variations in the amount of bandwidth available to a client, both across different clients and also over time for the same client. This has led to the development of a new type of HTTP-based streaming, often referred to as <span class="keyword" id="P7001011952000000000000000000DD0" data-uri="M02_KURO4140_07_SE_C02.xhtml#P7001011952000000000000000000DD0">Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH)</span>. In DASH, the video is encoded into several different versions, with each version having a different bit rate and, correspondingly, a different quality level. The client dynamically requests chunks of video segments of a few seconds in length. When the amount of available bandwidth is high, the client naturally selects chunks from a high-rate version; and when the available bandwidth is low, it naturally selects from a low-rate version. The client selects different chunks one at a time with HTTP GET request messages <a class="biblioref" href="fileP70010119520000000000000000037E0.xhtml#P70010119520000000000000000037FF" data-foobar="7">[Akhshabi 2011]</a>.</p>

Clients with low-speed 3G connections can receive a low bit-rate (and low-quality) version, and clients with fiber connections can receive a high-quality version. DASH also allows a client to adapt to the available bandwidth if the available end-to-end bandwidth changes during the session. This feature is <span class="pagebreak" title="149" id="P7001011952000000000000000000DD2" data-uri="M02_KURO4140_07_SE_C02.xhtml#P7001011952000000000000000000DD2" epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>particularly important for mobile users, who typically see their bandwidth availability fluctuate as they move with respect to the base stations.</p>
<p id="P7001011952000000000000000009E1F" data-uri="M02_KURO4140_07_SE_C02.xhtml#P7001011952000000000000000009E1F">With DASH, each video version is stored in the HTTP server, each with a different URL. The HTTP server also has a <span class="keyword" id="P7001011952000000000000000000DD4" data-uri="M02_KURO4140_07_SE_C02.xhtml#P7001011952000000000000000000DD4"><b>manifest file</b></span>, which provides a URL for each version along with its bit rate. The client first requests the manifest file and learns about the various versions. The client then selects one chunk at a time by specifying a URL and a byte range in an HTTP GET request message for each chunk. While downloading chunks, the client also measures the received bandwidth and runs a rate determination algorithm to select the chunk to request next. Naturally, if the client has a lot of video buffered and if the measured receive bandwidth is high, it will choose a chunk from a high-bitrate version. And naturally if the client has little video buffered and the measured received bandwidth is low, it will choose a chunk from a low-bitrate version. DASH therefore allows the client to freely switch among different quality levels.</p>

YouTube, for example, with a library of hundreds of millions of videos, distributes hundreds of millions of video streams to users around the world every day. Streaming all this traffic to locations all over the world while providing continuous playout and high interactivity is clearly a challenging task.</p>
<p id="P7001011952000000000000000009E22" data-uri="M02_KURO4140_07_SE_C02.xhtml#P7001011952000000000000000009E22">For an Internet video company, perhaps the most straightforward approach to providing streaming video service is to build a single massive data center, store all of its videos in the data center, and stream the videos directly from the data center to clients worldwide. But there are three major problems with this approach. First, if the client is far from the data center, server-to-client packets will cross many communication links and likely pass through many ISPs, with some of the ISPs possibly located on different continents. If one of these links provides a throughput that is less than the video consumption rate, the end-to-end throughput will also be below the consumption rate, resulting in annoying freezing delays for the user. (Recall from <a class="xref" href="fileP7001011952000000000000000000458.xhtml#P7001011952000000000000000000458" data-foobar="7"><span class="label">Chapter</span> <span class="number">1</span></a> that the end-to-end throughput of a stream is governed by the throughput at the bottleneck link.) The likelihood of this happening increases as the number of links in the end-to-end path increases. A second drawback is that a popular video will likely be sent many times over the same communication links. Not only does this waste network bandwidth, but the Internet video company itself will be paying its provider ISP (connected to the data center) for sending the <i>same</i> bytes into the Internet over and over again. A third problem with this solution is that a single data center represents a single point of failure—if the data center or its links to the Internet goes down, it would not be able to distribute <i>any</i> video streams.</p>

(Access networks are described in <a class="xref" href="fileP7001011952000000000000000000542.xhtml#P7001011952000000000000000000542" data-foobar="7"><span class="label">Section</span> <span class="number">1.3</span></a>.) Akamai takes this approach with clusters in approximately 1,700 locations. The goal is to get close to end users, thereby improving user-perceived delay and throughput by decreasing the number of links and routers between the end user and the CDN server from which it receives content. Because of this highly distributed design, the task of maintaining and managing the clusters becomes challenging.</p></li>
<li id="P7001011952000000000000000009E28" data-uri="M02_KURO4140_07_SE_C02.xhtml#P7001011952000000000000000009E28"><p id="P7001011952000000000000000009E29" data-uri="M02_KURO4140_07_SE_C02.xhtml#P7001011952000000000000000009E29"><span class="leadin">Bring Home. </span>A second design philosophy, taken by Limelight and many other CDN companies, is to <i>bring the ISPs home</i> by building large clusters at a smaller number (for example, tens) of sites. Instead of getting inside the access ISPs, these CDNs typically place their clusters in Internet Exchange Points (IXPs) (see <a class="xref" href="fileP7001011952000000000000000000542.xhtml#P7001011952000000000000000000542" data-foobar="7"><span class="label">Section</span> <span class="number">1.3</span></a>). Compared with the enter-deep design philosophy, the bring-home design typically results in lower maintenance and management overhead, possibly at the expense of higher delay and lower throughput to end users.</p></li>

The CDN may not want to place a copy of every video in each cluster, since some videos are rarely viewed or are only popular in some countries. In fact, many CDNs do not push videos to their clusters but instead use a simple pull strategy: If a client requests a video from a cluster that is not storing the video, then the cluster retrieves the video (from a central repository or from another cluster) and stores a copy locally while streaming the video to the client at the same time. Similar Web caching (see <a class="xref" href="fileP7001011952000000000000000000A27.xhtml#P7001011952000000000000000000B3B" data-foobar="7"><span class="label">Section</span> <span class="number">2.2.5</span></a>), when a cluster’s storage becomes full, it removes videos that are not frequently requested.</p>

When a user makes a search query, often the query is first sent over the local ISP to a nearby enter-deep cache, from where the static content is retrieved; while providing the static content to the client, the nearby cache also forwards the query over Google’s private network to one of the mega data centers, from where the personalized search results are retrieved. For a YouTube video, the video itself may come from one of the bring-home caches, whereas portions of the Web page surrounding the video may come from the nearby enter-deep cache, and the advertisements surrounding the video come from the data centers. In summary, except for the local ISPs, the Google cloud services are largely provided by a network infrastructure that is independent of the public Internet.</p>

As we just saw, the CDN learns the IP address of the client’s LDNS server via the client’s DNS lookup. After learning this IP address, the CDN needs to select an appropriate cluster based on this IP address. CDNs generally employ proprietary cluster selection strategies. We now briefly survey a few approaches, each of which has its own advantages and disadvantages.</p>

Using commercial geo-location databases (such as Quova <a class="biblioref" href="fileP70010119520000000000000000037E0.xhtml#P7001011952000000000000000003AC6" data-foobar="7">[Quova 2016]</a> and Max-Mind <a class="biblioref" href="fileP70010119520000000000000000037E0.xhtml#P7001011952000000000000000003A3F" data-foobar="7">[MaxMind 2016]</a>), each LDNS IP address is mapped to a geographic location. When a DNS request is received from a particular LDNS, the CDN chooses the geographically closest cluster, that is, the cluster that is the fewest kilometers from the LDNS “as the bird flies.” Such a solution can work reasonably well for a large fraction of the clients <a class="biblioref" href="fileP70010119520000000000000000037E0.xhtml#P70010119520000000000000000037F4" data-foobar="7">[Agarwal 2009]</a>. However, for some clients, the solution may perform poorly, since the geographically closest cluster may not be the closest cluster in terms of the length or number of hops of the network path. Furthermore, a problem inherent with all DNS-based approaches is that some end-users are configured to use remotely located LDNSs <a class="biblioref" href="fileP70010119520000000000000000037E0.xhtml#P7001011952000000000000000003C0B" data-foobar="7">[Shaikh 2001</a>; Mao 2002], in which case the LDNS location may be far from the client’s location. Moreover, this simple strategy ignores the variation in delay and available bandwidth over time of Internet paths, always assigning the same cluster to a particular client.</p>

For instance, a CDN can have each of its clusters periodically send probes (for example, ping messages or DNS queries) to all of the LDNSs around the world. One drawback of this approach is that many LDNSs are configured to not respond to such probes.</p>

Netflix has since created its own private CDN, from which it now streams all of its videos. (Netflix still uses Akamai to distribute its Web pages, however.) To create its own CDN, Netflix has installed server racks both in IXPs and within residential ISPs themselves. Netflix currently has server racks in over 50 IXP locations; see <a class="biblioref" href="fileP70010119520000000000000000037E0.xhtml#P7001011952000000000000000003A6B" data-foobar="7">[Netflix Open Connect 2016]</a> for a current list of IXPs housing Netflix racks. There are also hundreds of ISP locations housing Netflix racks; also see <a class="biblioref" href="fileP70010119520000000000000000037E0.xhtml#P7001011952000000000000000003A6B" data-foobar="7">[Netflix Open Connect 2016]</a>, where Netflix provides to potential ISP partners instructions about installing a (free) Netflix rack for their networks. Each server in the rack has several 10 Gbps Ethernet ports and over 100 terabytes of storage. The number of servers in a rack varies: IXP installations often have tens of servers and contain the entire Netflix streaming video library, including multiple versions of the videos to support DASH; local IXPs may only have one server and contain only the most popular videos. Netflix does not use pull-caching (<a class="xref" href="fileP7001011952000000000000000000A27.xhtml#P7001011952000000000000000000B3B" data-foobar="7"><span class="label">Section</span> <span class="number">2.2.5</span></a>) to populate its CDN servers in the IXPs and ISPs. Instead, Netflix distributes by pushing the videos to its CDN servers during off-peak hours. For those locations that cannot hold the entire library, Netflix pushes only the most popular videos, which are determined on a day-to-day basis. The Netflix CDN design is described in some detail in the YouTube videos <a class="biblioref" href="fileP70010119520000000000000000037E0.xhtml#P7001011952000000000000000003A6D" data-foobar="7">[Netflix Video 1]</a> and <a class="biblioref" href="fileP70010119520000000000000000037E0.xhtml#P7001011952000000000000000003A6F" data-foobar="7">[Netflix Video 2]</a>.</p>

As indicated earlier, the Web pages for browsing the Netflix video library are served from servers in the Amazon cloud. When a user selects a movie to play, the Netflix software, running in the Amazon cloud, first determines which of its CDN servers have copies of the movie. Among the servers that have the movie, the software then determines the “best” server for that client request. If the client is using a residential ISP that has a Netflix CDN server rack installed in that ISP, and this rack has a copy of the requested movie, then a server in this rack is typically selected. If not, a server at a nearby IXP is typically selected.</p>
<p id="P7001011952000000000000000009E67" data-uri="M02_KURO4140_07_SE_C02.xhtml#P7001011952000000000000000009E67">Once Netflix determines the CDN server that is to deliver the content, it sends the client the IP address of the specific server as well as a manifest file, which has the URLs for the different versions of the requested movie. The client and that CDN server then directly interact using a proprietary version of DASH. Specifically, as described in <a class="xref" href="#P7001011952000000000000000000DCB" data-foobar="1"><span class="label">Section</span> <span class="number">2.6.2</span></a>, the client uses the byte-range header in HTTP GET request messages, to request chunks from the different versions of the movie. Netflix uses chunks that are approximately four-seconds long <a class="biblioref" href="fileP70010119520000000000000000037E0.xhtml#P70010119520000000000000000037F0" data-foobar="7">[Adhikari 2012]</a>. While the chunks are being downloaded, the client measures the received throughput and runs a rate-determination algorithm to determine the quality of the next chunk to request.</p>

However, because Netflix uses its own private CDN, which distributes only video (and not Web pages), Netflix has been able to simplify and tailor its CDN design.

Furthermore, the Netflix CDN uses push caching rather than pull caching (<a class="xref" href="fileP7001011952000000000000000000A27.xhtml#P7001011952000000000000000000B3B" data-foobar="7"><span class="label">Section</span> <span class="number">2.2.5</span></a>): content is pushed into the servers at scheduled times at off-peak hours, rather than dynamically during cache misses.</p>

YouTube does not employ adaptive streaming (such as DASH), but instead requires the user to manually select a version.

As you might suspect, this approach uses P2P delivery instead of (or along with) client-server delivery. Since 2011, Kankan (owned and operated by Xunlei) has been deploying P2P video delivery with great success, with tens of millions of users every month <a class="biblioref" href="fileP70010119520000000000000000037E0.xhtml#P7001011952000000000000000003CA0" data-foobar="7">[Zhang 2015]</a>.</p>

When a peer wants to see a video, it contacts a tracker to discover other peers in the system that have a copy of that video. This requesting peer then requests chunks of the video in parallel from the other peers that have the video. Different from downloading with BitTorrent, however, requests are preferentially made for chunks that are to be played back in the near future in order to ensure continuous playback <a class="biblioref" href="fileP70010119520000000000000000037E0.xhtml#P70010119520000000000000000038C4" data-foobar="7">[Dhungel 2012]</a>.</p>

Specifically, Kankan now deploys a few hundred servers within China and pushes video content to these servers. This Kankan CDN plays a major role in the start-up stage of video streaming. In most cases, the client requests the beginning of the content from CDN servers, and in parallel requests content from peers. When the total P2P traffic is sufficient for video playback, the client will cease streaming from the CDN and only stream from peers. But if the P2P streaming traffic becomes insufficient, the client will restart CDN connections and return to the mode of hybrid CDN-P2P streaming. In this manner, Kankan can ensure short initial start-up delays while minimally relying on costly infrastructure servers and bandwidth.</p>
