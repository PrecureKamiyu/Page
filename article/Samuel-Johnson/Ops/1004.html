<p class="p24">&lsquo;Mr. Boswell has this day shewn me a letter, in which you complain of a passage in <span class="t8">The Journey to the Hebrides.</span> My meaning is mistaken. I did not intend to say that you had personally made any cession of the rights of your house, or any acknowledgement of the superiority of M&rsquo;Leod of Dunvegan. I only designed to express what I thought generally admitted, &mdash; that the house of Rasay allowed the superiority of the house of Dunvegan. Even this I now find to be erroneous, and will therefore omit or retract it in the next edition.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Though what I had said had been true, if it had been disagreeable to you, I should have wished it unsaid; for it is not my business to adjust precedence. As it is mistaken, I find myself disposed to correct, both by my respect for you, and my reverence for truth. &lsquo;As I know not when the book will be reprinted, I have desired Mr. Boswell to anticipate the correction in the Edinburgh papers. This is all that can be done.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I hope I may now venture to desire that my compliments may be made, and my gratitude expressed, to Lady Rasay, Mr. Malcolm M&rsquo;Leod, Mr. Donald M&rsquo;Queen, and all the gentlemen and all the ladies whom I saw in the island of Rasay; a place which I remember with too much pleasure and too much kindness, not to be sorry that my ignorance, or hasty persuasion, should, for a single moment, have violated its tranquillity.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I beg you all to forgive an undesigned and involuntary injury, and to consider me as,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Sir, your most obliged,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;And most humble servant,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;London, May 6, 1775.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">It would be improper for me to boast of my own labours; but I cannot refrain from publishing such praise as I received from such a man as Sir William Forbes, of Pitsligo, after the perusal of the original manuscript of my <span class="t8">Journal</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To JAMES BOSWELL, ESQ.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Edinburgh, March 7, 1777.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;My DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I ought to have thanked you sooner, for your very obliging letter, and for the singular confidence you are pleased to place in me, when you trust me with such a curious and valuable deposit as the papers you have sent me. Be assured I have a due sense of this favour, and shall faithfully and carefully return them to you. You may rely that I shall neither copy any part, nor permit the papers to be seen.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;They contain a curious picture of society, and form a journal on the most instructive plan that can possibly be thought of; for I am not sure that an ordinary observer would become so well acquainted either with Dr. Johnson, or with the manners of the Hebrides, by a personal intercourse, as by a perusal of your <span class="t8">Journal</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am, very truly,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Dear Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your most obedient,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;And affectionate humble servant,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;WILLIAM FORBES.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">When I consider how many of the persons mentioned in this Tour are now gone to &lsquo;that undiscovered country, from whose bourne no traveller returns,&rsquo; I feel an impression at once awful and tender. &mdash; <span class="t8">Requiescant in pace!</span></p>
<p class="p24">It may be objected by some persons, as it has been by one of my friends, that he who has the power of thus exhibiting an exact transcript of conversations is not a desirable member of society. I repeat the answer which I made to that friend:&mdash; &lsquo;Few, very few, need be afraid that their sayings will be recorded. Can it be imagined that I would take the trouble to gather what grows on every hedge, because I have collected such fruits as the <span class="t8">Nonpareil</span> and the BON CHRETIEN?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On the other hand, how useful is such a faculty, if well exercised! To it we owe all those interesting apophthegms and <span class="t8">memorabilia</span> of the ancients, which Plutarch, Xenophon, and Valerius Maximus, have transmitted to us. To it we owe all those instructive and entertaining collections which the French have made under the title of <span class="t8">Ana</span>, affixed to some celebrated name. To it we owe the <span class="t8">Table-Talk</span> of Selden, the <span class="t8">Conversation</span> between Ben Jonson and Drummond of Hawthornden, Spence&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Anecdotes</span> of Pope, and other valuable remains in our own language. How delighted should we have been, if thus introduced into the company of Shakspeare and of Dryden, of whom we know scarcely any thing but their admirable writings! What pleasure would it have given us, to have known their petty habits, their characteristick manners, their modes of composition, and their genuine opinion of preceding writers and of their contemporaries! All these are now irrecoverably lost. Considering how many of the strongest and most brilliant effusions of exalted intellect must have perished, how much is it to be regretted that all men of distinguished wisdom and wit have not been attended by friends, of taste enough to relish, and abilities enough to register their conversation; </p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Vixere fortes ante Agamemnona</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Multi, sed omnes illacrymabiles</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Urgentur, ignotique longa</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nocte, carent quia vate sacro.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">They whose inferiour exertions are recorded, as serving to explain or illustrate the sayings of such men, may be proud of being thus associated, and of their names being transmitted to posterity, by being appended to an illustrious character.</p>
<p class="p24">Before I conclude, I think it proper to say, that I have suppressed every thing which I thought could <span class="t8">really</span> hurt any one now living. Vanity and self-conceit indeed may sometimes suffer. With respect to what <span class="t8">is</span> related, I considered it my duty to &lsquo;extenuate nothing, nor set down aught in malice;&rsquo; and with those lighter strokes of Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s satire, proceeding from a warmth and quickness of imagination, not from any malevolence of heart, and which, on account of their excellence, could not be omitted, I trust that they who are the subject of them have good sense and good temper enough not to be displeased.</p>
<p class="p24">I have only to add, that I shall ever reflect with great pleasure on a Tour, which has been the means of preserving so much of the enlightened and instructive conversation of one whose virtues will, I hope, ever be an object of imitation, and whose powers of mind were so extraordinary, that ages may revolve before such a man shall again appear.</p>

<p class="p21">No. I.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">In justice to the ingenious</span> DR. BLACKLOCK, <span class="t8">I publish the following letter from him, relative to a passage in p. 47.</span></p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;TO JAMES BOSWELL, ESQ.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Having lately had the pleasure of reading your account of the journey which you took with Dr. Samuel Johnson to the Western Isles, I take the liberty of transmitting my ideas of the conversation which happened between the doctor and myself concerning Lexicography and Poetry, which, as it is a little different from the delineation exhibited in the former edition of your <span class="t8">Journal</span>, cannot, I hope, be unacceptable; particularly since I have been informed that a second edition of that work is now in contemplation, if not in execution: and I am still more strongly tempted to encourage that hope, from considering that, if every one concerned in the conversations related, were to send you what they can recollect of these colloquial entertainments, many curious and interesting particulars might be recovered, which the most assiduous attention could not observe, nor the most tenacious memory retain. A little reflection, Sir, will convince you, that there is not an axiom in Euclid more intuitive nor more evident than the doctor&rsquo;s assertion that poetry was of much easier execution than lexicography. Any mind therefore endowed with common sense, must have been extremely absent from itself, if it discovered the least astonishment from hearing that a poem might be written with much more facility than the same quantity of a dictionary.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The real cause of my surprise was what appeared to me much more paradoxical, that he could write a sheet of dictionary <span class="t8">with as much pleasure</span> as a sheet of poetry. He acknowledged, indeed, that the latter was much easier than the former. For in the one case, books and a desk were requisite; in the other, you might compose when lying in bed, or walking in the fields, &amp;c. He did not, however, descend to explain, nor to this moment can I comprehend, how the labours of a mere Philologist, in the most refined sense of that term, could give equal pleasure with the exercise of a mind replete with elevated conceptions and pathetic ideas, while taste, fancy, and intellect were deeply enamoured of nature, and in full exertion. You may likewise, perhaps, remember, that when I complained of the ground which Scepticism in religion and morals was continually gaining, it did not appear to be on my own account, as my private opinions upon these important subjects had long been inflexibly determined. What I then deplored, and still deplore, was the unhappy influence which that gloomy hesitation had, not only upon particular characters, but even upon life in general; as being equally the bane of action in our present state, and of such consolations as we might derive from the hopes of a future.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I have the pleasure of remaining with sincere esteem and respect,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Dear Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your most obedient humble servant,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;THOMAS BLACKLOCK.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Edinburgh, Nov. 12, 1785.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I am very happy to find that Dr. Blacklock&rsquo;s apparent uneasiness on the subject of Scepticism was not on his own account, (as I supposed) but from a benevolent concern for the happiness of mankind. With respect, however, to the question concerning poetry, and composing a dictionary, I am confident that my state of Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s position is accurate. One may misconceive the motive by which a person is induced to discuss a particular topick (as in the case of Dr. Blacklock&rsquo;s speaking of Scepticism); but an assertion, like that made by Dr. Johnson, cannot be easily mistaken. And indeed it seems not very probable, that he who so pathetically laments the <span class="t8">drudgery</span> to which the unhappy lexicographer is doomed, and is known to have written his splendid imitation of <span class="t8">Juvenal</span> with astonishing rapidity, should have had &lsquo;as much pleasure in writing a sheet of a dictionary as a sheet of poetry.&rsquo; Nor can I concur with the ingenious writer of the foregoing letter, in thinking it an axiom as evident as any in Euclid, that &lsquo;poetry is of easier execution than lexicography.&rsquo; I have no doubt that Bailey, and the &lsquo;mighty blunderbuss of law,&rsquo; Jacob, wrote ten pages of their respective <span class="t8">Dictionaries</span> with more ease than they could have written five pages of poetry.</p>
<p class="p24">If this book should again be reprinted, I shall with the utmost readiness correct any errours I may have committed, in stating conversations, provided it can be clearly shewn to me that I have been inaccurate. But I am slow to believe, (as I have elsewhere observed) that any man&rsquo;s memory, at the distance of several years, can preserve facts or sayings with such fidelity as may be done by writing them down when they are recent: and I beg it may be remembered, that it is not upon <span class="t8">memory</span>, but upon what was <span class="t8">written at the time</span>, that the authenticity of my <span class="t8">Journal</span> rests.</p>

<p class="p21">THE LIFE OF SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.</p>
<p class="p24">BY <span class="t8">JAMES BOSWELL</span>, ESQ.</p>
<p class="p24">Mr. Boswell has been collecting materials for this work for more than twenty years, during which he was honoured with the intimate friendship of Dr. Johnson; to whose memory he is ambitious to erect a literary monument, worthy of so great an authour, and so excellent a man. Dr. Johnson was well informed of his design, and obligingly communicated to him several curious particulars. With these will be interwoven the most authentick accounts that can be obtained from those who knew him best; many sketches of his conversation on a multiplicity of subjects, with various persons, some of them the most eminent of the age; a great number of letters from him at different periods, and several original pieces dictated by him to Mr. Boswell, distinguished by that peculiar energy, which marked every emanation of his mind.</p>
<p class="p24">Mr. Boswell takes this opportunity of gratefully acknowledging the many valuable communications which he has received to enable him to render his <span class="t8">Life of Dr. Johnson</span> more complete. His thanks are particularly due to the Rev. Dr. Adams, the Rev. Dr. Taylor, Sir Joshua Reynolds, Mr. Langton, Dr. Brocklesby, the Rev. Thomas Warton, Mr. Hector of Birmingham, Mrs. Porter, and Miss Seward.</p>
<p class="p24">He has already obtained a large collection of Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s letters to his friends, and shall be much obliged for such others as yet remain in private hands; which he is the more desirous of collecting, as all the letters of that great man, which he has yet seen, are written with peculiar precision and elegance; and he is confident that the publication of the whole of Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s epistolary correspondence will do him the highest honour.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p10"><span class="t4">APPENDIX A.</span></p>
<p class="p24">(<span class="t8">Page</span> 80.)</p>
<p class="p24">As no one reads Warburton now &mdash; I bought the five volumes of his <span class="t8">Divine Legation</span> in excellent condition, bound in calf, for ten pence &mdash; one or two extracts from his writing may be of interest. His Dedication of that work to the Free-Thinkers is as vigorous as it is abusive. It has such passages as the following:&mdash; &lsquo;Low and mean as your buffoonery is, it is yet to the level of the people:&rsquo; p. xi. &lsquo;I have now done with your buffoonery, which, like chewed bullets, is against the law of arms; and come next to your scurrilities, those stink-pots of your offensive war.&rsquo; <span class="t8">Ib. p. xxii</span>. On page xl. he returns again to their &lsquo;<span class="t8">cold</span> buffoonery.&rsquo; In the Appendix to vol. v, p. 414, he thus wittily replies to Lowth, who had maintained that &lsquo;idolatry was punished under the DOMINION of Melchisedec&rsquo;(p. 409):&mdash; &lsquo;Melchisedec&rsquo;s story is a short one; he is just brought into the scene to <span class="t8">bless</span> Abraham in his return from conquest. This promises but ill. Had this <span class="t8">King and Priest of Salem</span> been brought in <span class="t8">cursing</span>, it had had a better appearance: for, I think, punishment for opinions which generally ends in a <span class="t8">fagot</span> always begins with a <span class="t8">curse</span>. But we may be misled perhaps by a wrong translation. The Hebrew word to <span class="t8">bless</span> signifies likewise to <span class="t8">curse</span>, and under the management of an intolerant priest good things easily run into their contraries. What follows is his taking <span class="t8">tythes</span> from Abraham. Nor will this serve our purpose, unless we interpret these <span class="t8">tythes</span> into <span class="t8">fines for non-conformity</span>; and then by the <span class="t8">blessing</span> we can easily understand <span class="t8">absolution</span>. We have seen much stranger things done with the <span class="t8">Hebrew verity</span>. If this be not allowed, I do not see how we can elicit fire and fagot from this adventure; for I think there is no inseparable connexion between <span class="t8">tythes</span> and <span class="t8">persecution</span> but in the ideas of a Quaker. &mdash; And so much for King Melchisedec. But the learned <span class="t8">Professor</span>, who has been hardily brought up in the keen atmosphere of WHOLESOME SEVERITIES and early taught to distinguish between <span class="t8">de facto</span> and <span class="t8">de jure</span>, thought it &lsquo;needless to enquire into <span class="t8">facts</span>, when he was secure of the <span class="t8">right</span>&rsquo;.</p>
<p class="p24">This &lsquo;keen atmosphere of wholesome severities&rsquo; reappears by the way in Mason&rsquo;s continuation of Gray&rsquo;s Ode to Vicissitude: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;That breathes the keen yet wholesome air</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of rugged penury.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">And later in the first book of Wordsworth&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Excursion</span> (ed. 1857, vi. 29): &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;The keen, the wholesome air of poverty.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson said of Warburton: &lsquo;His abilities gave him an haughty confidence, which he disdained to conceal or mollify; and his impatience of opposition disposed him to treat his adversaries with such contemptuous superiority as made his readers commonly his enemies, and excited against the advocate the wishes of some who favoured the cause. He seems to have adopted the Roman Emperour&rsquo;s determination, <span class="t8">oderint dum metuant</span>; he used no allurements of gentle language, but wished to compel rather than persuade.&rsquo; Johnson&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Works</span>, viii. 288. See <span class="t8">ante</span>, ii. 36, and iv. 46.</p>

<p class="p24">Johnson&rsquo;s use of the word <span class="t8">big</span>, where he says &lsquo;I wish thy books were twice as big,&rsquo; enables me to explain a passage in <span class="t8">The Life of Johnson (ante</span>, iii. 348) which had long puzzled me. Boswell there represents him as saying:&mdash; &lsquo;A man who loses at play, or who runs out his fortune at court, makes his estate less, in hopes of making it <span class="t8">bigger</span>.&rsquo; Boswell adds in a parenthesis:&mdash; &lsquo;I am sure of this word, which was often used by him.&rsquo; He had been criticised by a writer in the <span class="t8">Gent. Mag</span>. 1785, p. 968, who quoting from the text the words &lsquo;a <span class="t8">big</span> book,&rsquo; says:&mdash; &lsquo;Mr. Boswell has made his friend (as in a few other passages) guilty of a <span class="t8">Scotticism</span>. An Englishman reads and writes a <span class="t8">large</span> book, and wears a <span class="t8">great</span> (not a <span class="t8">big</span> or <span class="t8">bag</span>) coat.&rsquo; When Boswell came to publish <span class="t8">The Life of Johnson</span>, he took the opportunity to justify himself, though he did not care to refer directly to his anonymous critic. This explanation I discovered too late to insert in the text.</p>
