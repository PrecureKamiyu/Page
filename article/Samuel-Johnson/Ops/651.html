<p class="p21">Published between 1779 and 1781, this series of biographies finally amounted to a collection composing of 52 short biographies and critical appraisals of various poets, most of whom lived during the eighteenth century. The lives were finally arranged, approximately, by that date of death of the poets. Six of the Lives have been singled out as exemplary works of the most &ldquo;important&rdquo; poets: John Milton, John Dryden, Alexander Pope, Joseph Addison, Jonathan Swift and Thomas Gray. One of the lives, Richard Savage, was previously printed as <span class="t8">An Account of the Life of Mr Richard Savage</span> in 1744.</p>
<p class="p22">In 1773, many publishers in Edinburgh started producing editions of the collected works of various English poets. In order to compete with this interest, Johnson was asked by Tom Davies, William Strahan and Thomas Cadell to create this final major work, <span class="t8">The Lives of the Most Eminent English Poets</span> and for his fee he asked for 200 guineas, an amount significantly lower than the price he could have demanded. Johnson wrote many biographies over the next few years and reproduced his <span class="t8">Life of Savage</span> for the collection.</p>
<p class="p22"><span class="t8">The Lives of the Most Eminent English Poets</span>, which were critical as well as biographical studies, later appeared as prefaces to selections of each poet&rsquo;s work and many resulted being much larger in size than originally intended. As Johnson justified in the Advertisement for the work, &ldquo;my purpose was only to have allotted to every Poet an Advertisement, like those which we find in the French Miscellanies, containing a few dates and a general character.&rdquo; However, he did not limit himself to a dry series of dates and biography, but created a series of Lives with, according to his 1783 edition Preface, &ldquo;the honest intention of giving pleasure&rdquo;.</p>
