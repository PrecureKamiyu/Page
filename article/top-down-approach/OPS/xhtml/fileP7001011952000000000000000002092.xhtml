One router was indistinguishable from another in the sense that all routers executed the same routing algorithm to compute routing paths through the entire network. In practice, this model and its view of a homogenous set of routers all executing the same routing algorithm is simplistic for two important reasons:</p>

The Open in OSPF indicates that the routing protocol specification is publicly available (for example, as opposed to Cisco’s EIGRP protocol, which was only recently became open <a class="biblioref" href="fileP70010119520000000000000000037E0.xhtml#P7001011952000000000000000003BEC" data-foobar="7">[Savage 2015]</a>, after roughly 20 years as a Cisco-proprietary protocol).

With OSPF, each router constructs a complete topological map (that is, a graph) of the entire autonomous system. Each router then locally runs Dijkstra’s shortest-path algorithm to determine a shortest-path tree to all <i>subnets</i>, with itself as the root node. Individual link costs are configured by the network administrator (see sidebar, <a class="xref" href="#P70010119520000000000000000020A4" data-foobar="1">Principles and Practice: Setting OSPF Weights</a>).

In terms of cause and effect, the link weights are given (i.e., they come first) and result (via Dijkstra’s algorithm) in routing paths that minimize overall cost. In this viewpoint, link weights reflect the cost of using a link (e.g., if link weights are inversely proportional to capacity, then the use of high-capacity links would have smaller weight and thus be more attractive from a routing standpoint) and Dijsktra’s algorithm serves to minimize overall cost.</p>

For example, suppose a network operator has an estimate of traffic flow entering the network at each ingress point and destined for each egress point. The operator may then want to put in place a specific routing of ingress-to-egress flows that minimizes the maximum utilization over all of the network’s links. But with a routing algorithm such as OSPF, the operator’s main “knobs” for tuning the routing of flows through the network are the link weights. Thus, in order to achieve the goal of minimizing the maximum link utilization, the operator must find the set of link weights that achieves this goal. This is a reversal of the cause and effect relationship—the desired routing of flows is known, and the OSPF link weights must be found such that the OSPF routing algorithm results in this desired routing of flows.</p>

A router broadcasts link-state information whenever there is a change in a link’s state (for example, a change in cost or a change in up/down status). It also broadcasts a link’s state periodically (at least once every 30 minutes), even if the link’s state has not changed. RFC 2328 notes that “this periodic updating of link state advertisements adds robustness to the link state algorithm.” OSPF advertisements are contained in OSPF messages that are <span class="pagebreak" title="394" id="P70010119520000000000000000020AD" data-uri="M05_KURO4140_07_SE_C05.xhtml#P70010119520000000000000000020AD" epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>carried directly by IP, with an upper-layer protocol of 89 for OSPF. Thus, the OSPF protocol must itself implement functionality such as reliable message transfer and link-state broadcast. The OSPF protocol also checks that links are operational (via a HELLO message that is sent to an attached neighbor) and allows an OSPF router to obtain a neighboring router’s database of network-wide link state.</p>

With authentication, only trusted routers can participate in the OSPF protocol within an AS, thus preventing malicious intruders (or networking students taking their newfound knowledge out for a joyride) from injecting incorrect information into router tables. By default, OSPF packets between routers are not authenticated and could be forged. Two types of authentication can be configured—simple and MD5 (see <a class="xref" href="fileP7001011952000000000000000002D4B.xhtml#P7001011952000000000000000002D4B" data-foobar="7"><span class="label">Chapter</span> <span class="number">8</span></a> for a discussion on MD5 and authentication in general). With simple authentication, the same password is configured on each router. When a router sends an OSPF packet, it includes the password in plaintext. Clearly, simple authentication is not very secure. MD5 authentication is based on shared secret keys that are configured in all the routers. For each OSPF packet that it sends, the router computes the MD5 hash of the content of the OSPF packet appended with the secret key. (See the discussion of message authentication codes in <a class="xref" href="fileP7001011952000000000000000002D4B.xhtml#P7001011952000000000000000002D4B" data-foobar="7"><span class="label">Chapter</span> <span class="number">8</span></a>.) Then the router includes the resulting hash value in the OSPF packet. The receiving router, using the preconfigured secret key, will compute an MD5 hash of the packet and compare it with the hash value that the packet carries, thus verifying the packet’s authenticity. Sequence numbers are also used with MD5 authentication to protect against replay attacks.</p></li>
