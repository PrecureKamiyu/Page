The timelines are similarly hash marked, and the measurements on the hash marks in the departures timeline are the same as in figure 4.11. In this illustration, however, the packets are color coded, either dark or light blue. The packets that appear in between the two timelines appear, from left to right, as: packet 1 (dark blue), packet 3 (dark blue), packet 2 (light blue), packet 4 (dark blue), and packet 5 (light blue).</p><p id="P700101195200000000000000000A862" data-uri="M04_KURO4140_07_SE_C04.xhtml#P700101195200000000000000000A862">In the arrivals timeline, packet 1 appears on the first hash mark. Packet 2 appears between the second and third hash mark, packet 3 appears between the third and fourth hash mark. Packet 4 appears just after the eighth hash mark, and packet 5 appears at the fourteenth hash mark. In the departures timeline, packet 1 appears at t = 3, packet 2 appears at t = 6, packet 3 appears at t = 9, packet 4 appears at t = 12, and packet 5 appears two hash marks beyond t = 14.</p></div></section></body></html>
