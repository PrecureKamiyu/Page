<h2 class="h20"><a id="a1317"></a>A</h2>
<p class="p32">The first letter of the European alphabets, has, in the English language, three different sounds, which may be termed the broad, open, and slender.</p>
<p class="p32">The broad sound resembling that of the German <span class="t8">a</span> is found, in many of our monosyllables, as <span class="t8">all</span>, <span class="t8">wall</span>, <span class="t8">malt</span>, <span class="t8">falt</span>; in which <span class="t8">a</span> is pronounced as <span class="t8">au</span> in <span class="t8">cause</span>, or <span class="t8">aw</span> in <span class="t8">law</span>. Many of these words were anciently written with <span class="t8">au</span>, as <span class="t8">sault, waulk</span>; which happens to be still retained in <span class="t8">fault</span>. This was probably the ancient sound of the Saxons, since it is almost uniformly preserved in the rustic pronunciation, and the Northern dialects, as <span class="t8">maun</span> for <span class="t8">man</span>, <span class="t8">haund</span> for <span class="t8">hand</span>.</p>
<p class="p32"><span class="t8">A</span> open, not unlike the <span class="t8">a</span> of the Italians, is found in <span class="t8">father, rather</span>, and more obscurely in <span class="t8">fancy, fast</span>, &amp;c.</p>
<p class="p32"><span class="t8">A</span> slender or close, is the peculiar <span class="t8">a</span> of the English language, resembling the sound of the French <span class="t8">e</span> masculine, or diphthong <span class="t8">ai</span> in <span class="t8">païs</span>, or perhaps a middle sound between them, or between the <span class="t8">a</span> and <span class="t8">e</span>; to this the Arabic <span class="t8">a</span> is said nearly to approach. Of this sound we have examples in the words, <span class="t8">place, face, waste,</span> and all those that terminate in <span class="t8">ation</span>; as, <span class="t8">relation, nation, generation</span>.</p>
<p class="p32"><span class="t8">A</span> is short, as, <span class="t8">glass, grass</span>; or long, as, <span class="t8">glaze, graze</span>: it is marked long, generally, by an <span class="t8">e</span> final, <span class="t8">plane</span>, or by an <span class="t8">i</span> added, as, <span class="t8">plain</span>.</p>
<p class="p32"><span class="t25">A</span>, in abbreviations, stands for <span class="t8">artium</span>, or arts; as, A.B. bachelor of arts, <span class="t8">artium baccalaureus</span>; A.M. master of arts, <span class="t8">artium magister</span>; or, <span class="t8">anno</span>; as, A.D. <span class="t8">anno domini</span>. <span class="t25">A</span>, an article set before nouns of the singular number; <span class="t8">a</span> man, <span class="t8">a</span> tree; denoting the number <span class="t8">one</span>, as, <span class="t8">a</span> man is coming, that is, <span class="t8">no more than one</span>; or an indefinite indication, as, <span class="t8">a</span> man may come this way; that is, <span class="t8">any</span> man. This article has no plural signification. Before a word beginning with a vowel, it is written <span class="t8">an</span>, as, <span class="t8">an</span> ox, <span class="t8">an</span> egg, of which <span class="t8">a</span> is the contraction.</p>
<p class="p32"><span class="t8">A</span> is sometimes a noun; as, a great <span class="t8">A</span>, a little <span class="t8">a</span>.</p>
<p class="p32"><span class="t8">A</span> is placed before a participle, or participial noun; and is considered by Wallis as a contraction of <span class="t8">at</span>, when it is put before a word denoting some action not yet finished; as, I am <span class="t8">a</span> walking. It also seems to be anciently contracted from <span class="t8">at</span>, when placed before local surnames; as, Thomas <span class="t8">a</span> Becket. In other cases, it seems to signify <span class="t8">to</span>, like the French <span class="t8">à</span>.</p>
<p class="p32"><span class="t8">A</span> hunting Chloë went. <span class="t8">Prior.</span></p>
<p class="p32">They go <span class="t8">a</span> begging to a bankrupt&rsquo;s door. <span class="t8">Dryd.</span></p>
<p class="p33">May pure contents for ever pitch their tents<br/>Upon these downs, these meads, these rocks, these mountains,<br/>And peace still slumber by these purling fountains!<br/>Which we may every year<br/>Find when we come <span class="t8">a</span> fishing here. <span class="t8">Wotton.</span></p>
<p class="p32">Now the men fell <span class="t8">a</span> rubbing of armour, which a great while had lain oiled; the magazines of munition are viewed; the officers of remains called to account. <span class="t8">Wotton.</span></p>
<p class="p32">Another falls <span class="t8">a</span> ringing a Pescennius Niger, and judiciously distinguishes the sound of it to be modern. <span class="t8">Addison on medals.</span></p>
<p class="p32"><span class="t8">A</span> has a peculiar signification, denoting the proportion of one thing to another. Thus we say, The landlord hath a hundred <span class="t8">a</span> year; The ship&rsquo;s crew gained a thousand pounds <span class="t8">a</span> man.</p>
<p class="p32">The river Inn, that had been hitherto shut up among mountains, passes generally through a wide open country, during all its course through Bavaria; which is a voyage of two days, after the rate of twenty leagues <span class="t8">a</span> day. <span class="t8">Addison on Italy</span>.</p>
<p class="p32"><span class="t8">A</span> is used in burlesque poetry, to lengthen out a syllable, without adding to the sense.</p>
<p class="p33">For cloves and nutmegs to the line-<span class="t8">a</span>,<br/>And even for oranges to China. <span class="t8">Dryden.</span></p>
<p class="p32"><span class="t8">A</span> is sometimes, in familiar writings, put by a barbarous corruption for <span class="t8">he</span>.</p>
<p class="p32"><span class="t25">A</span>, in composition, seems to have sometimes the power of the French <span class="t8">a</span> in these phrases, <span class="t8">a droit</span>, <span class="t8">a gauche</span>, &amp;c. and sometimes to be contracted from <span class="t8">at</span>; as, <span class="t8">aside, aslope, afoot, asleep, athirst, aware.</span></p>
<p class="p33">If this, which he avouches, does appear,<br/>There is no flying hence, nor tarrying here.<br/>I gin to be <span class="t8">a weary</span> of the fun;<br/>And with the state of the world were now undone. <span class="t8">Shakespeare&rsquo;s Macbeth.</span></p>
<p class="p33">And now a breeze from shore began to blow,<br/>The sailors ship their oars, and cease to row;<br/>Then hoist their yards <span class="t8">a-trip</span>, and all their fails<br/>Let fall, to court the wind, and catch the gales. <span class="t8">Dryden&rsquo;s Ceyx and Alcyone.</span></p>
<p class="p32"><span class="t8">A</span> is sometimes redundant; as, <span class="t8">arise, arouse, awake</span>; the same with rise, rouse, wake.</p>

<p class="p32">To <span class="t25">Abate</span>. <span class="t8">v.n.</span> To grow less; as, his passion abates; the storm abates. It is used sometimes with the particle <span class="t8">of</span> before the thing lessened.</p>

<p class="p32">4. The cause of abating; extenuation.</p>

<p class="p32">There is likewise another oath of <span class="t8">abjuration</span>, which laymen and clergymen are both obliged to take; and that is, to abjure the Pretender. <span class="t8">Ayliffe&rsquo;s Parergon Juris Canonici.</span></p>

<p class="p32">The tenure in chief ought to be kept alive and nourished; the which, as it is the very root that doth maintain this silver stem, that by many rich and fruitful branches spreadeth itself into the chancery, exchequer, and court of wards: so if it be suffered to starve, by want of <span class="t8">ablaqueation</span>, and other good husbandry, not only this yearly fruit will much decrease from time to time, but also the whole body and boughs of that precious tree itself, will fall into danger of decay and dying. <span class="t8">Bacon&rsquo;s Office of Alienations</span>.</p>
<p class="p32"><span class="t25">Ablátion</span>. <span class="t8">n.s.</span> [<span class="t8">ablatio</span>, Lat.] The act of taking away.<span class="t25"> Áblative</span>. <span class="t8">n.a.</span> [<span class="t8">ablativus</span>, Lat.]</p>
