The early versions of TCP, however, were quite different from today’s TCP. The early versions of TCP combined a reliable in-sequence delivery of data via end-system retransmission (still part of today’s TCP) with forwarding functions (which today are performed by IP). Early experimentation with TCP, combined with the recognition of the importance of an unreliable, non-flow-controlled, end-to-end transport service for applications such as packetized voice, led to the separation of IP out of TCP and the development of the UDP protocol. The three key Internet protocols that we see today—TCP, UDP, and IP—were conceptually in place by the end of the 1970s.</p>

In Hawaii, Norman Abramson was developing ALOHAnet, a packet-based radio network that allowed multiple remote sites on the Hawaiian Islands to communicate with each other. The ALOHA protocol <a class="biblioref" href="fileP70010119520000000000000000037E0.xhtml#P70010119520000000000000000037E8" data-foobar="7">[Abramson 1970]</a> was the first multiple-access protocol, allowing geographically distributed users to share a single broadcast communication medium (a radio ­frequency). Metcalfe and Boggs built on Abramson’s multiple-access protocol work when they developed the Ethernet protocol <a class="biblioref" href="fileP70010119520000000000000000037E0.xhtml#P7001011952000000000000000003A4C" data-foobar="7">[Metcalfe 1976]</a> for wire-based shared broadcast networks. Interestingly, Metcalfe and Boggs’ Ethernet protocol was motivated by the need to connect multiple PCs, printers, and shared disks <a class="biblioref" href="fileP70010119520000000000000000037E0.xhtml#P7001011952000000000000000003AA0" data-foobar="7">[Perkins 1994]</a>.

By the end of the 1980s the number of hosts connected to the public ­Internet, a confederation of networks looking much like today’s Internet, would reach a hundred thousand. The 1980s would be a time of tremendous growth.</p>

BITNET provided e-mail and file transfers among several universities in the Northeast. CSNET (computer science network) was formed to link university researchers who did not have access to ARPAnet. In 1986, NSFNET was created to provide access to NSF-sponsored supercomputing centers. Starting with an initial backbone speed of 56 kbps, NSFNET’s backbone would be running at 1.5 Mbps by the end of the decade and would serve as a primary backbone linking regional networks.</p>

January 1, 1983 saw the official deployment of TCP/IP as the new standard host protocol for ARPAnet (replacing the NCP protocol).

Sponsored by the French government, the Minitel system consisted of a public packet-switched network (based on the X.25 protocol suite), Minitel servers, and inexpensive terminals with built-in low-speed modems. The Minitel became a huge success in 1984 when the French government gave away a free Minitel terminal to each French household that wanted one. Minitel sites included free sites—such as a telephone directory site—as well as private sites, which collected a usage-based fee from each user. At its peak in the mid 1990s, it offered more than 20,000 services, ranging from home banking to specialized research databases. The Minitel was in a large proportion of French homes 10 years before most Americans had ever heard of the Internet.</p>

ARPAnet, the progenitor of the Internet, ceased to exist. In 1991, NSFNET lifted its restrictions on the use of NSFNET for commercial purposes. NSFNET itself would be decommissioned in 1995, with Internet backbone traffic being carried by commercial Internet Service Providers.</p>

The Web served as a platform for enabling and deploying hundreds of new applications that we take for granted today, including search (e.g., Google and Bing) Internet commerce (e.g., Amazon and eBay) and social networks (e.g., Facebook).</p>

Before they were even profitable, hundreds of Internet startups made initial public offerings and started to be traded in a stock market. Many companies were valued in the billions of dollars without having any significant revenue streams. The Internet stocks collapsed in 2000–2001, and many startups shut down. Nevertheless, a number of companies emerged as big winners in the Internet space, including Microsoft, Cisco, Yahoo, e-Bay, Google, and Amazon.</p>
