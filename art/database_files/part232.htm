These storage media are classiﬁed by the speed with which data can be accessed, by the cost per unit of data to buy the medium, and by the medium’s reliability. Among the media typically available are these:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s39" style="padding-left: 139pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: justify;">• <span class="s63">Cache</span><span class="p">. The cache is the fastest and most costly form of storage. Cache memory is relatively small; its use is managed by the computer system hardware. We shall not be concerned about managing cache storage in the database system. It is, however, worth noting that database implementors do pay attention to cache eﬀects when designing query processing data structures and algorithms, and we shall return to this issue in later chapters.</span></p><p class="s39" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 139pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: justify;">• <span class="s63">Main memory</span><span class="p">. The storage medium used for data that are available to be operated on is main memory. The general-purpose machine instructions operate on main memory. Main memory may contain tens of gigabytes of data on a personal com-</span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 119pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;">559</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 107pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">puter, and even hundreds to thousands of gigabytes of data in large server systems. It is generally too small (or too expensive) for storing the entire database for very large databases, but many enterprise databases can ﬁt in main memory. However, the contents of main memory are lost in the event of a power failure or system crash; main memory is therefore said to be <span class="s63">volatile</span>.</p><p class="s63" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 107pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s39">• </span>Flash memory<span class="p">. Flash memory diﬀers from main memory in that stored data are retained even if power is turned oﬀ (or fails)— that is, it is </span>non-volatile<span class="p">. Flash mem- ory has a lower cost per byte than main memory, but a higher cost per byte than magnetic disks.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 107pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">Flash memory is widely used for data storage in devices such as cameras and cell phones. Flash memory is also used for storing data in “<span class="s44">USB </span>ﬂash drives,” also known as “pen drives,” which can be plugged into the <i>Universal Serial Bus </i>(<span class="s44">USB</span>) slots of computing devices.</p><p style="padding-left: 107pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">Flash memory is also increasingly used as a replacement for magnetic disks in personal computers as well as in servers. A <span class="s63">solid-state drive </span>(<span class="s64">SSD</span>) uses ﬂash memory internally to store data but provides an interface similar to a magnetic disk, allowing data to be stored or retrieved in units of a block; such an interface is called a <i>block-oriented interface</i>. Block sizes typically range from 512 bytes to 8- kilobytes. As of 2018, a 1-terabyte <span class="s44">SSD </span>costs around $250. We provide more details about ﬂash memory in Section 12.4.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 107pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s39">• </span><span class="s63">Magnetic-disk storage</span>. The primary medium for the long-term online storage of data is the magnetic disk drive, which is also referred to as the <span class="s63">hard disk drive </span>(<span class="s64">HDD</span>). Magnetic disk, like ﬂash memory, is non-volatile: that is, magnetic disk storage survives power failures and system crashes. Disks may sometimes fail and destroy data, but such failures are quite rare compared to system crashes or power failures.</p><p style="padding-left: 107pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">To access data stored on magnetic disk, the system must ﬁrst move the data from disk to main memory, from where they can be accessed. After the system has performed the designated operations, the data that have been modiﬁed must be written to disk.</p><p style="padding-left: 107pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">Disk capacities have grown steadily over the years. As of 2018, the size of mag- netic disks ranges from 500 gigabytes to 14 terabytes, and a 1-terabyte disk costs about $50, while an 8-terabyte disk around $150. Although signiﬁcantly cheaper than <span class="s44">SSDs</span>, magnetic disks provide lower performance in terms of number of data access operations that they can support per second. We provide further details about magnetic disks in Section 12.3.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 107pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s39">• </span><span class="s63">Optical storage</span>. The <i>digital video disk </i>(<span class="s44">DVD</span>) is an optical storage medium, with data written and read back using a laser light source. The <i>Blu-ray </i><span class="s101">DVD </span>format has a capacity of 27 gigabytes to 128 gigabytes, depending on the number of layers supported. Although the original (and still main) use of <span class="s44">DVD</span>s was to store video data, they are capable of storing any type of digital data, including backups of</p><p class="s66" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 293pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">12.1 <span style=" color: #00AEEF;">Overview of Physical Storage Media  </span><span class="s164">561</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 139pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">database contents. <span class="s44">DVD</span>s are not suitable for storing active database data since the time required to access a given piece of data can be quite long compared to the time taken by a magnetic disk.</p><p style="padding-left: 139pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">Some <span class="s44">DVD </span>versions are read-only, written at the factory where they are pro- duced, other versions support <i>write-once</i>, allowing them to be written once, but not overwritten, and some versions can be rewritten multiple times. Disks that can be written only once are called <b>write-once, read-many </b>(<span class="s44">WORM</span>) disks.</p><p style="padding-left: 139pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">Optical disk <span class="s63">jukebox </span>systems contain a few drives and numerous disks that can be loaded into one of the drives automatically (by a robot arm) on demand.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 139pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s39">• </span><span class="s63">Tape storage</span>. Tape storage is used primarily for backup and archival data. <i>Archival </i>data refers to data that must be stored safely for a long period of time, often for legal reasons. Magnetic tape is cheaper than disks and can safely store data for many years. However, access to data is much slower because the tape must be accessed sequentially from the beginning of the tape; tapes can be very long, requiring tens to hundreds of seconds to access data. For this reason, tape storage is referred to as <span class="s63">sequential-access </span>storage. In contrast, magnetic disk and <span class="s44">SSD </span>storage are referred to as <span class="s63">direct-access </span>storage because it is possible to read data from any location on disk.</p><p style="padding-left: 139pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">Tapes have a high capacity (1 to 12 terabyte capacities are currently available), and can be removed from the tape drive. Tape drives tend to be expensive, but in- dividual tapes are usually signiﬁcantly cheaper than magnetic disks of the same capacity. As a result, tapes are well suited to cheap archival storage and to trans- ferring large amounts of data between diﬀerent locations. Archival storage of large video ﬁles, as well as storage of large volumes of scientiﬁc data, which can range up to many petabytes (1 petabyte = 10<span class="s76">15</span> bytes) of data, are two common use cases for tapes.</p><p style="padding-left: 139pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">Tape libraries (jukeboxes) are used to hold large collections of tapes, allowing automated storage and retrieval of tapes without human intervention.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 119pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">The various storage media can be organized in a hierarchy (Figure 12.1) according to their speed and their cost. The higher levels are expensive, but fast. As we move down the hierarchy, the cost per bit decreases, whereas the access time increases. This trade-oﬀ is reasonable; if a given storage system were both faster and less expensive than another— other properties being the same— then there would be no reason to use the slower, more expensive memory.</p><p style="padding-left: 119pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">The fastest storage media— for example, cache and main memory— are referred to as <span class="s63">primary storage</span>. The media in the next level in the hierarchy— for example, ﬂash memory and magnetic disks — are referred to as <span class="s63">secondary storage</span>, or <span class="s63">online storage</span>. The media in the lowest level in the hierarchy— for example, magnetic tape and optical- disk jukeboxes — are referred to as <span class="s63">tertiary storage</span>, or <span class="s63">oﬄine storage</span>.</p><p style="padding-left: 119pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">In addition to the speed and cost of the various storage systems, there is also the issue of storage volatility. In the hierarchy shown in Figure 12.1, the storage systems</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="325" height="276" alt="image" src="Image_2530.png"/></span></p><p class="s42" style="padding-left: 87pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: center;">magnetic tapes</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p class="s42" style="padding-left: 81pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: center;">optical disk</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p class="s42" style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: center;">magnetic disk</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p class="s42" style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">flash memory</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p class="s42" style="padding-left: 40pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">main memory</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p class="s42" style="padding-left: 43pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: center;">cache</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p class="s73" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 59pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><a name="bookmark256">Figure 12.1 </a><span class="s74">Storage device hierarchy.</span><a name="bookmark291">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 88pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">from main memory up are volatile, whereas the storage systems from ﬂash memory down are non-volatile. Data must be written to non-volatile storage for safekeeping. We shall return to the subject of safe storage of data in the face of system failures later, in Chapter 19.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part231.htm">&lt; 上一个</a><span> | </span><a href="../database.html">内容</a><span> | </span><a href="part233.htm">下一个 &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
