The gray bands are labeled "4KHz." The block itself is labeled "Link," and the width of the block, from top to bottom, is labeled "Frequency."</p><p id="P70010119520000000000000000097E5" data-uri="M01_KURO4140_07_SE_C01.xhtml#P70010119520000000000000000097E5">In this illustration of TDM, the circuit is depicted as a long rectangle that is divided up with vertical lines into many small segments. These segments are numbered 1-4 and color-coded: 1 is white, 2 is dark blue, 3 is light blue, and 4 is a medium shade of blue. Individual segments are labeled "Slot" and the groupings of fours are labeled "Frame." A key notes that: "All slots labeled '2' are dedicated to a specific sender-receiver pair." The entire circuit, from left to right, is labeled "Time."</p><p id="P70010119520000000000000000097E6" data-uri="M01_KURO4140_07_SE_C01.xhtml#P70010119520000000000000000097E6">In this illustration of TDM, the circuit is depicted as a long rectangle that is divided up with vertical lines into many small segments.
