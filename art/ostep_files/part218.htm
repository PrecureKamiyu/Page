In either type of system, if a page is not present, the OS is put in charge to handle the page fault. The appropriately-named OS <b>page-fault handler </b>runs to determine what to do. Virtually all systems handle page faults in software; even with a hardware-managed TLB, the hardware trusts the OS to manage this important duty.</p><p style="padding-left: 68pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">If a page is not present and has been swapped to disk, the OS will need to swap the page into memory in order to service the page fault. Thus, a question arises: how will the OS know where to find the desired page? In many systems, the page table is a natural place to store such information. Thus, the OS could use the bits in the PTE normally used for data such as the PFN of the page for a disk address. When the OS receives a page fault for a page, it looks in the PTE to find the address, and issues the request to disk to fetch the page into memory.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s27" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;"><span class="p">A</span><span class="s7">SIDE</span><span class="p">: </span>W<span class="s45">HY </span>H<span class="s45">ARDWARE </span>D<span class="s45">OESN</span>’<span class="s45">T </span>H<span class="s45">ANDLE </span>P<span class="s45">AGE </span>F<span class="s45">AULTS</span></p><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">We know from our experience with the TLB that hardware designers are loathe to trust the OS to do much of anything. So why do they trust the OS to handle a page fault? There are a few main reasons. First, page faults to disk are <i>slow</i>; even if the OS takes a long time to handle a fault, executing tons of instructions, the disk operation itself is traditionally so slow that the extra overheads of running software are minimal. Second, to be able to handle a page fault, the hardware would have to understand swap space, how to issue I/Os to the disk, and a lot of other details which it currently doesn’t know much about. Thus, for both reasons of perfor- mance and simplicity, the OS handles page faults, and even hardware types can be happy.</p><p style="padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">When the disk I/O completes, the OS will then update the page table to mark the page as present, update the PFN field of the page-table entry (PTE) to record the in-memory location of the newly-fetched page, and retry the instruction. This next attempt may generate a TLB miss, which would then be serviced and update the TLB with the translation (one could alternately update the TLB upon when servicing the page fault, to avoid this step). Finally, a last restart would find the translation in the TLB and thus proceed to fetch the desired data or instruction from memory at the translated physical address.</p><p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Note that while the I/O is in flight, the process will be in the <b>blocked </b>state. Thus, the OS will be free to run other ready processes while the page fault is being serviced. Because I/O is expensive, this <b>overlap </b>of the I/O (page fault) of one process and the execution of another is yet another way a multiprogrammed system can make the most effective use of its hardware.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part217.htm">&lt; 上一个</a><span> | </span><a href="../ostep.html">内容</a><span> | </span><a href="part219.htm">下一个 &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
