<p class="p24">On Monday, April 29, I found him at home in the forenoon, and Mr. Seward with him. Horace having been mentioned; BOSWELL. &lsquo;There is a great deal of thinking in his works. One finds there almost every thing but religion.&rsquo; SEWARD. &lsquo;He speaks of his returning to it, in his Ode Parcus Deorum cultor et infrequens.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, he was not in earnest: this was merely poetical.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;There are, I am afraid, many people who have no religion at all.&rsquo; SEWARD. &lsquo;And sensible people too.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, not sensible in that respect. There must be either a natural or a moral stupidity, if one lives in a total neglect of so very important a concern. SEWARD. &lsquo;I wonder that there should be people without religion.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, you need not wonder at this, when you consider how large a proportion of almost every man&rsquo;s life is passed without thinking of it. I myself was for some years totally regardless of religion. It had dropped out of my mind. It was at an early part of my life. Sickness brought it back, and I hope I have never lost it since.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;My dear Sir, what a man must you have been without religion! Why you must have gone on drinking, and swearing, and&mdash; &lsquo; JOHNSON (with a smile,) &lsquo;I drank enough and swore enough, to be sure.&rsquo; SEWARD. &lsquo;One should think that sickness and the view of death would make more men religious.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, they do not know how to go about it: they have not the first notion. A man who has never had religion before, no more grows religious when he is sick, than a man who has never learnt figures can count when he has need of calculation.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I mentioned Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s excellent distinction between liberty of conscience and liberty of teaching. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Consider, Sir; if you have children whom you wish to educate in the principles of the Church of England, and there comes a Quaker who tries to pervert them to his principles, you would drive away the Quaker. You would not trust to the predomination of right, which you believe is in your opinions; you would keep wrong out of their heads. Now the vulgar are the children of the State. If any one attempts to teach them doctrines contrary to what the State approves, the magistrate may and ought to restrain him.&rsquo; SEWARD. &lsquo;Would you restrain private conversation, Sir?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, it is difficult to say where private conversation begins, and where it ends. If we three should discuss even the great question concerning the existence of a Supreme Being by ourselves, we should not be restrained; for that would be to put an end to all improvement. But if we should discuss it in the presence of ten boarding-school girls, and as many boys, I think the magistrate would do well to put us in the stocks, to finish the debate there.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;How false (said he,) is all this, to say that in ancient times learning was not a disgrace to a Peer as it is now. In ancient times a Peer was as ignorant as any one else. He would have been angry to have it thought he could write his name. Men in ancient times dared to stand forth with a degree of ignorance with which nobody would dare now to stand forth. I am always angry when I hear ancient times praised at the expence of modern times. There is now a great deal more learning in the world than there was formerly; for it is universally diffused. You have, perhaps, no man who knows as much Greek and Latin as Bentley; no man who knows as much mathematicks as Newton: but you have many more men who know Greek and Latin, and who know mathematicks.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Thursday, May 1, I visited him in the evening along with young Mr. Burke. He said, &lsquo;It is strange that there should be so little reading in the world, and so much writing. People in general do not willingly read, if they can have any thing else to amuse them. There must be an external impulse; emulation, or vanity, or avarice. The progress which the understanding makes through a book, has more pain than pleasure in it. Language is scanty, and inadequate to express the nice gradations and mixtures of our feelings. No man reads a book of science from pure inclination. The books that we do read with pleasure are light compositions, which contain a quick succession of events. However, I have this year read all Virgil through. I read a book of the Aeneid every night, so it was done in twelve nights, and I had great delight in it. The Georgicks did not give me so much pleasure, except the fourth book. The Eclogues I have almost all by heart. I do not think the story of the Aeneid interesting. I like the story of the Odyssey much better; and this not on account of the wonderful things which it contains; for there are wonderful things enough in the Aeneid; &mdash; the ships of the Trojans turned to sea-nymphs, &mdash; the tree at Polydorus&rsquo;s tomb dropping blood. The story of the Odyssey is interesting, as a great part of it is domestick. It has been said, there is pleasure in writing, particularly in writing verses. I allow you may have pleasure from writing, after it is over, if you have written well; but you don&rsquo;t go willingly to it again. I know when I have been writing verses, I have run my finger down the margin, to see how many I had made, and how few I had to make.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He seemed to be in a very placid humour, and although I have no note of the particulars of young Mr. Burke&rsquo;s conversation, it is but justice to mention in general, that it was such that Dr. Johnson said to me afterwards, &lsquo;He did very well indeed; I have a mind to tell his father.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I have no minute of any interview with Johnson till Thursday, May 15, when I find what follows: &mdash; BOSWELL. &lsquo;I wish much to be in Parliament, Sir.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, unless you come resolved to support any administration, you would be the worse for being in Parliament, because you would be obliged to live more expensively.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Perhaps, Sir, I should be the less happy for being in Parliament. I never would sell my vote, and I should be vexed if things went wrong.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;That&rsquo;s cant, Sir. It would not vex you more in the house, than in the gallery: publick affairs vex no man.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Have not they vexed yourself a little, Sir? Have not you been vexed by all the turbulence of this reign, and by that absurd vote of the house of Commons, &ldquo;That the influence of the Crown has increased, is increasing, and ought to be diminished?&rdquo;&rsquo; Johnson. &lsquo;Sir, I have never slept an hour less, nor eat an ounce less meat. I would have knocked the factious dogs on the head, to be sure; but I was not VEXED.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;I declare, Sir, upon my honour, I did imagine I was vexed, and took a pride in it; but it WAS, perhaps, cant; for I own I neither ate less, nor slept less.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;My dear friend, clear your MIND of cant. You may TALK as other people do: you may say to a man, &ldquo;Sir, I am your most humble servant.&rdquo; You are not his most humble servant. You may say, &ldquo;These are bad times; it is a melancholy thing to be reserved to such times.&rdquo; You don&rsquo;t mind the times. You tell a man, &ldquo;I am sorry you had such bad weather the last day of your journey, and were so much wet.&rdquo; You don&rsquo;t care six-pence whether he is wet or dry. You may TALK in this manner; it is a mode of talking in Society: but don&rsquo;t THINK foolishly.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Here he discovered a notion common enough in persons not much accustomed to entertain company, that there must be a degree of elaborate attention, otherwise company will think themselves neglected; and such attention is no doubt very fatiguing. He proceeded: &lsquo;I would not, however, be a stranger in my own county; I would visit my neighbours, and receive their visits; but I would not be in haste to return visits. If a gentleman comes to see me, I tell him he does me a great deal of honour. I do not go to see him perhaps for ten weeks; then we are very complaisant to each other. No, Sir, you will have much more influence by giving or lending money where it is wanted, than by hospitality.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Saturday, May 17, I saw him for a short time. Having mentioned that I had that morning been with old Mr. Sheridan, he remembered their former intimacy with a cordial warmth, and said to me, &lsquo;Tell Mr. Sheridan, I shall be glad to see him, and shake hands with him.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;It is to me very wonderful that resentment should be kept up so long.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, it is not altogether resentment that he does not visit me; it is partly falling out of the habit, &mdash; partly disgust, as one has at a drug that has made him sick. Besides, he knows that I laugh at his oratory.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Another day I spoke of one of our friends, of whom he, as well as I, had a very high opinion. He expatiated in his praise; but added, &lsquo;Sir, he is a cursed Whig, a BOTTOMLESS Whig, as they all are now.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Monday, May 26, I found him at tea, and the celebrated Miss Burney, the authour of Evelina and Cecilia, with him. I asked if there would be any speakers in Parliament, if there were no places to be obtained. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Yes, Sir. Why do you speak here? Either to instruct and entertain, which is a benevolent motive; or for distinction, which is a selfish motive.&rsquo; I mentioned Cecilia. JOHNSON. (with an air of animated satisfaction,) &lsquo;Sir, if you talk of Cecilia, talk on.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">We talked of Mr. Barry&rsquo;s exhibition of his pictures. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Whatever the hand may have done, the mind has done its part. There is a grasp of mind there which you find nowhere else.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I asked whether a man naturally virtuous, or one who has overcome wicked inclinations, is the best. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, to YOU, the man who has overcome wicked inclinations is not the best. He has more merit to HIMSELF: I would rather trust my money to a man who has no hands, and so a physical impossibility to steal, than to a man of the most honest principles. There is a witty satirical story of Foote. He had a small bust of Garrick placed upon his bureau. &ldquo;You may be surprized (said he,) that I allow him to be so near my gold; &mdash; but you will observe he has no hands.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Friday, May 29, being to set out for Scotland next morning, I passed a part of the day with him in more than usual earnestness; as his health was in a more precarious state than at any time when I had parted from him. He, however, was quick and lively, and critical as usual. I mentioned one who was a very learned man. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Yes, Sir, he has a great deal of learning; but it never lies straight. There is never one idea by the side of another; &rsquo;tis all entangled: and their he drives it so aukwardly upon conversation.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He said, &lsquo;Get as much force of mind as you can. Live within your income. Always have something saved at the end of the year. Let your imports be more than your exports, and you&rsquo;ll never go far wrong.</p>
<p class="p24">I assured him, that in the extensive and various range of his acquaintance there never had been any one who had a more sincere respect and affection for him than I had. He said, &lsquo;I believe it, Sir. Were I in distress, there is no man to whom I should sooner come than to you. I should like to come and have a cottage in your park, toddle about, live mostly on milk, and be taken care of by Mrs. Boswell. She and I are good friends now; are we not?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He embraced me, and gave me his blessing, as usual when I was leaving him for any length of time. I walked from his door to-day, with a fearful apprehension of what might happen before I returned.</p>
<p class="p24">My anxious apprehensions at parting with him this year, proved to be but too well founded; for not long afterwards he had a dreadful stroke of the palsy, of which there are very full and accurate accounts in letters written by himself, to shew with what composure of mind, and resignation to the Divine Will, his steady piety enabled him to behave.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;TO MR. EDMUND ALLEN.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;DEAR SIR, &mdash; It has pleased GOD, this morning, to deprive me of the powers of speech; and as I do not know but that it may be his further good pleasure to deprive me soon of my senses, I request you will on the receipt of this note, come to me, and act for me, as the exigencies of my case may require. I am, sincerely yours,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;June 17, 1783.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Two days after he wrote thus to Mrs. Thrale: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;On Monday, the 16th, I sat for my picture, and walked a considerable way with little inconvenience. In the afternoon and evening I felt myself light and easy, and began to plan schemes of life. Thus I went to bed, and in a short time waked and sat up, as has been long my custom, when I felt a confusion and indistinctness in my head, which lasted, I suppose, about half a minute. I was alarmed, and prayed God, that however he might afflict my body, he would spare my understanding. This prayer, that I might try the integrity of my faculties, I made in Latin verse. The lines were not very good, but I knew them not to be very good: I made them easily, and concluded myself to be unimpaired in my faculties.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Soon after I perceived that I had suffered a paralytick stroke, and that my speech was taken from me. I had no pain, and so little dejection in this dreadful state, that I wondered at my own apathy, and considered that perhaps death itself, when it should come, would excite less horrour than seems now to attend it.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;In order to rouse the vocal organs, I took two drams. Wine has been celebrated for the production of eloquence. I put myself into violent motion, and I think repeated it; but all was vain. I then went to bed, and strange as it may seem, I think slept. When I saw light, it was time to contrive what I should do. Though God stopped my speech, he left me my hand; I enjoyed a mercy which was not granted to my dear friend Lawrence, who now perhaps overlooks me as I am writing, and rejoices that I have what he wanted. My first note was necessarily to my servant, who came in talking, and could not immediately comprehend why he should read what I put into his hands.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I then wrote a card to Mr. Allen, that I might have a discreet friend at hand, to act as occasion should require. In penning this note, I had some difficulty; my hand, I knew not how nor why, made wrong letters. I then wrote to Dr. Taylor to come to me, and bring Dr. Heberden; and I sent to Dr. Brocklesby, who is my neighbour. My physicians are very friendly, and give me great hopes; but you may imagine my situation. I have so far recovered my vocal powers, as to repeat the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer with no very imperfect articulation. My memory, I hope, yet remains as it was; but such an attack produces solicitude for the safety of every faculty.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;TO MR. THOMAS DAVIES.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;DEAR SIR, &mdash; I have had, indeed, a very heavy blow; but GOD, who yet spares my life, I humbly hope will spare my understanding, and restore my speech. As I am not at all helpless, I want no particular assistance, but am strongly affected by Mrs. Davies&rsquo;s tenderness; and when I think she can do me good, shall be very glad to call upon her. I had ordered friends to be shut out; but one or two have found the way in; and if you come you shall be admitted: for I know not whom I can see, that will bring more amusement on his tongue, or more kindness in his heart. I am, &amp;c.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;June 18, 1783.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">It gives me great pleasure to preserve such a memorial of Johnson&rsquo;s regard for Mr. Davies, to whom I was indebted for my introduction to him. He indeed loved Davies cordially, of which I shall give the following little evidence. One day when he had treated him with too much asperity, Tom, who was not without pride and spirit, went off in a passion; but he had hardly reached home when Frank, who had been sent after him, delivered this note:&mdash; &lsquo;Come, come, dear Davies, I am always sorry when we quarrel; send me word that we are friends.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Such was the general vigour of his constitution, that he recovered from this alarming and severe attack with wonderful quickness; so that in July he was able to make a visit to Mr. Langton at Rochester, where he passed about a fortnight, and made little excursions as easily as at any time of his life. In August he went as far as the neighbourhood of Salisbury, to Heale, the seat of William Bowles, Esq., a gentleman whom I have heard him praise for exemplary religious order in his family. In his diary I find a short but honourable mention of this visit:&mdash; &lsquo;August 28, I came to Heale without fatigue. 30, I am entertained quite to my mind.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">While he was here he had a letter from Dr. Brocklesby, acquainting him of the death of Mrs. Williams, which affected him a good deal. Though for several years her temper had not been complacent, she had valuable qualities, and her departure left a blank in his house. Upon this occasion he, according to his habitual course of piety, composed a prayer.</p>
<p class="p24">I shall here insert a few particulars concerning him, with which I have been favoured by one of his friends.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;He spoke often in praise of French literature. &ldquo;The French are excellent in this, (he would say,) they have a book on every subject.&rdquo; From what he had seen of them he denied them the praise of superiour politeness, and mentioned, with very visible disgust, the custom they have of spitting on the floors of their apartments. &ldquo;This, (said the Doctor), is as gross a thing as can well be done; and one wonders how any man, or set of men, can persist in so offensive a practice for a whole day together; one should expect that the first effort towards civilization would remove it even among savages.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Chymistry was always an interesting pursuit with Dr. Johnson. Whilst he was in Wiltshire, he attended some experiments that were made by a physician at Salisbury, on the new kinds of air. In the course of the experiments frequent mention being made of Dr. Priestley, Dr. Johnson knit his brows, and in a stern manner inquired, &ldquo;Why do we hear so much of Dr. Priestley?&rdquo; He was very properly answered, &ldquo;Sir, because we are indebted to him for these important discoveries.&rdquo; On this Dr. Johnson appeared well content; and replied, &ldquo;Well, well, I believe we are; and let every man have the honour he has merited.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;A friend was one day, about two years before his death, struck with some instance of Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s great candour. &ldquo;Well, Sir, (said he,) I will always say that you are a very candid man.&rdquo; &ldquo;Will you, (replied the Doctor,) I doubt then you will be very singular. But, indeed, Sir, (continued he,) I look upon myself to be a man very much misunderstood. I am not an uncandid, nor am I a severe man. I sometimes say more than I mean, in jest; and people are apt to believe me serious: however, I am more candid than I was when I was younger. As I know more of mankind I expect less of them, and am ready now to call a man A GOOD MAN, upon easier terms than I was formerly.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On his return from Heale he wrote to Dr. Burney: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I came home on the 18th at noon to a very disconsolate house. You and I have lost our friends; but you have more friends at home. My domestick companion is taken from me. She is much missed, for her acquisitions were many, and her curiosity universal; so that she partook of every conversation. I am not well enough to go much out; and to sit, and eat, or fast alone, is very wearisome. I always mean to send my compliments to all the ladies.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">His fortitude and patience met with severe trials during this year. The stroke of the palsy has been related circumstantially; but he was also afflicted with the gout, and was besides troubled with a complaint which not only was attended with immediate inconvenience, but threatened him with a chirurgical operation, from which most men would shrink. The complaint was a sarcocele, which Johnson bore with uncommon firmness, and was not at all frightened while he looked forward to amputation. He was attended by Mr. Pott and Mr. Cruikshank.</p>
<p class="p24">Happily the complaint abated without his being put to the torture of amputation. But we must surely admire the manly resolution which he discovered while it hung over him.</p>
<p class="p24">He this autumn received a visit from the celebrated Mrs. Siddons. He gives this account of it in one of his letters to Mrs. Thrale: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Mrs. Siddons, in her visit to me, behaved with great modesty and propriety, and left nothing behind her to be censured or despised. Neither praise nor money, the two powerful corrupters of mankind, seem to have depraved her. I shall be glad to see her again. Her brother Kemble calls on me, and pleases me very well. Mrs. Siddons and I talked of plays; and she told me her intention of exhibiting this winter the characters of Constance, Catharine, and Isabella, in Shakspeare.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Mr. Kemble has favoured me with the following minute of what passed at this visit: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;When Mrs. Siddons came into the room, there happened to be no chair ready for her, which he observing, said with a smile, &ldquo;Madam, you who so often occasion a want of seats to other people, will the more easily excuse the want of one yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Having placed himself by her, he with great good-humour entered upon a consideration of the English drama; and, among other inquiries, particularly asked her which of Shakspeare&rsquo;s characters she was most pleased with. Upon her answering that she thought the character of Queen Catharine, in Henry the Eighth, the most natural:&mdash; &ldquo;I think so too, Madam, (said he;) and whenever you perform it, I will once more hobble out to the theatre myself.&rdquo; Mrs. Siddons promised she would do herself the honour of acting his favourite part for him; but many circumstances happened to prevent the representation of King Henry the Eighth during the Doctor&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;In the course of the evening he thus gave his opinion upon the merits of some of the principal performers whom he remembered to have seen upon the stage. &ldquo;Mrs. Porter in the vehemence of rage, and Mrs. Clive in the sprightliness of humour, I have never seen equalled. What Clive did best, she did better than Garrick; but could not do half so many things well; she was a better romp than any I ever saw in nature. Pritchard, in common life, was a vulgar ideot; she would talk of her GOWND: but, when she appeared upon the stage, seemed to be inspired by gentility and understanding. I once talked with Colley Cibber, and thought him ignorant of the principles of his art. Garrick, Madam; was no declaimer; there was not one of his own scene-shifters who could not have spoken To be, or not to be, better than he did; yet he was the only actor I ever saw, whom I could call a master both in tragedy and comedy; though I liked him best in comedy. A true conception of character, and natural expression of it, were his distinguished excellencies.&rdquo; Having expatiated, with his usual force and eloquence, on Mr. Garrick&rsquo;s extraordinary eminence as an actor, he concluded with this compliment to his social talents: &ldquo;And after all, Madam, I thought him less to be envied on the stage than at the head of a table.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson, indeed, had thought more upon the subject of acting than might be generally supposed. Talking of it one day to Mr. Kemble, he said, &lsquo;Are you, Sir, one of those enthusiasts who believe yourself transformed into the very character you represent?&rsquo; Upon Mr. Kemble&rsquo;s answering that he had never felt so strong a persuasion himself; &lsquo;To be sure not, Sir, (said Johnson;) the thing is impossible. And if Garrick really believed himself to be that monster, Richard the Third, he deserved to be hanged every time he performed it.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I find in this, as in former years, notices of his kind attention to Mrs. Gardiner, who, though in the humble station of a tallow-chandler upon Snow-hill, was a woman of excellent good sense, pious, and charitable. She told me, she had been introduced to him by Mrs. Masters, the poetess, whose volumes he revised, and, it is said, illuminated here and there with a ray of his own genius. Mrs. Gardiner was very zealous for the support of the Ladies&rsquo; charity-school, in the parish of St. Sepulchre. It is confined to females; and, I am told, it afforded a hint for the story of Betty Broom in The Idler.</p>
<p class="p24">The late ingenious Mr. Mickle, some time before his death, wrote me a letter concerning Dr. Johnson, in which he mentions,&mdash; &lsquo;I was upwards of twelve years acquainted with him, was frequently in his company, always talked with ease to him, and can truly say, that I never received from him one rough word.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Mr. Mickle reminds me in this letter of a conversation, at dinner one day at Mr. Hoole&rsquo;s with Dr. Johnson, when Mr. Nicol the King&rsquo;s bookseller and I attempted to controvert the maxim, &lsquo;better that ten guilty should escape, than one innocent person suffer;&rsquo; and were answered by Dr. Johnson with great power of reasoning and eloquence. I am very sorry that I have no record of that day: but I well recollect my illustrious friend&rsquo;s having ably shewn, that unless civil institutions insure protection to the innocent, all the confidence which mankind should have in them would be lost.</p>
<p class="p24">Notwithstanding the complication of disorders under which Johnson now laboured, he did not resign himself to despondency and discontent, but with wisdom and spirit endeavoured to console and amuse his mind with as many innocent enjoyments as he could procure. Sir John Hawkins has mentioned the cordiality with which he insisted that such of the members of the old club in Ivy-lane as survived, should meet again and dine together, which they did, twice at a tavern and once at his house: and in order to insure himself society in the evening for three days in the week, he instituted a club at the Essex Head, in Essex-street, then kept by Samuel Greaves, an old servant of Mr. Thrale&rsquo;s.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;TO SIR JOSHUA REYNOLDS.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;DEAR SIR, &mdash; It is inconvenient to me to come out, I should else have waited on you with an account of a little evening Club which we are establishing in Essex-street, in the Strand, and of which you are desired to be one. It will be held at the Essex Head, now kept by an old servant of Thrale&rsquo;s. The company is numerous, and, as you will see by the list, miscellaneous. The terms are lax, and the expences light. Mr. Barry was adopted by Dr. Brocklesby, who joined with me in forming the plan. We meet thrice a week, and he who misses forfeits two-pence.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;If you are willing to become a member, draw a line under your name. Return the list. We meet for the first time on Monday at eight. I am, &amp;c.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Dec. 4, 1783.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">It did not suit Sir Joshua to be one of this Club. But when I mention only Mr. Daines Barrington, Dr. Brocklesby, Mr. Murphy, Mr. John Nichols, Mr. Cooke, Mr. Joddrel, Mr. Paradise, Dr. Horsley, Mr. Windham,* I shall sufficiently obviate the misrepresentation of it by Sir John Hawkins, as if it had been a low ale-house association, by which Johnson was degraded. Johnson himself, like his namesake Old Ben, composed the Rules of his Club.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* I was in Scotland when this Club was founded, and during</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all the winter.&nbsp; Johnson, however, declared I should be a</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;member, and invented a word upon the occasion: Boswell (said</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he,) is a very CLUBABLE man.&rsquo;&nbsp; When I came to town I was</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;proposed by Mr. Barrington, and chosen.&nbsp; I believe there are</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;few societies where there is better conversation or more</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;decorum, several of us resolved to continue it after our</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;great founder was removed by death.&nbsp; Other members were</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;added; and now, above eight years since that loss, we go on</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;happily. &mdash; BOSWELL.</p>
<p class="p24">In the end of this year he was seized with a spasmodick asthma of such violence, that he was confined to the house in great pain, being sometimes obliged to sit all night in his chair, a recumbent posture being so hurtful to his respiration, that he could not endure lying in bed; and there came upon him at the same time that oppressive and fatal disease, a dropsy. It was a very severe winter, which probably aggravated his complaints; and the solitude in which Mr. Levett and Mrs. Williams had left him, rendered his life very gloomy. Mrs. Desmoulins, who still lived, was herself so very ill, that she could contribute very little to his relief. He, however, had none of that unsocial shyness which we commonly see in people afflicted with sickness. He did not hide his head from the world, in solitary abstraction; he did not deny himself to the visits of his friends and acquaintances; but at all times, when he was not overcome by sleep, was ready for conversation as in his best days.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;TO MRS. LUCY PORTER, IN LICHFIELD.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;DEAR MADAM, &mdash; You may perhaps think me negligent that I have not written to you again upon the loss of your brother; but condolences and consolations are such common and such useless things, that the omission of them is no great crime: and my own diseases occupy my mind, and engage my care. My nights are miserably restless, and my days, therefore, are heavy. I try, however, to hold up my head as high as I can.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am sorry that your health is impaired; perhaps the spring and the summer may, in some degree, restore it: but if not, we must submit to the inconveniences of time, as to the other dispensations of Eternal Goodness. Pray for me, and write to me, or let Mr. Pearson write for you. I am, &amp;c.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;London, Nov. 29, 1783.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">1784: AETAT. 75.] &mdash; And now I am arrived at the last year of the life of SAMUEL JOHNSON, a year in which, although passed in severe indisposition, he nevertheless gave many evidences of the continuance of those wondrous powers of mind, which raised him so high in the intellectual world. His conversation and his letters of this year were in no respect inferiour to those of former years.</p>
<p class="p24">In consequence of Johnson&rsquo;s request that I should ask our physicians about his case, and desire Sir Alexander Dick to send his opinion, I transmitted him a letter from that very amiable Baronet, then in his eighty-first year, with his faculties as entire as ever; and mentioned his expressions to me in the note accompanying it: &lsquo;With my most affectionate wishes for Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s recovery, in which his friends, his country, and all mankind have so deep a stake:&rsquo; and at the same time a full opinion upon his case by Dr. Gillespie, who, like Dr. Cullen, had the advantage of having passed through the gradations of surgery and pharmacy, and by study and practice had attained to such skill, that my father settled on him two hundred pounds a year for five years, and fifty pounds a year during his life, as an honorarium to secure his particular attendance.</p>
<p class="p24">I also applied to three of the eminent physicians who had chairs in our celebrated school of medicine at Edinburgh, Doctors Cullen, Hope, and Monro.</p>
<p class="p24">All of them paid the most polite attention to my letter, and its venerable object. Dr. Cullen&rsquo;s words concerning him were, &lsquo;It would give me the greatest pleasure to be of any service to a man whom the publick properly esteem, and whom I esteem and respect as much as I do Dr. Johnson.&rsquo; Dr. Hope&rsquo;s, &lsquo;Few people have a better claim on me than your friend, as hardly a day passes that I do not ask his opinion about this or that word.&rsquo; Dr. Monro&rsquo;s, &lsquo;I most sincerely join you in sympathizing with that very worthy and ingenious character, from whom his country has derived much instruction and entertainment.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;TO THE REVEREND DR. TAYLOR, ASHBOURNE, DERBYSHIRE.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;DEAR SIR, &mdash; What can be the reason that I hear nothing from you? I hope nothing disables you from writing. What I have seen, and what I have felt, gives me reason to fear every thing. Do not omit giving me the comfort of knowing, that after all my losses I have yet a friend left.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I want every comfort. My life is very solitary and very cheerless. Though it has pleased GOD wonderfully to deliver me from the dropsy, I am yet very weak, and have not passed the door since the 13th of December. I hope for some help from warm weather, which will surely come in time.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I could not have the consent of the physicians to go to church yesterday; I therefore received the holy sacrament at home, in the room where I communicated with dear Mrs. Williams, a little before her death. O! my friend, the approach of death is very dreadful. I am afraid to think on that which I know I cannot avoid. It is vain to look round and round for that help which cannot be had. Yet we hope and hope, and fancy that he who has lived to-day may live to-morrow. But let us learn to derive our hope only from GOD.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;In the mean time, let us be kind to one another. I have no friend now living but you and Mr. Hector, that was the friend of my youth. Do not neglect, dear Sir, yours affectionately,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;London, Easter-Monday, April 12, 1784.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">What follows is a beautiful specimen of his gentleness and complacency to a young lady his god-child, one of the daughters of his friend Mr. Langton, then I think in her seventh year. He took the trouble to write it in a large round hand, nearly resembling printed characters, that she might have the satisfaction of reading it herself. The original lies before me, but shall be faithfully restored to her; and I dare say will be preserved by her as a jewel as long as she lives.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;TO MISS JANE LANGTON, IN ROCHESTER, KENT.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;MY DEAREST MISS JENNY, &mdash; I am sorry that your pretty letter has been so long without being answered; but, when I am not pretty well, I do not always write plain enough for young ladies. I am glad, my dear, to see that you write so well, and hope that you mind your pen, your book, and your needle, for they are all necessary. Your books will give you knowledge, and make you respected; and your needle will find you useful employment when you do not care to read. When you are a little older, I hope you will be very diligent in learning arithmetick, and, above all, that through your whole life you will carefully say your prayers, and read your Bible. I am, my dear, your most humble servant,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;May 10, 1784.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Wednesday, May 5, I arrived in London, and next morning had the pleasure to find Dr. Johnson greatly recovered. I but just saw him; for a coach was waiting to carry him to Islington, to the house of his friend the Reverend Mr. Strahan, where he went sometimes for the benefit of good air, which, notwithstanding his having formerly laughed at the general opinion upon the subject, he now acknowledged was conducive to health.</p>
<p class="p24">One morning afterwards, when I found him alone, he communicated to me, with solemn earnestness, a very remarkable circumstance which had happened in the course of his illness, when he was much distressed by the dropsy. He had shut himself up, and employed a day in particular exercises of religion &mdash; fasting, humiliation, and prayer. On a sudden he obtained extraordinary relief, for which he looked up to Heaven with grateful devotion. He made no direct inference from this fact; but from his manner of telling it, I could perceive that it appeared to him as something more than an incident in the common course of events. For my own part, I have no difficulty to avow that cast of thinking, which by many modern pretenders to wisdom is called SUPERSTITIOUS. But here I think even men of dry rationality may believe, that there was an intermediate interposition of Divine Providence, and that &lsquo;the fervent prayer of this righteous man&rsquo; availed.</p>
<p class="p24">On Saturday, May 15, I dined with him at Dr. Brocklesby&rsquo;s, where were Colonel Vallancy, Mr. Murphy, and that ever-cheerful companion Mr. Devaynes, apothecary to his Majesty. Of these days, and others on which I saw him, I have no memorials, except the general recollection of his being able and animated in conversation, and appearing to relish society as much as the youngest man. I find only these three small particulars: &mdash; When a person was mentioned, who said, &lsquo;I have lived fifty-one years in this world without having had ten minutes of uneasiness;&rsquo; he exclaimed, &lsquo;The man who says so, lies: he attempts to impose on human credulity.&rsquo; The Bishop of Exeter in vain observed, that men were very different. His Lordship&rsquo;s manner was not impressive, and I learnt afterwards that Johnson did not find out that the person who talked to him was a Prelate; if he had, I doubt not that he would have treated him with more respect; for once talking of George Psalmanazar, whom he reverenced for his piety, he said, &lsquo;I should as soon think of contradicting a BISHOP.&rsquo; One of the company* provoked him greatly by doing what he could least of all bear, which was quoting something of his own writing, against what he then maintained. &lsquo;What, Sir, (cried the gentleman,) do you say to</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;The busy day, the peaceful night,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfelt, uncounted, glided by?&rdquo;&rsquo; &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">Johnson finding himself thus presented as giving an instance of a man who had lived without uneasiness, was much offended, for he looked upon such a quotation as unfair. His anger burst out in an unjustifiable retort, insinuating that the gentleman&rsquo;s remark was a sally of ebriety; &lsquo;Sir, there is one passion I would advise you to command: when you have drunk out that glass, don&rsquo;t drink another.&rsquo; Here was exemplified what Goldsmith said of him, with the aid of a very witty image from one of Cibber&rsquo;s Comedies: &lsquo;There is no arguing with Johnson; for if his pistol misses fire, he knocks you down with the butt end of it.&rsquo; Another was this: when a gentleman of eminence in the literary world was violently censured for attacking people by anonymous paragraphs in news-papers; he, from the spirit of contradiction as I thought, took up his defence, and said, &lsquo;Come, come, this is not so terrible a crime; he means only to vex them a little. I do not say that I should do it; but there is a great difference between him and me; what is fit for Hephaestion is not fit for Alexander.&rsquo; Another, when I told him that a young and handsome Countess had said to me, &lsquo;I should think that to be praised by Dr. Johnson would make one a fool all one&rsquo;s life;&rsquo; and that I answered, &lsquo;Madam, I shall make him a fool to-day, by repeating this to him,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;I am too old to be made a fool; but if you say I am made a fool, I shall not deny it. I am much pleased with a compliment, especially from a pretty woman.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Boswell himself, likely enough. &mdash; HILL.</p>
<p class="p24">On the evening of Saturday, May 15, he was in fine spirits, at our Essex-Head Club. He told us, &lsquo;I dined yesterday at Mrs. Garrick&rsquo;s, with Mrs. Carter, Miss Hannah More, and Miss Fanny Burney. Three such women are not to be found: I know not where I could find a fourth, except Mrs. Lennox, who is superiour to them all.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;What! had you them all to yourself, Sir?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;I had them all as much as they were had; but it might have been better had there been more company there.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Might not Mrs. Montagu have been a fourth?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, Mrs. Montagu does not make a trade of her wit; but Mrs. Montagu is a very extraordinary woman; she has a constant stream of conversation, and it is always impregnated; it has always meaning.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Mr. Burke has a constant stream of conversation.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Yes, Sir; if a man were to go by chance at the same time with Burke under a shed, to shun a shower, he would say&mdash; &ldquo;this is an extraordinary man.&rdquo; If Burke should go into a stable to see his horse drest, the ostler would say&mdash; &ldquo;we have had an extraordinary man here.&rdquo;&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Foote was a man who never failed in conversation. If he had gone into a stable&mdash; &lsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, if he had gone into a stable, the ostler would have said, &ldquo;here has been a comical fellow&rdquo;; but he would not have respected him.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;And, Sir, the ostler would have answered him, would have given him as good as he brought, as the common saying is.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Yes, Sir; and Foote would have answered the ostler. &mdash; When Burke does not descend to be merry, his conversation is very superiour indeed. There is no proportion between the powers which he shews in serious talk and in jocularity. When he lets himself down to that, he is in the kennel.&rsquo; I have in another place opposed, and I hope with success, Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s very singular and erroneous notion as to Mr. Burke&rsquo;s pleasantry. Mr. Windham now said low to me, that he differed from our great friend in this observation; for that Mr. Burke was often very happy in his merriment. It would not have been right for either of us to have contradicted Johnson at this time, in a Society all of whom did not know and value Mr. Burke as much as we did. It might have occasioned something more rough, and at any rate would probably have checked the flow of Johnson&rsquo;s good-humour. He called to us with a sudden air of exultation, as the thought started into his mind, &lsquo;O! Gentlemen, I must tell you a very great thing. The Empress of Russia has ordered the Rambler to be translated into the Russian language: so I shall be read on the banks of the Wolga. Horace boasts that his fame would extend as far as the banks of the Rhone; now the Wolga is farther from me than the Rhone was from Horace.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;You must certainly be pleased with this, Sir.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;I am pleased, Sir, to be sure. A man is pleased to find he has succeeded in that which he has endeavoured to do.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">One of the company mentioned his having seen a noble person driving in his carriage, and looking exceedingly well, notwithstanding his great age. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Ah, Sir; that is nothing. Bacon observes, that a stout healthy old man is like a tower undermined.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Sunday, May 16, I found him alone; he talked of Mrs. Thrale with much concern, saying, &lsquo;Sir, she has done every thing wrong, since Thrale&rsquo;s bridle was off her neck;&rsquo; and was proceeding to mention some circumstances which have since been the subject of publick discussion, when he was interrupted by the arrival of Dr. Douglas, now Bishop of Salisbury.</p>
<p class="p24">In one of his little manuscript diaries, about this time, I find a short notice, which marks his amiable disposition more certainly than a thousand studied declarations.&mdash; &lsquo;Afternoon spent cheerfully and elegantly, I hope without offence to GOD or man; though in no holy duty, yet in the general exercise and cultivation of benevolence.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Monday, May 17, I dined with him at Mr. Dilly&rsquo;s, where were Colonel Vallancy, the Reverend Dr. Gibbons, and Mr. Capel Lofft, who, though a most zealous Whig, has a mind so full of learning and knowledge, and so much exercised in various departments, and withal so much liberality, that the stupendous powers of the literary Goliath, though they did not frighten this little David of popular spirit, could not but excite his admiration. There was also Mr. Braithwaite of the Post-office, that amiable and friendly man, who, with modest and unassuming manners, has associated with many of the wits of the age. Johnson was very quiescent to-day. Perhaps too I was indolent. I find nothing more of him in my notes, but that when I mentioned that I had seen in the King&rsquo;s library sixty-three editions of my favourite Thomas a Kempis, amongst which it was in eight languages, Latin, German, French, Italian, Spanish, English, Arabick, and Armenian, he said, he thought it unnecessary to collect many editions of a book, which were all the same, except as to the paper and print; he would have the original, and all the translations, and all the editions which had any variations in the text. He approved of the famous collection of editions of Horace by Douglas, mentioned by Pope, who is said to have had a closet filled with them; and he added, every man should try to collect one book in that manner, and present it to a publick library.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Wednesday, May 19, I sat a part of the evening with him, by ourselves. I observed, that the death of our friends might be a consolation against the fear of our own dissolution, because we might have more friends in the other world than in this. He perhaps felt this as a reflection upon his apprehension as to death; and said, with heat, &lsquo;How can a man know WHERE his departed friends are, or whether they will be his friends in the other world? How many friendships have you known formed upon principles of virtue? Most friendships are formed by caprice or by chance, mere confederacies in vice or leagues in folly.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">We talked of our worthy friend Mr. Langton. He said, &lsquo;I know not who will go to Heaven if Langton does not. Sir, I could almost say, Sit anima mea cum Langtono.&rsquo; I mentioned a very eminent friend as a virtuous man. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Yes, Sir; but &mdash;&mdash;&nbsp; &mdash; has not the evangelical virtue of Langton. &mdash;&mdash;&nbsp; &mdash; , I am afraid, would not scruple to pick up a wench.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He however charged Mr. Langton with what he thought want of judgment upon an interesting occasion. &lsquo;When I was ill, (said he,) I desired he would tell me sincerely in what he thought my life was faulty. Sir, he brought me a sheet of paper, on which he had written down several texts of Scripture, recommending christian charity. And when I questioned him what occasion I had given for such an animadversion, all that he could say amounted to this, &mdash; that I sometimes contradicted people in conversation. Now what harm does it do to any man to be contradicted?&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;I suppose he meant the MANNER of doing it; roughly, &mdash; and harshly.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;And who is the worse for that?&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;It hurts people of weak nerves.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;I know no such weak-nerved people.&rsquo; Mr. Burke, to whom I related this conference, said, &lsquo;It is well, if when a man comes to die, he has nothing heavier upon his conscience than having been a little rough in conversation.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson, at the time when the paper was presented to him, though at first pleased with the attention of his friend, whom he thanked in an earnest manner, soon exclaimed, in a loud and angry tone, &lsquo;What is your drift, Sir?&rsquo; Sir Joshua Reynolds pleasantly observed, that it was a scene for a comedy, to see a penitent get into a violent passion and belabour his confessor.</p>
<p class="p24">He had dined that day at Mr. Hoole&rsquo;s, and Miss Helen Maria Williams being expected in the evening, Mr. Hoole put into his hands her beautiful Ode on the Peace: Johnson read it over, and when this elegant and accomplished young lady was presented to him, he took her by the hand in the most courteous manner, and repeated the finest stanza of her poem; this was the most delicate and pleasing compliment he could pay. Her respectable friend, Dr. Kippis, from whom I had this anecdote, was standing by, and was not a little gratified.</p>
<p class="p24">Miss Williams told me, that the only other time she was fortunate enough to be in Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s company, he asked her to sit down by him, which she did, and upon her inquiring how he was, he answered, &lsquo;I am very ill indeed, Madam. I am very ill even when you are near me; what should I be were you at a distance?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He had now a great desire to go to Oxford, as his first jaunt after his illness; we talked of it for some days, and I had promised to accompany him. He was impatient and fretful to-night, because I did not at once agree to go with him on Thursday. When I considered how ill he had been, and what allowance should be made for the influence of sickness upon his temper, I resolved to indulge him, though with some inconvenience to myself, as I wished to attend the musical meeting in honour of Handel, in Westminster-Abbey, on the following Saturday.</p>
<p class="p24">In the midst of his own diseases and pains, he was ever compassionate to the distresses of others, and actively earnest in procuring them aid, as appears from a note to Sir Joshua Reynolds, of June, in these words:&mdash; &lsquo;I am ashamed to ask for some relief for a poor man, to whom, I hope, I have given what I can be expected to spare. The man importunes me, and the blow goes round. I am going to try another air on Thursday.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Thursday, June 3, the Oxford post-coach took us up in the morning at Bolt-court. The other two passengers were Mrs. Beresford and her daughter, two very agreeable ladies from America; they were going to Worcestershire, where they then resided. Frank had been sent by his master the day before to take places for us; and I found, from the waybill, that Dr. Johnson had made our names be put down. Mrs. Beresford, who had read it, whispered me, &lsquo;Is this the great Dr. Johnson?&rsquo; I told her it was; so she was then prepared to listen. As she soon happened to mention in a voice so low that Johnson did not hear it, that her husband had been a member of the American Congress, I cautioned her to beware of introducing that subject, as she must know how very violent Johnson was against the people of that country. He talked a great deal, but I am sorry I have preserved little of the conversation. Miss Beresford was so much charmed, that she said to me aside, &lsquo;How he does talk! Every sentence is an essay.&rsquo; She amused herself in the coach with knotting; he would scarcely allow this species of employment any merit. &lsquo;Next to mere idleness (said he,) I think knotting is to be reckoned in the scale of insignificance; though I once attempted to learn knotting. Dempster&rsquo;s sister (looking to me,) endeavoured to teach me it; but I made no progress.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I was surprised at his talking without reserve in the publick post-coach of the state of his affairs; &lsquo;I have (said he,) about the world I think above a thousand pounds, which I intend shall afford Frank an annuity of seventy pounds a year.&rsquo; Indeed his openness with people at a first interview was remarkable. He said once to Mr. Langton, &lsquo;I think I am like Squire Richard in The Journey to London, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m never strange in a strange place.&rdquo;&rsquo; He was truly SOCIAL. He strongly censured what is much too common in England among persons of condition, &mdash; maintaining an absolute silence, when unknown to each other; as for instance, when occasionally brought together in a room before the master or mistress of the house has appeared. &lsquo;Sir, that is being so uncivilised as not to understand the common rights of humanity.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">At the inn where we stopped he was exceedingly dissatisfied with some roast mutton which we had for dinner. The ladies I saw wondered to see the great philosopher, whose wisdom and wit they had been admiring all the way, get into ill-humour from such a cause. He scolded the waiter, saying, &lsquo;It is as bad as bad can be: it is ill-fed, ill-killed, ill-kept, and ill-drest.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He bore the journey very well, and seemed to feel himself elevated as he approached Oxford, that magnificent and venerable seat of learning, Orthodoxy, and Toryism. Frank came in the heavy coach, in readiness to attend him; and we were received with the most polite hospitality at the house of his old friend Dr. Adams, Master of Pembroke College, who had given us a kind invitation. Before we were set down, I communicated to Johnson, my having engaged to return to London directly, for the reason I have mentioned, but that I would hasten back to him again. He was pleased that I had made this journey merely to keep him company. He was easy and placid with Dr. Adams, Mrs. and Miss Adams, and Mrs. Kennicot, widow of the learned Hebraean, who was here on a visit. He soon dispatched the inquiries which were made about his illness and recovery, by a short and distinct narrative; and then assuming a gay air, repeated from Swift, &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Nor think on our approaching ills,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And talk of spectacles and pills.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I fulfilled my intention by going to London, and returned to Oxford on Wednesday the 9th of June, when I was happy to find myself again in the same agreeable circle at Pembroke College, with the comfortable prospect of making some stay. Johnson welcomed my return with more than ordinary glee.</p>
<p class="p24">Next morning at breakfast, he pointed out a passage in Savage&rsquo;s Wanderer, saying, &lsquo;These are fine verses.&rsquo; &lsquo;If (said he,) I had written with hostility of Warburton in my Shakspeare, I should have quoted this couplet: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Here Learning, blinded first and then beguil&rsquo;d,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looks dark as Ignorance, as Fancy wild.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">You see they&rsquo;d have fitted him to a T,&rsquo; (smiling.) Dr. ADAMS. &lsquo;But you did not write against Warburton.&rsquo; JOHNSON. No, Sir, I treated him with great respect both in my Preface and in my Notes.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">After dinner, when one of us talked of there being a great enmity between Whig and Tory; &mdash; Johnson. &lsquo;Why not so much, I think, unless when they come into competition with each other. There is none when they are only common acquaintance, none when they are of different sexes. A Tory will marry into a Whig family, and a Whig into a Tory family, without any reluctance. But indeed, in a matter of much more concern than political tenets, and that is religion, men and women do not concern themselves much about difference of opinion; and ladies set no value on the moral character of men who pay their addresses to them; the greatest profligate will be as well received as the man of the greatest virtue, and this by a very good woman, by a woman who says her prayers three times a day.&rsquo; Our ladies endeavoured to defend their sex from this charge; but he roared them down! &lsquo;No, no, a lady will take Jonathan Wild as readily as St. Austin, if he has threepence more; and, what is worse, her parents will give her to him. Women have a perpetual envy of our vices; they are less vicious than we, not from choice, but because we restrict them; they are the slaves of order and fashion; their virtue is of more consequence to us than our own, so far as concerns this world.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Miss Adams mentioned a gentleman of licentious character, and said, &lsquo;Suppose I had a mind to marry that gentleman, would my parents consent?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Yes, they&rsquo;d consent, and you&rsquo;d go. You&rsquo;d go though they did not consent.&rsquo; Miss ADAMS. &lsquo;Perhaps their opposing might make me go.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;O, very well; you&rsquo;d take one whom you think a bad man, to have the pleasure of vexing your parents. You put me in mind of Dr. Barrowby, the physician, who was very fond of swine&rsquo;s flesh. One day, when he was eating it, he said, &ldquo;I wish I was a Jew.&rdquo; &ldquo;Why so? (said somebody;) the Jews are not allowed to eat your favourite meat.&rdquo; &ldquo;Because, (said he,) I should then have the gust of eating it, with the pleasure of sinning.&rdquo;&rsquo; Johnson then proceeded in his declamation.</p>
<p class="p24">Miss Adams soon afterwards made an observation that I do not recollect, which pleased him much: he said with a good-humoured smile, &lsquo;That there should be so much excellence united with so much DEPRAVITY, is strange.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Indeed, this lady&rsquo;s good qualities, merit, and accomplishments, and her constant attention to Dr. Johnson, were not lost upon him. She happened to tell him that a little coffeepot, in which she had made his coffee, was the only thing she could call her own. He turned to her with a complacent gallantry, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t say so, my dear; I hope you don&rsquo;t reckon my heart as nothing.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Friday, June 11, we talked at breakfast, of forms of prayer. JOHNSON. &lsquo;I know of no good prayers but those in the Book of Common Prayer.&rsquo; DR. ADAMS. (in a very earnest manner:) &lsquo;I wish, Sir, you would compose some family prayers.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;I will not compose prayers for you, Sir, because you can do it for yourself. But I have thought of getting together all the books of prayers which I could, selecting those which should appear to me the best, putting out some, inserting others, adding some prayers of my own, and prefixing a discourse on prayer.&rsquo; We all now gathered about him, and two or three of us at a time joined in pressing him to execute this plan. He seemed to be a little displeased at the manner of our importunity, and in great agitation called out, &lsquo;Do not talk thus of what is so aweful. I know not what time GOD will allow me in this world. There are many things which I wish to do.&rsquo; Some of us persisted, and Dr. Adams said, &lsquo;I never was more serious about any thing in my life.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Let me alone, let me alone; I am overpowered.&rsquo; And then he put his hands before his face, and reclined for some time upon the table.</p>
<p class="p24">Dr. Johnson and I went in Dr. Adams&rsquo;s coach to dine with Dr. Nowell, Principal of St. Mary Hall, at his beautiful villa at Iffley, on the banks of the Isis, about two miles from Oxford. While we were upon the road, I had the resolution to ask Johnson whether he thought that the roughness of his manner had been an advantage or not, and if he would not have done more good if he had been more gentle. I proceeded to answer myself thus: &lsquo;Perhaps it has been of advantage, as it has given weight to what you said: you could not, perhaps, have talked with such authority without it.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;No, Sir; I have done more good as I am. Obscenity and Impiety have always been repressed in my company.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;True, Sir; and that is more than can be said of every Bishop. Greater liberties have been taken in the presence of a Bishop, though a very good man, from his being milder, and therefore not commanding such awe. Yet, Sir, many people who might have been benefited by your conversation, have been frightened away. A worthy friend of ours has told me, that he has often been afraid to talk to you.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, he need not have been afraid, if he had any thing rational to say. If he had not, it was better he did not talk.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">We talked of a certain clergyman of extraordinary character, who by exerting his talents in writing on temporary topicks, and displaying uncommon intrepidity, had raised himself to affluence. I maintained that we ought not to be indignant at his success; for merit of every sort was entitled to reward. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, I will not allow this man to have merit. No, Sir; what he has is rather the contrary; I will, indeed, allow him courage, and on this account we so far give him credit. We have more respect for a man who robs boldly on the highway, than for a fellow who jumps out of a ditch, and knocks you down behind your back. Courage is a quality so necessary for maintaining virtue, that it is always respected, even when it is associated with vice.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Mr. Henderson, with whom I had sauntered in the venerable walks of Merton College, and found him a very learned and pious man, supped with us. Dr. Johnson surprised him not a little, by acknowledging with a look of horrour, that he was much oppressed by the fear of death. The amiable Dr. Adams suggested that GOD was infinitely good. JOHNSON. &lsquo;That he is infinitely good, as far as the perfection of his nature will allow, I certainly believe; but it is necessary for good upon the whole, that individuals should be punished. As to an INDIVIDUAL, therefore, he is not infinitely good; and as I cannot be SURE that I have fulfilled the conditions on which salvation is granted, I am afraid I may be one of those who shall be damned.&rsquo; (looking dismally). DR. ADAMS. &lsquo;What do you mean by damned?&rsquo; JOHNSON. (passionately and loudly,) &lsquo;Sent to Hell, Sir, and punished everlastingly!&rsquo; DR. ADAMS. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t believe that doctrine.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Hold, Sir, do you believe that some will be punished at all?&rsquo; DR. ADAMS. &lsquo;Being excluded from Heaven will be a punishment; yet there may be no great positive suffering.&rsquo; JOHNSON. Well, Sir; but, if you admit any degree of punishment, there is an end of your argument for infinite goodness simply considered; for, infinite goodness would inflict no punishment whatever. There is not infinite goodness physically considered; morally there is.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;But may not a man attain to such a degree of hope as not to be uneasy from the fear of death?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;A man may have such a degree of hope as to keep him quiet. You see I am not quiet, from the vehemence with which I talk; but I do not despair.&rsquo; MRS. ADAMS. &lsquo;You seem, Sir, to forget the merits of our Redeemer.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Madam, I do not forget the merits of my Redeemer; but my Redeemer has said that he will set some on his right hand and some on his left.&rsquo; He was in gloomy agitation, and said, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll have no more on&rsquo;t.&rsquo; If what has now been stated should be urged by the enemies of Christianity, as if its influence on the mind were not benignant, let it be remembered, that Johnson&rsquo;s temperament was melancholy, of which such direful apprehensions of futurity are often a common effect. We shall presently see that when he approached nearer to his aweful change, his mind became tranquil, and he exhibited as much fortitude as becomes a thinking man in that situation.</p>
<p class="p24">From the subject of death we passed to discourse of life, whether it was upon the whole more happy or miserable. Johnson was decidedly for the balance of misery: in confirmation of which I maintained, that no man would choose to lead over again the life which he had experienced. Johnson acceded to that opinion in the strongest terms.</p>
<p class="p24">On Sunday, June 13, our philosopher was calm at breakfast. There was something exceedingly pleasing in our leading a College life, without restraint, and with superiour elegance, in consequence of our living in the Master&rsquo;s house, and having the company of ladies. Mrs. Kennicot related, in his presence, a lively saying of Dr. Johnson to Miss Hannah More, who had expressed a wonder that the poet who had written Paradise Lost should write such poor Sonnets:&mdash; &lsquo;Milton, Madam, was a genius that could cut a Colossus from a rock; but could not carve heads upon cherry-stones.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Monday, June 14, and Tuesday, 15, Dr. Johnson and I dined, on one of them, I forget which, with Mr. Mickle, translator of the Lusiad, at Wheatley, a very pretty country place a few miles from Oxford; and on the other with Dr. Wetherell, Master of University College. From Dr. Wetherell&rsquo;s he went to visit Mr. Sackville Parker, the bookseller; and when he returned to us, gave the following account of his visit, saying, &lsquo;I have been to see my old friend, Sack Parker; I find he has married his maid; he has done right. She had lived with him many years in great confidence, and they had mingled minds; I do not think he could have found any wife that would have made him so happy. The woman was very attentive and civil to me; she pressed me to fix a day for dining with them, and to say what I liked, and she would be sure to get it for me. Poor Sack! He is very ill, indeed. We parted as never to meet again. It has quite broke me down.&rsquo; This pathetic narrative was strangely diversified with the grave and earnest defence of a man&rsquo;s having married his maid. I could not but feel it as in some degree ludicrous.</p>
<p class="p24">In the morning of Tuesday, June 15, while we sat at Dr. Adams&rsquo;s, we talked of a printed letter from the Reverend Herbert Croft, to a young gentleman who had been his pupil, in which he advised him to read to the end of whatever books he should begin to read. JOHNSON. &lsquo;This is surely a strange advice; you may as well resolve that whatever men you happen to get acquainted with, you are to keep to them for life. A book may be good for nothing; or there may be only one thing in it worth knowing; are we to read it all through? These Voyages, (pointing to the three large volumes of Voyages to the South Sea, which were just come out) WHO will read them through? A man had better work his way before the mast, than read them through; they will be eaten by rats and mice, before they are read through. There can be little entertainment in such books; one set of Savages is like another.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;I do not think the people of Otaheite can be reckoned Savages.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t cant in defence of Savages.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;They have the art of navigation.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;A dog or a cat can swim.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;They carve very ingeniously.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;A cat can scratch, and a child with a nail can scratch.&rsquo; I perceived this was none of the mollia tempora fandi; so desisted.</p>
<p class="p24">Upon his mentioning that when he came to College he wrote his first exercise twice over; but never did so afterwards; MISS ADAMS. &lsquo;I suppose, Sir, you could not make them better?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Yes, Madam, to be sure, I could make them better. Thought is better than no thought.&rsquo; MISS ADAMS. &lsquo;Do you think, Sir, you could make your Ramblers better?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Certainly I could.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll lay a bet, Sir, you cannot.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;But I will, Sir, if I choose. I shall make the best of them you shall pick out, better.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;But you may add to them. I will not allow of that.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Nay, Sir, there are three ways of making them better; &mdash; putting out, &mdash; adding, &mdash; or correcting.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">During our visit at Oxford, the following conversation passed between him and me on the subject of my trying my fortune at the English bar: Having asked whether a very extensive acquaintance in London, which was very valuable, and of great advantage to a man at large, might not be prejudicial to a lawyer, by preventing him from giving sufficient attention to his business; &mdash; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, you will attend to business, as business lays hold of you. When not actually employed, you may see your friends as much as you do now. You may dine at a Club every day, and sup with one of the members every night; and you may be as much at publick places as one who has seen them all would wish to be. But you must take care to attend constantly in Westminster-Hall; both to mind your business, as it is almost all learnt there, (for nobody reads now;) and to shew that you want to have business. And you must not be too often seen at publick places, that competitors may not have it to say, &ldquo;He is always at the Playhouse or at Ranelagh, and never to be found at his chambers.&rdquo; And, Sir, there must be a kind of solemnity in the manner of a professional man. I have nothing particular to say to you on the subject. All this I should say to any one; I should have said it to Lord Thurlow twenty years ago.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Wednesday, June 19, Dr. Johnson and I returned to London; he was not well to-day, and said very little, employing himself chiefly in reading Euripides. He expressed some displeasure at me, for not observing sufficiently the various objects upon the road. &lsquo;If I had your eyes, Sir, (said he,) I should count the passengers.&rsquo; It was wonderful how accurate his observation of visual objects was, notwithstanding his imperfect eyesight, owing to a habit of attention. That he was much satisfied with the respect paid to him at Dr. Adams&rsquo;s is thus attested by himself: &lsquo;I returned last night from Oxford, after a fortnight&rsquo;s abode with Dr. Adams, who treated me as well as I could expect or wish; and he that contents a sick man, a man whom it is impossible to please, has surely done his part well.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">After his return to London from this excursion, I saw him frequently, but have few memorandums: I shall therefore here insert some particulars which I collected at various times.</p>
<p class="p24">It having been mentioned to Dr. Johnson that a gentleman who had a son whom he imagined to have an extreme degree of timidity, resolved to send him to a publick school, that he might acquire confidence;&mdash; &lsquo;Sir, (said Johnson,) this is a preposterous expedient for removing his infirmity; such a disposition should be cultivated in the shade. Placing him at a publick school is forcing an owl upon day.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Speaking of a gentleman whose house was much frequented by low company; &lsquo;Rags, Sir, (said he,) will always make their appearance where they have a right to do it.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Of the same gentleman&rsquo;s mode of living, he said, &lsquo;Sir, the servants, instead of doing what they are bid, stand round the table in idle clusters, gaping upon the guests; and seem as unfit to attend a company, as to steer a man of war.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">A dull country magistrate gave Johnson a long tedious account of his exercising his criminal jurisdiction, the result of which was his having sentenced four convicts to transportation. Johnson, in an agony of impatience to get rid of such a companion, exclaimed, &lsquo;I heartily wish, Sir, that I were a fifth.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson was present when a tragedy was read, in which there occurred this line: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Who rules o&rsquo;er freemen should himself be free.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">The company having admired it much, &lsquo;I cannot agree with you (said Johnson). It might as well be said, &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Who drives fat oxen should himself be fat.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson having argued for some time with a pertinacious gentleman; his opponent, who had talked in a very puzzling manner, happened to say, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t understand you, Sir:&rsquo; upon which Johnson observed, &lsquo;Sir, I have found you an argument; but I am not obliged to find you an understanding.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Talking to me of Horry Walpole, (as Horace late Earl of Orford was often called,) Johnson allowed that he got together a great many curious little things, and told them in an elegant manner. Mr. Walpole thought Johnson a more amiable character after reading his Letters to Mrs. Thrale: but never was one of the true admirers of that great man. We may suppose a prejudice conceived, if he ever heard Johnson&rsquo;s account to Sir George Staunton, that when he made the speeches in parliament for the Gentleman&rsquo;s Magazine, &lsquo;he always took care to put Sir Robert Walpole in the wrong, and to say every thing he could against the electorate of Hanover.&rsquo; The celebrated Heroick Epistle, in which Johnson is satyrically introduced, has been ascribed both to Mr. Walpole and Mr. Mason. One day at Mr. Courtenay&rsquo;s, when a gentleman expressed his opinion that there was more energy in that poem than could be expected from Mr. Walpole; Mr. Warton, the late Laureat, observed, &lsquo;It may have been written by Walpole, and BUCKRAM&rsquo;D by Mason.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Sir Joshua Reynolds having said that he took the altitude of a man&rsquo;s taste by his stories and his wit, and of his understanding by the remarks which he repeated; being always sure that he must be a weak man who quotes common things with an emphasis as if they were oracles; Johnson agreed with him; and Sir Joshua having also observed that the real character of a man was found out by his amusements, &mdash; Johnson added, &lsquo;Yes, Sir; no man is a hypocrite in his pleasures.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I have mentioned Johnson&rsquo;s general aversion to a pun. He once, however, endured one of mine. When we were talking of a numerous company in which he had distinguished himself highly, I said, &lsquo;Sir, you were a COD surrounded by smelts. Is not this enough for you? at a time too when you were not FISHING for a compliment?&rsquo; He laughed at this with a complacent approbation. Old Mr. Sheridan observed, upon my mentioning it to him, &lsquo;He liked your compliment so well, he was willing to take it with PUN SAUCE.&rsquo; For my own part, I think no innocent species of wit or pleasantry should be suppressed; and that a good pun may be admitted among the smaller excellencies of lively conversation.</p>
<p class="p24">Mr. Burke uniformly shewed Johnson the greatest respect; and when Mr. Townshend, now Lord Sydney, at a period when he was conspicuous in opposition, threw out some reflection in parliament upon the grant of a pension to a man of such political principles as Johnson; Mr. Burke, though then of the same party with Mr. Townshend, stood warmly forth in defence of his friend, to whom, he justly observed, the pension was granted solely on account of his eminent literary merit. I am well assured, that Mr. Townshend&rsquo;s attack upon Johnson was the occasion of his &lsquo;hitching in a rhyme;&rsquo; for, that in the original copy of Goldsmith&rsquo;s character of Mr. Burke, in his Retaliation, another person&rsquo;s name stood in the couplet where Mr. Townshend is now introduced: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Though fraught with all learning kept straining his throat,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To persuade Tommy Townshend to lend him a vote.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">It may be worth remarking, among the minutiae of my collection, that Johnson was once drawn to serve in the militia, the Trained Bands of the City of London, and that Mr. Rackstrow, of the Museum in Fleet-street, was his Colonel. It may be believed he did not serve in person; but the idea, with all its circumstances, is certainly laughable. He upon that occasion provided himself with a musket, and with a sword and belt, which I have seen hanging in his closet.</p>
<p class="p24">An authour of most anxious and restless vanity being mentioned, &lsquo;Sir, (said he,) there is not a young sapling upon Parnassus more severely blown about by every wind of criticism than that poor fellow.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">The difference, he observed, between a well-bred and an ill-bred man is this: &lsquo;One immediately attracts your liking, the other your aversion. You love the one till you find reason to hate him; you hate the other till you find reason to love him.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">A foppish physician once reminded Johnson of his having been in company with him on a former occasion; &lsquo;I do not remember it, Sir.&rsquo; The physician still insisted; adding that he that day wore so fine a coat that it must have attracted his notice. &lsquo;Sir, (said Johnson,) had you been dipt in Pactolus I should not have noticed you.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He seemed to take a pleasure in speaking in his own style; for when he had carelessly missed it, he would repeat the thought translated into it. Talking of the Comedy of The Rehearsal, he said, &lsquo;It has not wit enough to keep it sweet.&rsquo; This was easy; he therefore caught himself, and pronounced a more round sentence; &lsquo;It has not vitality enough to preserve it from putrefaction.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Though he had no taste for painting, he admired much the manner in which Sir Joshua Reynolds treated of his art, in his Discourses to the Royal Academy. He observed one day of a passage in them, &lsquo;I think I might as well have said this myself:&rsquo; and once when Mr. Langton was sitting by him, he read one of them very eagerly, and expressed himself thus:&mdash; &lsquo;Very well, Master Reynolds; very well, indeed. But it will not be understood.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">When I observed to him that Painting was so far inferiour to Poetry, that the story or even emblem which it communicates must be previously known, and mentioned as a natural and laughable instance of this, that a little Miss on seeing a picture of Justice with the scales, had exclaimed to me, &lsquo;See, there&rsquo;s a woman selling sweetmeats;&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;Painting, Sir, can illustrate, but cannot inform.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">No man was more ready to make an apology when he had censured unjustly, than Johnson. When a proof-sheet of one of his works was brought to him, he found fault with the mode in which a part of it was arranged, refused to read it, and in a passion desired that the compositor might be sent to him. The compositor was Mr. Manning, a decent sensible man, who had composed about one half of his Dictionary, when in Mr. Strahan&rsquo;s printing-house; and a great part of his Lives of the Poets, when in that of Mr. Nichols; and who (in his seventy-seventh year), when in Mr. Baldwin&rsquo;s printing-house, composed a part of the first edition of this work concerning him. By producing the manuscript, he at once satisfied Dr. Johnson that he was not to blame. Upon which Johnson candidly and earnestly said to him, &lsquo;Mr. Compositor, I ask your pardon. Mr. Compositor, I ask your pardon, again and again.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">His generous humanity to the miserable was almost beyond example. The following instance is well attested: &mdash; Coming home late one night, he found a poor woman lying in the street, so much exhausted that she could not walk; he took her upon his back, and carried her to his house, where he discovered that she was one of those wretched females who had fallen into the lowest state of vice, poverty, and disease. Instead of harshly upbraiding her, he had her taken care of with all tenderness for a long time, at considerable expence, till she was restored to health, and endeavoured to put her into a virtuous way of living.</p>
<p class="p24">He once in his life was known to have uttered what is called a BULL: Sir Joshua Reynolds, when they were riding together in Devonshire, complained that he had a very bad horse, for that even when going down hill he moved slowly step by step. &lsquo;Ay (said Johnson,) and when he goes up hill, he STANDS STILL.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He had a great aversion to gesticulating in company. He called once to a gentleman who offended him in that point, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t ATTITUDENISE.&rsquo; And when another gentleman thought he was giving additional force to what he uttered, by expressive movements of his hands, Johnson fairly seized them, and held them down.</p>
<p class="p24">Mr. Steevens, who passed many a social hour with him during their long acquaintance, which commenced when they both lived in the Temple, has preserved a good number of particulars concerning him, most of which are to be found in the department of Apothegms, &amp;c. in the Collection of Johnson&rsquo;s Works. But he has been pleased to favour me with the following, which are original: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Dr. Johnson once assumed a character in which perhaps even Mr. Boswell never saw him. His curiosity having been excited by the praises bestowed on the celebrated Torre&rsquo;s fireworks at Marybone-Gardens, he desired Mr. Steevens to accompany him thither. The evening had proved showery; and soon after the few people present were assembled, publick notice was given, that the conductors to the wheels, suns, stars, &amp;c., were so thoroughly water-soaked, that it was impossible any part of the exhibition should be made. &ldquo;This is a mere excuse, (says the Doctor,) to save their crackers for a more profitable company. Let us but hold up our sticks, and threaten to break those coloured lamps that surround the Orchestra, and we shall soon have our wishes gratified. The core of the fireworks cannot be injured; let the different pieces be touched in their respective centers, and they will do their offices as well as ever.&rdquo; Some young men who overheard him, immediately began the violence he had recommended, and an attempt was speedily made to fire some of the wheels which appeared to have received the smallest damage; but to little purpose were they lighted, for most of them completely failed. The authour of The Rambler, however, may be considered, on this occasion, as the ringleader of a successful riot, though not as a skilful pyrotechnist.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;It has been supposed that Dr. Johnson, so far as fashion was concerned, was careless of his appearance in publick. But this is not altogether true, as the following slight instance may show: &mdash; Goldsmith&rsquo;s last Comedy was to be represented during some court-mourning: and Mr. Steevens appointed to call on Dr. Johnson, and carry him to the tavern where he was to dine with others of the Poet&rsquo;s friends. The Doctor was ready dressed, but in coloured cloaths; yet being told that he would find every one else in black, received the intelligence with a profusion of thanks, hastened to change his attire, all the while repeating his gratitude for the information that had saved him from an appearance so improper in the front row of a front box. &ldquo;I would not (added he,) for ten pounds, have seemed so retrograde to any general observance.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;He would sometimes found his dislikes on very slender circumstances. Happening one day to mention Mr. Flexman, a Dissenting Minister, with some compliment to his exact memory in chronological matters; the Doctor replied, &ldquo;Let me hear no more of him, Sir. That is the fellow who made the Index to my Ramblers, and set down the name of Milton thus: Milton, MR. John.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">In the course of this work a numerous variety of names has been mentioned, to which many might be added. I cannot omit Lord and Lady Lucan, at whose house he often enjoyed all that an elegant table and the best company can contribute to happiness; he found hospitality united with extraordinary accomplishments, and embellished with charms of which no man could be insensible.</p>
<p class="p24">On Tuesday, June 22, I dined with him at THE LITERARY CLUB, the last time of his being in that respectable society. The other members present were the Bishop of St. Asaph, Lord Eliot, Lord Palmerston, Dr. Fordyce, and Mr. Malone. He looked ill; but had such a manly fortitude, that he did not trouble the company with melancholy complaints. They all shewed evident marks of kind concern about him, with which he was much pleased, and he exerted himself to be as entertaining as his indisposition allowed him.</p>
<p class="p24">The anxiety of his friends to preserve so estimable a life, as long as human means might be supposed to have influence, made them plan for him a retreat from the severity of a British winter, to the mild climate of Italy. This scheme was at last brought to a serious resolution at General Paoli&rsquo;s, where I had often talked of it. One essential matter, however, I understood was necessary to be previously settled, which was obtaining such an addition to his income, as would be sufficient to enable him to defray the expence in a manner becoming the first literary character of a great nation, and independent of all his other merits, the Authour of THE DICTIONARY OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE. The person to whom I above all others thought I should apply to negociate this business, was the Lord Chancellor, because I knew that he highly valued Johnson, and that Johnson highly valued his Lordship; so that it was no degradation of my illustrious friend to solicit for him the favour of such a man. I have mentioned what Johnson said of him to me when he was at the bar; and after his Lordship was advanced to the seals, he said of him, &lsquo;I would prepare myself for no man in England but Lord Thurlow. When I am to meet with him I should wish to know a day before.&rsquo; How he would have prepared himself I cannot conjecture. Would he have selected certain topicks, and considered them in every view so as to be in readiness to argue them at all points? and what may we suppose those topicks to have been? I once started the curious inquiry to the great man who was the subject of this compliment: he smiled, but did not pursue it.</p>
<p class="p24">I first consulted with Sir Joshua Reynolds, who perfectly coincided in opinion with me; and I therefore, though personally very little known to his Lordship, wrote to him, stating the case, and requesting his good offices for Dr. Johnson. I mentioned that I was obliged to set out for Scotland early in the following week, so that if his Lordship should have any commands for me as to this pious negociation, he would be pleased to send them before that time; otherwise Sir Joshua Reynolds would give all attention to it.</p>
<p class="p24">This application was made not only without any suggestion on the part of Johnson himself, but was utterly unknown to him, nor had he the smallest suspicion of it. Any insinuations, therefore, which since his death have been thrown out, as if he had stooped to ask what was superfluous, are without any foundation. But, had he asked it, it would not have been superfluous; for though the money he had saved proved to be more than his friends imagined, or than I believe he himself, in his carelessness concerning worldly matters, knew it to be, had he travelled upon the Continent, an augmentation of his income would by no means have been unnecessary.</p>
<p class="p24">On Thursday, June 24, I dined with him at Mr. Dilly&rsquo;s, where were the Rev. Mr. (now Dr.) Knox, master of Tunbridge-school, Mr. Smith, Vicar of Southill, Dr. Beattie, Mr. Pinkerton, authour of various literary performances, and the Rev. Dr. Mayo. At my desire old Mr. Sheridan was invited, as I was earnest to have Johnson and him brought together again by chance, that a reconciliation might be effected. Mr. Sheridan happened to come early, and having learned that Dr. Johnson was to be there, went away; so I found, with sincere regret, that my friendly intentions were hopeless. I recollect nothing that passed this day, except Johnson&rsquo;s quickness, who, when Dr. Beattie observed, as something remarkable which had happened to him, that he had chanced to see both No. 1, and No. 1000, of the hackney-coaches, the first and the last; &lsquo;Why, Sir, (said Johnson,) there is an equal chance for one&rsquo;s seeing those two numbers as any other two.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Friday, June 25, I dined with him at General Paoli&rsquo;s, where, he says in one of his letters to Mrs. Thrale, &lsquo;I love to dine.&rsquo; There was a variety of dishes much to his taste, of all which he seemed to me to eat so much, that I was afraid he might be hurt by it; and I whispered to the General my fear, and begged he might not press him. &lsquo;Alas! (said the General,) see how very ill he looks; he can live but a very short time. Would you refuse any slight gratifications to a man under sentence of death? There is a humane custom in Italy, by which persons in that melancholy situation are indulged with having whatever they like best to eat and drink, even with expensive delicacies.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Sunday, June 27, I found him rather better. I mentioned to him a young man who was going to Jamaica with his wife and children, in expectation of being provided for by two of her brothers settled in that island, one a clergyman, and the other a physician. JOHNSON. &lsquo;It is a wild scheme, Sir, unless he has a positive and deliberate invitation. There was a poor girl, who used to come about me, who had a cousin in Barbadoes, that, in a letter to her, expressed a wish she should come out to that Island, and expatiated on the comforts and happiness of her situation. The poor girl went out: her cousin was much surprised, and asked her how she could think of coming. &ldquo;Because, (said she,) you invited me.&rdquo; &ldquo;Not I,&rdquo; answered the cousin. The letter was then produced. &ldquo;I see it is true, (said she,) that I did invite you: but I did not think you would come.&rdquo; They lodged her in an out-house, where she passed her time miserably; and as soon as she had an opportunity she returned to England. Always tell this, when you hear of people going abroad to relations, upon a notion of being well received. In the case which you mention, it is probable the clergyman spends all he gets, and the physician does not know how much he is to get.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">We this day dined at Sir Joshua Reynolds&rsquo;s, with General Paoli, Lord Eliot, (formerly Mr. Eliot, of Port Eliot,) Dr. Beattie, and some other company. Talking of Lord Chesterfield; &mdash; JOHNSON. &lsquo;His manner was exquisitely elegant, and he had more knowledge than I expected.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Did you find, Sir, his conversation to be of a superiour style?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, in the conversation which I had with him I had the best right to superiority, for it was upon philology and literature.&rsquo; Lord Eliot, who had travelled at the same time with Mr. Stanhope, Lord Chesterfield&rsquo;s natural son, justly observed, that it was strange that a man who shewed he had so much affection for his son as Lord Chesterfield did, by writing so many long and anxious letters to him, almost all of them when he was Secretary of State, which certainly was a proof of great goodness of disposition, should endeavour to make his son a rascal. His Lordship told us, that Foote had intended to bring on the stage a father who had thus tutored his son, and to shew the son an honest man to every one else, but practising his father&rsquo;s maxims upon him, and cheating him. JOHNSON. &lsquo;I am much pleased with this design; but I think there was no occasion to make the son honest at all. No; he should be a consummate rogue: the contrast between honesty and knavery would be the stronger. It should be contrived so that the father should be the only sufferer by the son&rsquo;s villainy, and thus there would be poetical justice.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">A young gentleman present took up the argument against him, and maintained that no man ever thinks of the NOSE OF THE MIND, not adverting that though that figurative sense seems strange to us, as very unusual, it is truly not more forced than Hamlet&rsquo;s &lsquo;In my MIND&rsquo;S EYE, Horatio.&rsquo; He persisted much too long, and appeared to Johnson as putting himself forward as his antagonist with too much presumption; upon which he called to him in a loud tone, &lsquo;What is it you are contending for, if you BE contending?&rsquo; And afterwards imagining that the gentleman retorted upon him with a kind of smart drollery, he said, &lsquo;Mr. ***** it does not become you to talk so to me. Besides, ridicule is not your talent; you have THERE neither intuition nor sagacity.&rsquo; The gentleman protested that he had intended no improper freedom, but had the greatest respect for Dr. Johnson. After a short pause, during which we were somewhat uneasy, &mdash; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Give me your hand, Sir. You were too tedious, and I was too short.&rsquo; Mr. *****. &lsquo;Sir, I am honoured by your attention in any way.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Come, Sir, let&rsquo;s have no more of it. We offended one another by our contention; let us not offend the company by our compliments.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He now said, &lsquo;He wished much to go to Italy, and that he dreaded passing the winter in England.&rsquo; I said nothing; but enjoyed a secret satisfaction in thinking that I had taken the most effectual measures to make such a scheme practicable.</p>
<p class="p24">On Monday, June 28, I had the honour to receive from the Lord Chancellor the following letter: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;TO JAMES BOSWELL, ESQ.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;SIR, &mdash; I should have answered your letter immediately, if (being much engaged when I received it) I had not put it in my pocket, and forgot to open it till this morning.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am much obliged to you for the suggestion; and I will adopt and press it as far as I can. The best argument, I am sure, and I hope it is not likely to fail, is Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s merit. But it will be necessary, if I should be so unfortunate as to miss seeing you, to converse with Sir Joshua on the sum it will be proper to ask, &mdash; in short, upon the means of setting him out. It would be a reflection on us all, if such a man should perish for want of the means to take care of his health. Yours, &amp;c.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;THURLOW.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">This letter gave me a very high satisfaction; I next day went and shewed it to Sir Joshua Reynolds, who was exceedingly pleased with it. He thought that I should now communicate the negociation to Dr. Johnson, who might afterwards complain if the attention with which he had been honoured, should be too long concealed from him. I intended to set out for Scotland next morning; but Sir Joshua cordially insisted that I should stay another day, that Johnson and I might dine with him, that we three might talk of his Italian Tour, and, as Sir Joshua expressed himself, &lsquo;have it all out.&rsquo; I hastened to Johnson, and was told by him that he was rather better to-day. BOSWELL. &lsquo;I am very anxious about you, Sir, and particularly that you should go to Italy for the winter, which I believe is your own wish.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;It is, Sir.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;You have no objection, I presume, but the money it would require.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, no, Sir.&rsquo; Upon which I gave him a particular account of what had been done, and read to him the Lord Chancellor&rsquo;s letter. He listened with much attention; then warmly said, &lsquo;This is taking prodigious pains about a man.&rsquo; &lsquo;O! Sir, (said I, with most sincere affection,) your friends would do every thing for you.&rsquo; He paused, grew more and more agitated, till tears started into his eyes, and he exclaimed with fervent emotion, &lsquo;GOD bless you all.&rsquo; I was so affected that I also shed tears. After a short silence, he renewed and extended his grateful benediction, &lsquo;GOD bless you all, for JESUS CHRIST&rsquo;S sake.&rsquo; We both remained for some time unable to speak. He rose suddenly and quitted the room, quite melted in tenderness. He staid but a short time, till he had recovered his firmness; soon after he returned I left him, having first engaged him to dine at Sir Joshua Reynolds&rsquo;s, next day. I never was again under that roof which I had so long reverenced.</p>
<p class="p24">On Wednesday, June 30, the friendly confidential dinner with Sir Joshua Reynolds took place, no other company being present. Had I known that this was the last time that I should enjoy in this world, the conversation of a friend whom I so much respected, and from whom I derived so much instruction and entertainment, I should have been deeply affected. When I now look back to it, I am vexed that a single word should have been forgotten.</p>
<p class="p24">Both Sir Joshua and I were so sanguine in our expectations, that we expatiated with confidence on the liberal provision which we were sure would be made for him, conjecturing whether munificence would be displayed in one large donation, or in an ample increase of his pension. He himself catched so much of our enthusiasm, as to allow himself to suppose it not impossible that our hopes might in one way or other be realised. He said that he would rather have his pension doubled than a grant of a thousand pounds; &lsquo;For, (said he,) though probably I may not live to receive as much as a thousand pounds, a man would have the consciousness that he should pass the remainder of his life in splendour, how long soever it might be.&rsquo; Considering what a moderate proportion an income of six hundred pounds a year bears to innumerable fortunes in this country, it is worthy of remark, that a man so truly great should think it splendour.</p>
<p class="p24">As an instance of extraordinary liberality of friendship, he told us, that Dr. Brocklesby had upon this occasion offered him a hundred a year for his life. A grateful tear started into his eye, as he spoke this in a faultering tone.</p>
<p class="p24">Sir Joshua and I endeavoured to flatter his imagination with agreeable prospects of happiness in Italy. &lsquo;Nay, (said he,) I must not expect much of that; when a man goes to Italy merely to feel how he breathes the air, he can enjoy very little.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Our conversation turned upon living in the country, which Johnson, whose melancholy mind required the dissipation of quick successive variety, had habituated himself to consider as a kind of mental imprisonment. &lsquo;Yet, Sir, (said I,) there are many people who are content to live in the country.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, it is in the intellectual world as in the physical world; we are told by natural philosophers that a body is at rest in the place that is fit for it; they who are content to live in the country, are FIT for the country.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Talking of various enjoyments, I argued that a refinement of taste was a disadvantage, as they who have attained to it must be seldomer pleased than those who have no nice discrimination, and are therefore satisfied with every thing that comes in their way. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Nay, Sir; that is a paltry notion. Endeavour to be as perfect as you can in every respect.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I accompanied him in Sir Joshua Reynolds&rsquo;s coach, to the entry of Bolt-court. He asked me whether I would not go with him to his house; I declined it, from an apprehension that my spirits would sink. We bade adieu to each other affectionately in the carriage. When he had got down upon the foot-pavement, he called out, &lsquo;Fare you well;&rsquo; and without looking back, sprung away with a kind of pathetick briskness, if I may use that expression, which seemed to indicate a struggle to conceal uneasiness, and impressed me with a foreboding of our long, long separation.</p>
<p class="p24">I remained one day more in town, to have the chance of talking over my negociation with the Lord Chancellor; but the multiplicity of his Lordship&rsquo;s important engagements did not allow of it; so I left the management of the business in the hands of Sir Joshua Reynolds.</p>
<p class="p24">Soon after this time Dr. Johnson had the mortification of being informed by Mrs. Thrale, that, &lsquo;what she supposed he never believed,&rsquo; was true; namely, that she was actually going to marry Signor Piozzi, an Italian musick-master. He endeavoured to prevent it; but in vain. If she would publish the whole of the correspondence that passed between Dr. Johnson and her on the subject, we should have a full view of his real sentiments. As it is, our judgement must be biassed by that characteristick specimen which Sir John Hawkins has given us: &lsquo;Poor Thrale! I thought that either her virtue or her vice would have restrained her from such a marriage. She is now become a subject for her enemies to exult over; and for her friends, if she has any left, to forget, or pity.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">It must be admitted that Johnson derived a considerable portion of happiness from the comforts and elegancies which he enjoyed in Mr. Thrale&rsquo;s family; but Mrs. Thrale assures us he was indebted for these to her husband alone, who certainly respected him sincerely.</p>
<p class="p24">Having left the PIOUS NEGOCIATION, as I called it, in the best hands, I shall here insert what relates to it. Johnson wrote to Sir Joshua Reynolds on July 6, as follows: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am going, I hope, in a few days, to try the air of Derbyshire, but hope to see you before I go. Let me, however, mention to you what I have much at heart. If the Chancellor should continue his attention to Mr. Boswell&rsquo;s request, and confer with you on the means of relieving my languid state, I am very desirous to avoid the appearance of asking money upon false pretences. I desire you to represent to his Lordship, what, as soon as it is suggested, he will perceive to be reasonable, &mdash; That, if I grow much worse, I shall be afraid to leave my physicians, to suffer the inconveniences of travel, and pine in the solitude of a foreign country; That, if I grow much better, of which indeed there is now little appearance, I shall not wish to leave my friends and my domestick comforts; for I do not travel, for pleasure or curiosity; yet if I should recover, curiosity would revive. In my present state, I am desirous to make a struggle for a little longer life, and hope to obtain some help from a softer climate. Do for me what you can.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">By a letter from Sir Joshua Reynolds I was informed, that the Lord Chancellor had called on him, and acquainted him that the application had not been successful; but that his Lordship, after speaking highly in praise of Johnson, as a man who was an honour to his country, desired Sir Joshua to let him know, that on granting a mortgage of his pension, he should draw on his Lordship to the amount of five or six hundred pounds; and that his Lordship explained the meaning of the mortgage to be, that he wished the business to be conducted in such a manner, that Dr. Johnson should appear to be under the least possible obligation. Sir Joshua mentioned, that he had by the same post communicated all this to Dr. Johnson.</p>
<p class="p24">How Johnson was affected upon the occasion will appear from what he wrote to Sir Joshua Reynolds: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Ashbourne, Sept. 9. Many words I hope are not necessary between you and me, to convince you what gratitude is excited in my heart by the Chancellor&rsquo;s liberality, and your kind offices. . . .</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I have enclosed a letter to the Chancellor, which, when you have read it, you will be pleased to seal with a head, or any other general seal, and convey it to him: had I sent it directly to him, I should have seemed to overlook the favour of your intervention.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;TO THE LORD HIGH CHANCELLOR.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;MY LORD, &mdash; After a long and not inattentive observation of mankind, the generosity of your Lordship&rsquo;s offer raises in me not less wonder than gratitude. Bounty, so liberally bestowed, I should gladly receive, if my condition made it necessary; for, to such a mind, who would not be proud to own his obligations? But it has pleased GOD to restore me to so great a measure of health, that if I should now appropriate so much of a fortune destined to do good, I could not escape from myself the charge of advancing a false claim. My journey to the continent, though I once thought it necessary, was never much encouraged by my physicians; and I was very desirous that your Lordship should be told of it by Sir Joshua Reynolds, as an event very uncertain; for if I grew much better, I should not be willing, if much worse, not able, to migrate. Your Lordship was first solicited without my knowledge; but, when I was told that you were pleased to honour me with your patronage, I did not expect to hear of a refusal; yet, as I have had no long time to brood hope, and have not rioted in imaginary opulence, this cold reception has been scarce a disappointment; and, from your Lordship&rsquo;s kindness, I have received a benefit, which only men like you are able to bestow. I shall now live mihi carior, with a higher opinion of my own merit. I am, my Lord, your Lordship&rsquo;s most obliged, most grateful, and most humble servant,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;September, 1784.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Upon this unexpected failure I abstain from presuming to make any remarks, or to offer any conjectures.</p>
<p class="p24">Let us now contemplate Johnson thirty years after the death of his wife, still retaining for her all the tenderness of affection.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;TO THE REVEREND MR. BAGSHAW, AT BROMLEY.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;SIR, &mdash; Perhaps you may remember, that in the year 1753, you committed to the ground my dear wife. I now entreat your permission to lay a stone upon her; and have sent the inscription, that, if you find it proper, you may signify your allowance.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;You will do me a great favour by showing the place where she lies, that the stone may protect her remains.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Mr. Ryland will wait on you for the inscription, and procure it to be engraved. You will easily believe that I shrink from this mournful office. When it is done, if I have strength remaining, I will visit Bromley once again, and pay you part of the respect to which you have a right from, Reverend Sir, your most humble servant,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;July 12, 1784.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Next day he set out on a jaunt to Staffordshire and Derbyshire, flattering himself that he might be in some degree relieved.</p>
<p class="p24">During his absence from London he kept up a correspondence with several of his friends, from which I shall select what appears to me proper for publication, without attending nicely to chronological order.</p>
<p class="p24">TO DR. BROCKLESBY, he writes, Ashbourne, Sept. 9: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Do you know the Duke and Duchess of Devonshire? And have you ever seen Chatsworth? I was at Chatsworth on Monday: I had indeed seen it before, but never when its owners were at home; I was very kindly received, and honestly pressed to stay: but I told them that a sick man is not a fit inmate of a great house. But I hope to go again some time.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Sept. 11. &lsquo;I think nothing grows worse, but all rather better, except sleep, and that of late has been at its old pranks. Last evening, I felt what I had not known for a long time, an inclination to walk for amusement; I took a short walk, and came back again neither breathless nor fatigued. This has been a gloomy, frigid, ungenial summer, but of late it seems to mend; I hear the heat sometimes mentioned, but I do not feel it:</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Praeterea minimus gelido jam in corpore sanguis</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Febre calet sola.&mdash; &ldquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I hope, however, with good help, to find means of supporting a winter at home, and to hear and tell at the Club what is doing, and what ought to be doing in the world. I have no company here, and shall naturally come home hungry for conversation. To wish you, dear Sir, more leisure, would not be kind; but what leisure you have, you must bestow upon me.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Lichfield, Sept. 29. &lsquo;On one day I had three letters about the air-balloon: yours was far the best, and has enabled me to impart to my friends in the country an idea of this species of amusement. In amusement, mere amusement, I am afraid it must end, for I do not find that its course can be directed so as that it should serve any purposes of communication; and it can give no new intelligence of the state of the air at different heights, till they have ascended above the height of mountains, which they seem never likely to do. I came hither on the 27th. How long I shall stay I have not determined. My dropsy is gone, and my asthma much remitted, but I have felt myself a little declining these two days, or at least to-day; but such vicissitudes must be expected. One day may be worse than another; but this last month is far better than the former; if the next should be as much better than this, I shall run about the town on my own legs.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">October 25. &lsquo;You write to me with a zeal that animates, and a tenderness that melts me. I am not afraid either of a journey to London, or a residence in it. I came down with little fatigue, and am now not weaker. In the smoky atmosphere I was delivered from the dropsy, which I consider as the original and radical disease. The town is my element*; there are my friends, there are my books, to which I have not yet bid farewell, and there are my amusements. Sir Joshua told me long ago that my vocation was to publick life, and I hope still to keep my station, till God shall bid me Go in peace.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* His love of London continually appears.&nbsp; In a letter from</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him to Mrs. Smart, wife of his friend the Poet, which is</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;published in a well-written life of him, prefixed to an</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;edition of his Poems, in 1791, there is the following</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sentence:&mdash; &lsquo;To one that has passed so many years in the</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pleasures and opulence of London, there are few places that</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;can give much delight.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once, upon reading that line in the curious epitaph quoted</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in The Spectator,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Born in New-England, did in London die;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he laughed and said, &lsquo;I do not wonder at this.&nbsp; It would</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have been strange, if born in London, he had died in</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New-England.&rsquo; &mdash; BOSWELL.</p>
<p class="p24">TO SIR JOSHUA REYNOLDS: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">Ashbourne, Sept. 2. &lsquo;. . . I still continue by God&rsquo;s mercy to mend. My breath is easier, my nights are quieter, and my legs are less in bulk, and stronger in use. I have, however, yet a great deal to overcome, before I can yet attain even an old man&rsquo;s health. Write, do write to me now and then; we are now old acquaintance, and perhaps few people have lived so much and so long together, with less cause of complaint on either side. The retrospection of this is very pleasant, and I hope we shall never think on each other with less kindness.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Sept. 9. &lsquo;I could not answer your letter before this day, because I went on the sixth to Chatsworth, and did not come back till the post was gone. Many words, I hope, are not necessary between you and me, to convince you what gratitude is excited in my heart, by the Chancellor&rsquo;s liberality and your kind offices. I did not indeed expect that what was asked by the Chancellor would have been refused, but since it has, we will not tell that any thing has been asked. I have enclosed a letter to the Chancellor which, when you have read it, you will be pleased to seal with a head, or other general seal, and convey it to him; had I sent it directly to him, I should have seemed to overlook the favour of your intervention. I do not despair of supporting an English winter. At Chatsworth, I met young Mr. Burke, who led me very commodiously into conversation with the Duke and Duchess. We had a very good morning. The dinner was publick.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Sept. 18. &lsquo;I have three letters this day, all about the balloon, I could have been content with one. Do not write about the balloon, whatever else you may think proper to say.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">It may be observed, that his writing in every way, whether for the publick, or privately to his friends, was by fits and starts; for we see frequently, that many letters are written on the same day. When he had once overcome his aversion to begin, he was, I suppose, desirous to go on, in order to relieve his mind from the uneasy reflection of delaying what he ought to do.</p>
<p class="p24">We now behold Johnson for the last time, in his native city, for which he ever retained a warm affection, and which, by a sudden apostrophe, under the word Lich, he introduces with reverence, into his immortal Work, THE ENGLISH DICTIONARY: &mdash; Salve, magna parens! While here, he felt a revival of all the tenderness of filial affection, an instance of which appeared in his ordering the grave-stone and inscription over Elizabeth Blaney* to be substantially and carefully renewed.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* His mother. &mdash; ED.</p>
<p class="p24">To Mr. Henry White, a young clergyman, with whom he now formed an intimacy, so as to talk to him with great freedom, he mentioned that he could not in general accuse himself of having been an undutiful son. &lsquo;Once, indeed, (said he,) I was disobedient; I refused to attend my father to Uttoxeter-market. Pride was the source of that refusal, and the remembrance of it was painful. A few years ago, I desired to atone for this fault; I went to Uttoxeter in very bad weather, and stood for a considerable time bareheaded in the rain, on the spot where my father&rsquo;s stall used to stand. In contrition I stood, and I hope the penance was expiatory.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I told him (says Miss Seward) in one of my latest visits to him, of a wonderful learned pig, which I had seen at Nottingham; and which did all that we have observed exhibited by dogs and horses. The subject amused him. &ldquo;Then, (said he,) the pigs are a race unjustly calumniated. PIG has, it seems, not been wanting to MAN, but MAN to PIG. We do not allow TIME for his education, we kill him at a year old.&rdquo; Mr. Henry White, who was present, observed that if this instance had happened in or before Pope&rsquo;s time, he would not have been justified in instancing the swine as the lowest degree of groveling instinct. Dr. Johnson seemed pleased with the observation, while the person who made it proceeded to remark, that great torture must have been employed, ere the indocility of the animal could have been subdued. &ldquo;Certainly, (said the Doctor;) but, (turning to me,) how old is your pig?&rdquo; I told him, three years old. &ldquo;Then, (said he,) the pig has no cause to complain; he would have been killed the first year if he had not been EDUCATED, and protracted existence is a good recompence for very considerable degrees of torture.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">As Johnson had now very faint hopes of recovery, and as Mrs. Thrale was no longer devoted to him, it might have been supposed that he would naturally have chosen to remain in the comfortable house of his beloved wife&rsquo;s daughter, and end his life where he began it. But there was in him an animated and lofty spirit, and however complicated diseases might depress ordinary mortals, all who saw him, beheld and acknowledged the invictum animum Catonis. Such was his intellectual ardour even at this time, that he said to one friend, &lsquo;Sir, I look upon every day to be lost, in which I do not make a new acquaintance;&rsquo; and to another, when talking of his illness, &lsquo;I will be conquered; I will not capitulate.&rsquo; And such was his love of London, so high a relish had he of its magnificent extent, and variety of intellectual entertainment, that he languished when absent from it, his mind having become quite luxurious from the long habit of enjoying the metropolis; and, therefore, although at Lichfield, surrounded with friends, who loved and revered him, and for whom he had a very sincere affection, he still found that such conversation as London affords, could be found no where else. These feelings, joined, probably, to some flattering hopes of aid from the eminent physicians and surgeons in London, who kindly and generously attended him without accepting fees, made him resolve to return to the capital.</p>
<p class="p24">From Lichfield he came to Birmingham, where he passed a few days with his worthy old schoolfellow, Mr. Hector, who thus writes to me:&mdash; &lsquo;He was very solicitous with me to recollect some of our most early transactions, and transmit them to him, for I perceive nothing gave him greater pleasure than calling to mind those days of our innocence. I complied with his request, and he only received them a few days before his death. I have transcribed for your inspection, exactly the minutes I wrote to him.&rsquo; This paper having been found in his repositories after his death, Sir John Hawkins has inserted it entire, and I have made occasional use of it and other communications from Mr. Hector, in the course of this Work. I have both visited and corresponded with him since Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s death, and by my inquiries concerning a great variety of particulars have obtained additional information. I followed the same mode with the Reverend Dr. Taylor, in whose presence I wrote down a good deal of what he could tell; and he, at my request, signed his name, to give it authenticity. It is very rare to find any person who is able to give a distinct account of the life even of one whom he has known intimately, without questions being put to them. My friend Dr. Kippis has told me, that on this account it is a practice with him to draw out a biographical catechism.</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson then proceeded to Oxford, where he was again kindly received by Dr. Adams.</p>
<p class="p24">He arrived in London on the 16th of November, and next day sent to Dr. Burney the following note, which I insert as the last token of his remembrance of that ingenious and amiable man, and as another of the many proofs of the tenderness and benignity of his heart: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;MR. JOHNSON, who came home last night, sends his respects to dear Dr. Burney, and all the dear Burneys, little and great.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Having written to him, in bad spirits, a letter filled with dejection and fretfulness, and at the same time expressing anxious apprehensions concerning him, on account of a dream which had disturbed me; his answer was chiefly in terms of reproach, for a supposed charge of &lsquo;affecting discontent, and indulging the vanity of complaint.&rsquo; It, however, proceeded, &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Write to me often, and write like a man. I consider your fidelity and tenderness as a great part of the comforts which are yet left me, and sincerely wish we could be nearer to each other. . . . My dear friend, life is very short and very uncertain; let us spend it as well as we can. My worthy neighbour, Allen, is dead. Love me as well as you can. Pay my respects to dear Mrs. Boswell. Nothing ailed me at that time; let your superstition at last have an end.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Feeling very soon, that the manner in which he had written might hurt me, he two days afterwards, July 28, wrote to me again, giving me an account of his sufferings; after which, he thus proceeds: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Before this letter, you will have had one which I hope you will not take amiss; for it contains only truth, and that truth kindly intended. . . . Spartam quam nactus es orna; make the most and best of your lot, and compare yourself not with the few that are above you, but with the multitudes which are below you.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Yet it was not a little painful to me to find, that . . . he still persevered in arraigning me as before, which was strange in him who had so much experience of what I suffered. I, however, wrote to him two as kind letters as I could; the last of which came too late to be read by him, for his illness encreased more rapidly upon him than I had apprehended; but I had the consolation of being informed that he spoke of me on his death-bed, with affection, and I look forward with humble hope of renewing our friendship in a better world.</p>
<p class="p24">Soon after Johnson&rsquo;s return to the metropolis, both the asthma and dropsy became more violent and distressful.</p>
<p class="p24">During his sleepless nights he amused himself by translating into Latin verse, from the Greek, many of the epigrams in the Anthologia. These translations, with some other poems by him in Latin, he gave to his friend Mr. Langton, who, having added a few notes, sold them to the booksellers for a small sum, to be given to some of Johnson&rsquo;s relations, which was accordingly done; and they are printed in the collection of his works.</p>
<p class="p24">A very erroneous notion has circulated as to Johnson&rsquo;s deficiency in the knowledge of the Greek language, partly owing to the modesty with which, from knowing how much there was to be learnt, he used to mention his own comparative acquisitions. When Mr. Cumberland talked to him of the Greek fragments which are so well illustrated in The Observer, and of the Greek dramatists in general, he candidly acknowledged his insufficiency in that particular branch of Greek literature. Yet it may be said, that though not a great, he was a good Greek scholar. Dr. Charles Burney, the younger, who is universally acknowledged by the best judges to be one of the few men of this age who are very eminent for their skill in that noble language, has assured me, that Johnson could give a Greek word for almost every English one; and that although not sufficiently conversant in the niceties of the language, he upon some occasions discovered, even in these, a considerable degree of critical acumen. Mr. Dalzel, Professor of Greek at Edinburgh, whose skill in it is unquestionable, mentioned to me, in very liberal terms, the impression which was made upon him by Johnson, in a conversation which they had in London concerning that language. As Johnson, therefore, was undoubtedly one of the first Latin scholars in modern times, let us not deny to his fame some additional splendour from Greek.</p>
<p class="p24">The ludicrous imitators of Johnson&rsquo;s style are innumerable. Their general method is to accumulate hard words, without considering, that, although he was fond of introducing them occasionally, there is not a single sentence in all his writings where they are crowded together, as in the first verse of the following imaginary Ode by him to Mrs. Thrale, which appeared in the newspapers: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Cervisial coctor&rsquo;s viduate dame,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opin&rsquo;st thou this gigantick frame,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Procumbing at thy shrine:</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall, catenated by thy charms,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A captive in thy ambient arms,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perennially be thine?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">This, and a thousand other such attempts, are totally unlike the original, which the writers imagined they were turning into ridicule. There is not similarity enough for burlesque, or even for caricature.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;TO MR. GREEN, APOTHECARY, AT LICHFIELD.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;DEAR SIR, &mdash; I have enclosed the Epitaph for my Father, Mother, and Brother, to be all engraved on the large size, and laid in the middle aisle in St. Michael&rsquo;s church, which I request the clergyman and churchwardens to permit.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The first care must be to find the exact place of interment, that the stone may protect the bodies. Then let the stone be deep, massy, and hard; and do not let the difference of ten pounds, or more, defeat our purpose.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I have enclosed ten pounds, and Mrs. Porter will pay you ten more, which I gave her for the same purpose. What more is wanted shall be sent; and I beg that all possible haste may be made, for I wish to have it done while I am yet alive. Let me know, dear Sir, that you receive this. I am, Sir, your most humble servant,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Dec. 2, 1784.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Death had always been to him an object of terrour; so that, though by no means happy, he still clung to life with an eagerness at which many have wondered. At any time when he was ill, he was very much pleased to be told that he looked better. An ingenious member of the Eumelian Club, informs me, that upon one occasion when he said to him that he saw health returning to his cheek, Johnson seized him by the hand and exclaimed, &lsquo;Sir, you are one of the kindest friends I ever had.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Dr. Heberden, Dr. Brocklesby, Dr. Warren, and Dr. Butter, physicians, generously attended him, without accepting any fees, as did Mr. Cruikshank, surgeon; and all that could be done from professional skill and ability, was tried, to prolong a life so truly valuable. He himself, indeed, having, on account of his very bad constitution, been perpetually applying himself to medical inquiries, united his own efforts with those of the gentlemen who attended him; and imagining that the dropsical collection of water which oppressed him might be drawn off by making incisions in his body, he, with his usual resolute defiance of pain, cut deep, when he thought that his surgeon had done it too tenderly.*</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* This bold experiment, Sir John Hawkins has related in such</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a manner as to suggest a charge against Johnson of</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;intentionally hastening his end; a charge so very</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;inconsistent with his character in every respect, that it is</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;injurious even to refute it, as Sir John has thought it</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;necessary to do.&nbsp; It is evident, that what Johnson did in</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hopes of relief, indicated an extraordinary eagerness to</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;retard his dissolution. &mdash; BOSWELL.</p>
<p class="p24">About eight or ten days before his death, when Dr. Brocklesby paid him his morning visit, he seemed very low and desponding, and said, &lsquo;I have been as a dying man all night.&rsquo; He then emphatically broke out in the words of Shakspeare: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Can&rsquo;st thou not minister to a mind diseas&rsquo;d;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pluck from the memory a rooted sorrow;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raze out the written troubles of the brain;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, with some sweet oblivious antidote,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cleanse the stuff&rsquo;d bosom of that perilous stuff,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which weighs upon the heart?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">To which Dr. Brocklesby readily answered, from the same great poet: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo; &mdash; therein the patient</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Must minister to himself.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson expressed himself much satisfied with the application.</p>
<p class="p24">On another day after this, when talking on the subject of prayer, Dr. Brocklesby repeated from Juvenal, &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Orandum est, ut sit mens sana in corpore sano,&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">and so on to the end of the tenth satire; but in running it quickly over, he happened, in the line,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Qui spatium vitae extremum inter munera ponat,&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">to pronounce supremum for extremum; at which Johnson&rsquo;s critical ear instantly took offence, and discoursing vehemently on the unmetrical effect of such a lapse, he shewed himself as full as ever of the spirit of the grammarian.</p>
<p class="p24">Having no near relations, it had been for some time Johnson&rsquo;s intention to make a liberal provision for his faithful servant, Mr. Francis Barber, whom he looked upon as particularly under his protection, and whom he had all along treated truly as an humble friend. Having asked Dr. Brocklesby what would be a proper annuity to a favourite servant, and being answered that it must depend on the circumstances of the master; and, that in the case of a nobleman, fifty pounds a year was considered as an adequate reward for many years&rsquo; faithful service; &lsquo;Then, (said Johnson,) shall I be nobilissimus, for I mean to leave Frank seventy pounds a year, and I desire you to tell him so.&rsquo; It is strange, however, to think, that Johnson was not free from that general weakness of being averse to execute a will, so that he delayed it from time to time; and had it not been for Sir John Hawkins&rsquo;s repeatedly urging it, I think it is probable that his kind resolution would not have been fulfilled. After making one, which, as Sir John Hawkins informs us, extended no further than the promised annuity, Johnson&rsquo;s final disposition of his property was established by a Will and Codicil.</p>
<p class="p24">The consideration of numerous papers of which he was possessed, seems to have struck Johnson&rsquo;s mind, with a sudden anxiety, and as they were in great confusion, it is much to be lamented that he had not entrusted some faithful and discreet person with the care and selection of them; instead of which, he in a precipitate manner, burnt large masses of them, with little regard, as I apprehend, to discrimination. Not that I suppose we have thus been deprived of any compositions which he had ever intended for the publick eye; but, from what escaped the flames, I judge that many curious circumstances relating both to himself and other literary characters have perished.</p>
<p class="p24">Two very valuable articles, I am sure, we have lost, which were two quarto volumes, containing a full, fair, and most particular account of his own life, from his earliest recollection. I owned to him, that having accidentally seen them, I had read a great deal in them; and apologizing for the liberty I had taken, asked him if I could help it. He placidly answered, &lsquo;Why, Sir, I do not think you could have helped it.&rsquo; I said that I had, for once in my life, felt half an inclination to commit theft. It had come into my mind to carry off those two volumes, and never see him more. Upon my inquiring how this would have affected him, &lsquo;Sir, (said he,) I believe I should have gone mad.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">During his last illness, Johnson experienced the steady and kind attachment of his numerous friends. Mr. Hoole has drawn up a narrative of what passed in the visits which he paid him during that time, from the 10th of November to the 13th of December, the day of his death, inclusive, and has favoured me with a perusal of it, with permission to make extracts, which I have done. Nobody was more attentive to him than Mr. Langton, to whom he tenderly said, Te teneam moriens deficiente manu. And I think it highly to the honour of Mr. Windham, that his important occupations as an active statesman did not prevent him from paying assiduous respect to the dying Sage whom he revered, Mr. Langton informs me, that, &lsquo;one day he found Mr. Burke and four or five more friends sitting with Johnson. Mr. Burke said to him, &ldquo;I am afraid, Sir, such a number of us may be oppressive to you.&rdquo; &ldquo;No, Sir, (said Johnson,) it is not so; and I must be in a wretched state, indeed, when your company would not be a delight to me.&rdquo; Mr. Burke, in a tremulous voice, expressive of being very tenderly affected, replied, &ldquo;My dear Sir, you have always been too good to me.&rdquo; Immediately afterwards he went away. This was the last circumstance in the acquaintance of these two eminent men.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">The following particulars of his conversation within a few days of his death, I give on the authority of Mr. John Nichols: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;He said, that the Parliamentary Debates were the only part of his writings which then gave him any compunction: but that at the time he wrote them, he had no conception he was imposing upon the world, though they were frequently written from very slender materials, and often from none at all, &mdash; the mere coinage of his own imagination. He never wrote any part of his works with equal velocity. Three columns of the Magazine, in an hour, was no uncommon effort, which was faster than most persons could have transcribed that quantity.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Of his friend Cave, he always spoke with great affection. &ldquo;Yet (said he,) Cave, (who never looked out of his window, but with a view to the Gentleman&rsquo;s Magazine,) was a penurious pay-master; he would contract for lines by the hundred, and expect the long hundred; but he was a good man, and always delighted to have his friends at his table.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;He said at another time, three or four days only before his death, speaking of the little fear he had of undergoing a chirurgical operation, &ldquo;I would give one of these legs for a year more of life, I mean of comfortable life, not such as that which I now suffer;&rdquo; &mdash; and lamented much his inability to read during his hours of restlessness; &ldquo;I used formerly, (he added,) when sleepless in bed, to read like a Turk.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Whilst confined by his last illness, it was his regular practice to have the church-service read to him, by some attentive and friendly Divine. The Rev. Mr. Hoole performed this kind office in my presence for the last time, when, by his own desire, no more than the Litany was read; in which his responses were in the deep and sonorous voice which Mr. Boswell has occasionally noticed, and with the most profound devotion that can be imagined. His hearing not being quite perfect, he more than once interrupted Mr. Hoole, with &ldquo;Louder, my dear Sir, louder, I entreat you, or you pray in vain!&rdquo; &mdash; and, when the service was ended, he, with great earnestness, turned round to an excellent lady who was present, saying, &ldquo;I thank you, Madam, very heartily, for your kindness in joining me in this solemn exercise. Live well, I conjure you; and you will not feel the compunction at the last, which I now feel.&rdquo; So truly humble were the thoughts which this great and good man entertained of his own approaches to religious perfection.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Amidst the melancholy clouds which hung over the dying Johnson, his characteristical manner shewed itself on different occasions.</p>
<p class="p24">When Dr. Warren, in the usual style, hoped that he was better; his answer was, &lsquo;No, Sir; you cannot conceive with what acceleration I advance towards death.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">A man whom he had never seen before was employed one night to sit up with him. Being asked next morning how he liked his attendant, his answer was, &lsquo;Not at all, Sir: the fellow&rsquo;s an ideot; he is as aukward as a turn-spit when first put into the wheel, and as sleepy as a dormouse.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Mr. Windham having placed a pillow conveniently to support him, he thanked him for his kindness, and said, &lsquo;That will do, &mdash; all that a pillow can do.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He requested three things of Sir Joshua Reynolds: &mdash; To forgive him thirty pounds which he had borrowed of him; to read the Bible; and never to use his pencil on a Sunday. Sir Joshua readily acquiesced.</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson, with that native fortitude, which, amidst all his bodily distress and mental sufferings, never forsook him, asked Dr. Brocklesby, as a man in whom he had confidence, to tell him plainly whether he could recover. &lsquo;Give me (said he,) a direct answer.&rsquo; The Doctor having first asked him if he could hear the whole truth, which way soever it might lead, and being answered that he could, declared that, in his opinion, he could not recover without a miracle. &lsquo;Then, (said Johnson,) I will take no more physick, not even my opiates; for I have prayed that I may render up my soul to GOD unclouded.&rsquo; In this resolution he persevered, and, at the same time, used only the weakest kinds of sustenance. Being pressed by Mr. Windham to take somewhat more generous nourishment, lest too low a diet should have the very effect which he dreaded, by debilitating his mind, he said, &lsquo;I will take any thing but inebriating sustenance.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">The Reverend Mr. Strahan, who was the son of his friend, and had been always one of his great favourites, had, during his last illness, the satisfaction of contributing to soothe and comfort him. That gentleman&rsquo;s house, at Islington, of which he is Vicar, afforded Johnson, occasionally and easily, an agreeable change of place and fresh air; and he attended also upon him in town in the discharge of the sacred offices of his profession.</p>
<p class="p24">Mr. Strahan has given me the agreeable assurance, that, after being in much agitation, Johnson became quite composed, and continued so till his death.</p>
<p class="p24">Dr. Brocklesby, who will not be suspected of fanaticism, obliged me with the following account: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;For some time before his death, all his fears were calmed and absorbed by the prevalence of his faith, and his trust in the merits and propitiation of JESUS CHRIST.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson having thus in his mind the true Christian scheme, at once rational and consolatory, uniting justice and mercy in the Divinity, with the improvement of human nature, previous to his receiving the Holy Sacrament in his apartment, composed and fervently uttered this prayer: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Almighty and most merciful Father, I am now as to human eyes, it seems, about to commemorate, for the last time, the death of thy Son JESUS CHRIST, our Saviour and Redeemer. Grant, O LORD, that my whole hope and confidence may be in his merits, and thy mercy; enforce and accept my imperfect repentance; make this commemoration available to the confirmation of my faith, the establishment of my hope, and the enlargement of my charity; and make the death of thy Son JESUS CHRIST effectual to my redemption. Have mercy upon me, and pardon the multitude of my offences. Bless my friends; have mercy upon all men. Support me, by thy Holy Spirit, in the days of weakness, and at the hour of death; and receive me, at my death, to everlasting happiness, for the sake of JESUS CHRIST. Amen.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Having, as has been already mentioned, made his will on the 8th and 9th of December, and settled all his worldly affairs, he languished till Monday, the 13th of that month, when he expired, about seven o&rsquo;clock in the evening, with so little apparent pain that his attendants hardly perceived when his dissolution took place.</p>
<p class="p24">Of his last moments, my brother, Thomas David, has furnished me with the following particulars: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The Doctor, from the time that he was certain his death was near, appeared to be perfectly resigned, was seldom or never fretful or out of temper, and often said to his faithful servant, who gave me this account, &ldquo;Attend, Francis, to the salvation of your soul, which is the object of greatest importance:&rdquo; he also explained to him passages in the Scripture, and seemed to have pleasure in talking upon religious subjects.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;On Monday, the 13th of December, the day on which he died, a Miss Morris, daughter to a particular friend of his, called, and said to Francis, that she begged to be permitted to see the Doctor, that she might earnestly request him to give her his blessing. Francis went into his room, followed by the young lady, and delivered the message. The Doctor turned himself in the bed, and said, &ldquo;GOD bless you, my dear!&rdquo; These were the last words he spoke. His difficulty of breathing increased till about seven o&rsquo;clock in the evening, when Mr. Barber and Mrs. Desmoulins, who were sitting in the room, observing that the noise he made in breathing had ceased, went to the bed, and found he was dead.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">About two days after his death, the following very agreeable account was communicated to Mr. Malone, in a letter by the Honourable John Byng, to whom I am much obliged for granting me permission to introduce it in my work.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;DEAR SIR, &mdash; Since I saw you, I have had a long conversation with Cawston, who sat up with Dr. Johnson, from nine o&rsquo;clock, on Sunday evening, till ten o&rsquo;clock, on Monday morning. And, from what I can gather from him, it should seem, that Dr. Johnson was perfectly composed, steady in hope, and resigned to death. At the interval of each hour, they assisted him to sit up in his bed, and move his legs, which were in much pain; when he regularly addressed himself to fervent prayer; and though, sometimes, his voice failed him, his senses never did, during that time. The only sustenance he received, was cyder and water. He said his mind was prepared, and the time to his dissolution seemed long. At six in the morning, he inquired the hour, and, on being informed, said that all went on regularly, and he felt he had but a few hours to live.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;At ten o&rsquo;clock in the morning, he parted from Cawston, saying, &ldquo;You should not detain Mr. Windham&rsquo;s servant: &mdash; I thank you; bear my remembrance to your master.&rdquo; Cawston says, that no man could appear more collected, more devout, or less terrified at the thoughts of the approaching minute.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;This account, which is so much more agreeable than, and somewhat different from, yours, has given us the satisfaction of thinking that that great man died as he lived, full of resignation, strengthened in faith, and joyful in hope.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">A few days before his death, he had asked Sir John Hawkins, as one of his executors, where he should be buried; and on being answered, &lsquo;Doubtless, in Westminster-Abbey,&rsquo; seemed to feel a satisfaction, very natural to a Poet; and indeed in my opinion very natural to every man of any imagination, who has no family sepulchre in which he can be laid with his fathers. Accordingly, upon Monday, December 20, his remains were deposited in that noble and renowned edifice; and over his grave was placed a large blue flag-stone, with this inscription: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL.D.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obiit XIII die Decembris,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anno Domini</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;M.DCC.LXXXIV.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aetatis suae LXXV.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">His funeral was attended by a respectable number of his friends, particularly such of the members of the LITERARY CLUB as were then in town; and was also honoured with the presence of several of the Reverend Chapter of Westminster. Mr. Burke, Sir Joseph Banks, Mr. Windham, Mr. Langton, Sir Charles Bunbury, and Mr. Colman, bore his pall. His school-fellow, Dr. Taylor, performed the mournful office of reading the burial service.</p>
<p class="p24">I trust, I shall not be accused of affectation, when I declare, that I find myself unable to express all that I felt upon the loss of such a &lsquo;Guide, Philosopher, and Friend.&rsquo; I shall, therefore, not say one word of my own, but adopt those of an eminent friend, which he uttered with an abrupt felicity, superior to all studied compositions:&mdash; &lsquo;He has made a chasm, which not only nothing can fill up, but which nothing has a tendency to fill up. Johnson is dead. Let us go to the next best: &mdash; there is nobody; no man can be said to put you in mind of Johnson.&rsquo;</p>
