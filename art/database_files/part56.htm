These large bodies of information do not exist in isolation. They are part of the operation of some enterprise whose end product may be information from the database or may be some device or service for which the database plays only a supporting role.</p><p style="padding-left: 119pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">Database design mainly involves the design of the database schema. The design of a complete database application environment that meets the needs of the enterprise being modeled requires attention to a broader set of issues. In this text, we focus on the writing of database queries and the design of database schemas, but discuss application design later, in Chapter 9.</p><p style="padding-left: 119pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: right;">A high-level data model provides the database designer with a conceptual frame- work in which to specify the data requirements of the database users and how the database will be structured to fulﬁll these requirements. The initial phase of database design, then, is to characterize fully the data needs of the prospective database users. The database designer needs to interact extensively with domain experts and users to carry out this task. The outcome of this phase is a speciﬁcation of user requirements. Next, the designer chooses a data model, and by applying the concepts of the cho-</p><p style="padding-left: 119pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">sen data model, translates these requirements into a conceptual schema of the database. The schema developed at this <span class="s63">conceptual-design </span>phase provides a detailed overview of the enterprise. The designer reviews the schema to conﬁrm that all data requirements are indeed satisﬁed and are not in conﬂict with one another. The designer can also examine the design to remove any redundant features. The focus at this point is on describing the data and their relationships, rather than on specifying physical storage details.</p><p style="padding-left: 119pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">In terms of the relational model, the conceptual-design process involves decisions on <i>what </i>attributes we want to capture in the database and <i>how to group </i>these attributes to form the various tables. The “what” part is basically a business decision, and we shall not discuss it further in this text. The “how” part is mainly a computer-science problem. There are principally two ways to tackle the problem. The ﬁrst one is to use the entity-relationship model (Chapter 6); the other is to employ a set of algorithms (collectively known as <span class="s63">normalization </span>that takes as input the set of all attributes and generates a set of tables (Chapter 7).</p><p style="padding-left: 119pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">A fully developed conceptual schema indicates the functional requirements of the enterprise. In a <span class="s63">speciﬁcation of functional requirements</span>, users describe the kinds of oper-</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 88pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark14">ations (or transactions) that will be performed on the data. Example operations include modifying or updating data, searching for and retrieving speciﬁc data, and deleting data. At this stage of conceptual design, the designer can review the schema to ensure it meets functional requirements.</a><a name="bookmark26">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="padding-left: 88pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">The process of moving from an abstract data model to the implementation of the database proceeds in two ﬁnal design phases. In the <span class="s63">logical-design phase</span>, the de- signer maps the high-level conceptual schema onto the implementation data model of the database system that will be used. The designer uses the resulting system-speciﬁc database schema in the subsequent <span class="s63">physical-design phase</span>, in which the physical features of the database are speciﬁed. These features include the form of ﬁle organization and the internal storage structures; they are discussed in Chapter 13.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part55.htm">&lt; 上一个</a><span> | </span><a href="../database.html">内容</a><span> | </span><a href="part57.htm">下一个 &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
