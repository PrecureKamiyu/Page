As we learned in <a class="xref" href="fileP7001011952000000000000000001442.xhtml#P7001011952000000000000000001442" data-foobar="7"><span class="label">Section</span> <span class="number">3.5</span></a>, TCP provides a reliable transport service between two processes running on different hosts. Another key component of TCP is its congestion-control mechanism. As indicated in the previous section, TCP must use end-to-end congestion control rather than network-assisted congestion control, since the IP layer provides no explicit feedback to the end systems regarding network congestion.</p>

If a TCP sender perceives that there is little congestion on the path between itself and the destination, then the TCP sender increases its send rate; if the sender perceives that there is congestion along the path, then the sender reduces its send rate. But this approach raises three questions. First, how does a TCP sender limit the rate at which it sends traffic into its connection? Second, how does a TCP sender perceive that there is congestion on the path between itself and the destination? And third, what algorithm should the sender use to change its send rate as a function of perceived end-to-end congestion?</p>

Let us define a “loss event” at a TCP sender as the occurrence of either a timeout or the receipt of three duplicate ACKs from the receiver. (Recall our discussion in <a class="xref" href="fileP7001011952000000000000000001442.xhtml#P700101195200000000000000000152A" data-foobar="7"><span class="label">Section</span> <span class="number">3.5.4</span></a> of the timeout event in <a class="xref" href="fileP7001011952000000000000000001442.xhtml#P7001011952000000000000000001533" data-foobar="7"><span class="label">Figure</span> <span class="number">3.33</span></a> and the subsequent modification to include fast retransmit on receipt of three duplicate ACKs.) When there is excessive congestion, then one (or more) router buffers along the path overflows, causing a datagram (containing a TCP segment) to be dropped. The dropped datagram, in turn, results in a loss event at the sender—either a timeout or the receipt of three duplicate ACKs—which is taken by the sender to be an indication of congestion on the sender-to-receiver path.</p>
<p id="P700101195200000000000000000A506" data-uri="M03_KURO4140_07_SE_C03.xhtml#P700101195200000000000000000A506">Having considered how congestion is detected, let’s next consider the more optimistic case when the network is congestion-free, that is, when a loss event doesn’t occur. In this case, acknowledgments for previously unacknowledged segments will be received at the TCP sender. As we’ll see, TCP will take the arrival of these acknowledgments as an indication that all is well—that segments being transmitted into the network are being successfully delivered to the destination—and will use acknowledgments to increase its congestion window size (and hence its transmission rate). Note that if acknowledgments arrive at a relatively slow rate (e.g., if the end-end path has high delay or contains a low-bandwidth link), then the congestion window will be increased at a relatively slow rate. On the other hand, if acknowledgments arrive at a high rate, then the congestion window will be increased more quickly. Because TCP uses acknowledgments to trigger (or clock) its increase in congestion window size, TCP is said to be <span class="keyword" id="P70010119520000000000000000016A4" data-uri="M03_KURO4140_07_SE_C03.xhtml#P70010119520000000000000000016A4"><b>self-clocking</b></span>.</p>

If TCP senders collectively send too fast, they can congest the network, leading to the type of congestion collapse that we saw in <a class="xref" href="fileP7001011952000000000000000001627.xhtml#P7001011952000000000000000001672" data-foobar="7"><span class="label">Figure</span> <span class="number">3.48</span></a>. Indeed, the version of TCP that we’ll study shortly was developed in response to observed Internet congestion collapse <a class="biblioref" href="fileP70010119520000000000000000037E0.xhtml#P70010119520000000000000000039B2" data-foobar="7">[Jacobson 1988]</a> under earlier versions of TCP. However, if TCP senders are too cautious and send too slowly, they could under utilize the bandwidth in the network; that is, the TCP senders could send at a higher rate without congesting the network. How then do the TCP senders determine their sending rates such that they don’t congest the network but at the same time make use of all the available bandwidth? Are TCP senders explicitly coordinated, or is there a distributed approach in which the TCP senders can set their sending rates based only on local information? TCP answers these questions using the following guiding principles:</p>

The TCP sender thus increases its transmission rate to probe for the rate that at which congestion onset begins, backs off from that rate, and then to begins probing again to see if the congestion onset rate has changed. The TCP sender’s behavior is perhaps analogous to the child who requests (and gets) more and more goodies until finally he/she is finally told “No!”, backs off a bit, but then begins making requests again shortly afterwards. Note that there is no explicit signaling of congestion state by the network—ACKs and loss events serve as implicit signals—and that each TCP sender acts on local information asynchronously from other TCP senders.</p></li>

When this acknowledgment arrives, the TCP sender increases the congestion window by one MSS and sends out two maximum-sized segments. These segments are then acknowledged, with the sender increasing the congestion window by 1 MSS for each of the acknowledged segments, giving a congestion window of 4 MSS, and so on. This process results in a doubling of the sending rate every RTT. Thus, the TCP send rate starts slow but grows exponentially during the slow start phase.</p>

Slow start provides several answers to this question. First, if there is a loss event (i.e., congestion) indicated by a timeout, the TCP sender sets the value of <code id="P700101195200000000000000000A51E" data-uri="M03_KURO4140_07_SE_C03.xhtml#P700101195200000000000000000A51E">cwnd</code> to 1 and begins the slow start process anew.

This can be a major challenge, as users are often located far away from the data centers responsible for serving the dynamic content associated with the cloud services. Indeed, if the end system is far from a data center, then the RTT will be large, potentially leading to poor response time performance due to TCP slow start.</p>

In this analysis we’ll ignore the slow-start phases that occur after timeout events. (These phases are typically very short, since the sender grows out of the phase exponentially fast.) During a particular round-trip interval, the rate at which TCP sends data is a function of the congestion window and the current <i>RTT</i>. When the window size is <i>w</i> bytes and the current round-trip time is <i>RTT</i> second<i>s</i>, then TCP’s transmission rate is roughly <i>w/RTT.</i> TCP then probes for additional bandwidth by increasing <i>w</i> by 1 MSS each <i>RTT</i> until a loss event occurs. Denote by <i>W</i> the value of <i>w</i> when a loss event occurs. Assuming that <i>RTT</i> and <i>W</i> are approximately constant over the duration of the connection, the TCP transmission rate ranges from <i>W</i>/(2 · <i>RTT</i>) to <i>W/RTT</i>.</p>

The network drops a packet from the connection when the rate increases to <i>W/RTT;</i> the rate is then cut in half and then increases by MSS/<i>RTT</i> every <i>RTT</i> until it again reaches <i>W/RTT</i>. This process repeats itself over and over again. Because TCP’s throughput (that is, rate) increases linearly between the two extreme values, we have</p>

Instead, these applications prefer to run over UDP, which does not <span class="pagebreak" title="282" id="P700101195200000000000000000175E" data-uri="M03_KURO4140_07_SE_C03.xhtml#P700101195200000000000000000175E" epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>have built-in congestion control. When running over UDP, applications can pump their audio and video into the network at a constant rate and occasionally lose packets, rather than reduce their rates to “fair” levels at times of congestion and not lose any packets. From the perspective of TCP, the multimedia applications running over UDP are not being fair—they do not cooperate with the other connections nor adjust their transmission rates appropriately. Because TCP congestion control will decrease its transmission rate in the face of increasing congestion (loss), while UDP sources need not, it is possible for UDP sources to crowd out TCP traffic. An area of research today is thus the development of congestion-control mechanisms for the Internet that prevent UDP traffic from bringing the Internet’s throughput to a grinding halt <a class="biblioref" href="fileP70010119520000000000000000037E0.xhtml#P7001011952000000000000000003900" data-foobar="7">[Floyd 1999</a>; <a class="biblioref" href="fileP70010119520000000000000000037E0.xhtml#P7001011952000000000000000003902" data-foobar="7">Floyd 2000</a>; <a class="biblioref" href="fileP70010119520000000000000000037E0.xhtml#P70010119520000000000000000039F2" data-foobar="7">Kohler 2006</a>; <a class="biblioref" href="fileP70010119520000000000000000037E0.xhtml#P7001011952000000000000000003B98" data-foobar="7">RFC 4340]</a>.</p>

This is because there is nothing to stop a TCP-based application from using multiple parallel connections. For example, Web browsers often use multiple parallel TCP connections to transfer the multiple objects within a Web page. (The exact number of multiple connections is configurable in most browsers.) When an application uses multiple parallel connections, it gets a larger fraction of the bandwidth in a congested link. As an example, consider a link of rate <i>R</i> supporting nine ongoing client-server applications, with each of the applications using one TCP connection. If a new application comes along and also uses one TCP connection, then each application gets approximately the same transmission rate of <i>R</i>/10. But if this new application instead uses 11 parallel TCP connections, then the new application gets an unfair allocation of more than <i>R</i>/2. Because Web traffic is so pervasive in the Internet, multiple parallel connections are not uncommon.</p>

This congestion indication is then carried in the marked IP datagram to the destination host, which then informs the sending host, as shown in <a class="xref" href="#P7001011952000000000000000001768" data-foobar="1"><span class="label">Figure</span> <span class="number">3.56</span></a>. RFC 3168 does not provide a definition of when a router is congested; that decision is a configuration choice made possible by the router vendor, and decided by the network operator. However, RFC 3168 does recommend that an ECN congestion indication be set only in the face of persistent congestion. A second setting of the ECN bits is used by the sending host to inform routers that the sender and receiver are ECN-capable, and thus capable of taking action in response to ECN-indicated network congestion.</p>
