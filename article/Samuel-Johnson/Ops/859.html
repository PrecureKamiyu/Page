<p class="p26">When learning&rsquo;s triumph o&rsquo;er her barb&rsquo;rous foes<br/>First rear&rsquo;d the stage, immortal Shakespeare rose;<br/>Each change of many-colour&rsquo;d life he drew,<br/>Exhausted worlds, and then imagin&rsquo;d new:<br/>Existence saw him spurn her bounded reign,<br/>And panting time toil&rsquo;d after him in vain:<br/>His pow&rsquo;rful strokes presiding truth impress&rsquo;d,<br/>And unresisted passion storm&rsquo;d the breast.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Jonson came, instructed from the school<br/>To please in method, and invent by rule;<br/>His studious patience and laborious art,<br/>By regular approach, assail&rsquo;d the heart:<br/>Cold approbation gave the ling&rsquo;ring bays;<br/>For those, who durst not censure, scarce could praise:<br/>A mortal born, he met the gen&rsquo;ral doom,<br/>But left, like Egypt&rsquo;s kings, a lasting tomb.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;The wits of Charles found easier ways to fame,<br/>Nor wish&rsquo;d for Jonson&rsquo;s art, or Shakespeare&rsquo;s flame:<br/>Themselves they studied, as they felt, they writ;<br/>Intrigue was plot, obscenity was wit;<br/>Vice always found a sympathetick friend;<br/>They pleas&rsquo;d their age, and did not aim to mend.<br/>Yet bards, like these, aspir&rsquo;d to lasting praise,<br/>And proudly hop&rsquo;d to pimp in future days.<br/>Their cause was gen&rsquo;ral, their supports were strong;<br/>Their slaves were willing, and their reign was long:<br/>Till shame regain&rsquo;d the post that sense betray&rsquo;d,<br/>And virtue call&rsquo;d oblivion to her aid.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, crush&rsquo;d by rules, and weaken&rsquo;d, as refin&rsquo;d,<br/>For years the pow&rsquo;r of tragedy declin&rsquo;d;<br/>From bard to bard the frigid caution crept,<br/>Till declamation roar&rsquo;d, while passion slept;<br/>Yet still did virtue deign the stage to tread,<br/>Philosophy remain&rsquo;d, though nature fled.<br/>But forced, at length, her ancient reign to quit,<br/>She saw great Faustus lay the ghost of wit;<br/>Exulting folly hail&rsquo;d the joyful day,<br/>And pantomime and song confirm&rsquo;d her sway.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;But who the coming changes can presage,<br/>And mark the future periods of the stage?<br/>Perhaps, if skill could distant times explore,<br/>New Behns, new Durfeys, yet remain in store;<br/>Perhaps, where Lear has ray&rsquo;d, and Hamlet dy&rsquo;d,<br/>On flying cars new sorcerers may ride:<br/>Perhaps, (for who can guess th&rsquo; effects of chance?)<br/>Here Hunt may box, or Mahomet may dance.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Hard is his lot that, here by fortune plac&rsquo;d,<br/>Must watch the wild vicissitudes of taste;<br/>With ev&rsquo;ry meteor of caprice must play,<br/>And chase the new-blown bubbles of the day.<br/>Ah! let not censure term our fate our choice,<br/>The stage but echoes back the publick voice;<br/>The drama&rsquo;s laws the drama&rsquo;s patrons give,<br/>For we that live to please, must please to live.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Then prompt no more the follies you decry,<br/>As tyrants doom their tools of guilt to die;<br/>&rsquo;Tis yours, this night, to bid the reign commence<br/>Of rescued nature and reviving sense;<br/>To chase the charms of sound, the pomp of show,<br/>For useful mirth and salutary woe;<br/>Bid scenick virtue form the rising age,<br/>And truth diffuse her radiance from the stage.</p>
