<p class="p26">Oft in danger, yet alive,<br/>We are come to thirty-five;<br/>Long may better years arrive,<br/>Better years than thirty-five!<br/>Could philosophers contrive<br/>Life to stop at thirty-five,<br/>Time his hours should never drive<br/>O&rsquo;er the bounds of thirty-five.<br/>High to soar, and deep to dive,<br/>Nature gives at thirty-five.<br/>Ladies, stock and tend your hive,<br/>Trifle not at thirty-five;<br/>For, howe&rsquo;er we boast and strive.<br/>Life declines from thirty-five.<br/>He that ever hopes to thrive<br/>Must begin by thirty-five;<br/>And all, who wisely wish to wive,<br/>Must look on Thrale at thirty-five.</p>
