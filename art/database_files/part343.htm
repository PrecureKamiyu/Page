[Bernstein and Newcomer (2009)] provides textbook coverage of various aspects of transaction processing including concurrency control.</p><p style="padding-left: 88pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">The two-phase locking protocol was introduced by [Eswaran et al. (1976)]. The locking protocol for multiple-granularity data items is from [Gray et al. (1975)]. The timestamp-based concurrency-control scheme is from [Reed (1983)]. The validation concurrency-control scheme is from [Kung and Robinson (1981)]. Multiversion times- tamp order was introduced in [Reed (1983)]. A multiversion tree-locking algorithm appears in [Silberschatz (1982)].</p><p style="padding-left: 88pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: right;">Degree-two consistency was introduced in [Gray et al. (1975)]. The levels of con- sistency— or isolation— oﬀered in <span class="s44">SQL </span>are explained and critiqued in [Berenson et al. (1995)]; the snapshot isolation technique was also introduced in the same paper. Seri- alizable snapshot-isolation was introduced by [Cahill et al. (2009)]; [Ports and Grittner (2012)] describes the implementation of serializable snapshot isolation in <span class="s44">P</span>ostgre<span class="s44">SQL</span>. Concurrency in B<span class="s181">+</span>-trees was studied by [Bayer and Schkolnick (1977)] and [John- son and Shasha (1993)]. The crabbing and B-link tree techniques were introduced by [Kung and Lehman (1980)] and [Lehman and Yao (1981)]. The technique of key-value locking used in <span class="s44">ARIES </span>provides for very high concurrency on B<span class="s181">+</span>-tree access and is de-</p><p class="s64" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 119pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;">Further Reading  <span class="s164">905</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 119pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">scribed in [Mohan (1990)] and [Mohan and Narang (1992)]. [Faerber et al. (2017)] provide a survey of main-memory databases, including coverage of concurrency con- trol in main-memory databases. The ABA problem with latch-free data structures as well as solutions for the problem are discussed in [Dechev et al. (2010)].</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part342.htm">&lt; 上一个</a><span> | </span><a href="../database.html">内容</a><span> | </span><a href="part344.htm">下一个 &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
