Each computer is assigned an IP address. On the left, the top computer's IP address is 223.1.1.1, the middle computer's IP address is 223.1.1.2, and the bottom computer's IP address is 223.1.1.3. These three hosts are connected to a cloud, and the cloud connects to the central router. This connection is assigned its own IP address, which is 223.1.1.4.</p><p id="P700101195200000000000000000A8BE" data-uri="M04_KURO4140_07_SE_C04.xhtml#P700101195200000000000000000A8BE">On the right, the to computer's IP address is 223.1.2.1 and the bottom computer's IP address is 223.1.2.2.
