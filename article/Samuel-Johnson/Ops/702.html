<h2 class="h20"><a id="a1696"></a>COLLINS.</h2>
<p class="p21">William Collins was born at Chichester, on the th of December, about 1720. His father was a hatter of good reputation. He was, in 1733, as Dr. Warton has kindly informed me, admitted scholar of Winchester college, where he was educated by Dr. Burton. His English exercises were better than his Latin.</p>
<p class="p24">He first courted the notice of the publick by some verses to a Lady Weeping, published in the Gentleman&rsquo;s Magazine.</p>
<p class="p24">In 1740, he stood first in the list of the scholars to received in succession at New college, but unhappily there was no vacancy. This was the original misfortune of his life. He became a commoner of Queen&rsquo;s college, probably with a scanty maintenance; but was, in about half a year, elected a demy of Magdalen college, where he continued till he had taken a bachelor&rsquo;s degree, and then suddenly left the university; for what reason I know not that he told.</p>
<p class="p24">He now, about 1744, came to London a literary adventurer, with many projects in his head, and very little money in his pocket. He designed many works; but his great fault was irresolution; or the frequent calls of immediate necessity broke his schemes, and suffered him to pursue no settled purpose. A man doubtful of his dinner, or trembling at a creditor, is not much disposed to abstracted meditation, or remote inquires. He published proposals for a History of the Revival of Learning; and I have heard him speak with great kindness of Leo the tenth, and with keen resentment of his tasteless successour. But probably not a page of the history was ever written. He planned several tragedies, but he only planned them. He wrote now and then odes and other poems, and did something, however little.</p>
<p class="p24">About this time I fell into his company. His appearance was decent and manly; his knowledge considerable, his views extensive, his conversation elegant, and his disposition cheerful. By degrees I gained his confidence; and one day was admitted to him when he was immured by a bailiff, that was prowling in the street. On this occasion recourse was had to the booksellers, who, on the credit of a translation of Aristotle&rsquo;s Poeticks, which he engaged to write with a large commentary, advanced as much money as enabled him to escape into the country. He showed me the guineas safe in his hand. Soon afterwards his uncle, Mr. Martin, a lieutenant-colonel, left him about two thousand pounds; a sum which Collins could scarcely think exhaustible, and which he did not live to exhaust. The guineas were then repaid, and the translation neglected.</p>
<p class="p24">But man is not born for happiness. Collins, who, while he <span class="t8">studied to live</span>, felt no evil but poverty, no sooner <span class="t8">lived to study</span> than his life was assailed by more dreadful calamities, disease and insanity.</p>
<p class="p24"><a id="a1697"></a>Having formerly written his character, while, perhaps, it was yet more distinctly impressed upon my memory, I shall insert it here.</p>
<p class="p20">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p24">&ldquo;Mr. Collins was a man of extensive literature, and of vigorous faculties. He was acquainted not only with the learned tongues, but with the Italian, French, and Spanish languages. He had employed his mind chiefly upon works of fiction, and subjects of fancy; and, by indulging some peculiar habits of thought, was eminently delighted with those flights of imagination which pass the bounds of nature, and to which the mind is reconciled only by a passive acquiescence in popular traditions. He loved fairies, genii, giants, and monsters; he delighted to rove through the meanders of enchantment, to gaze on the magnificence of golden palaces, to repose by the waterfalls of elysian gardens.</p>
<p class="p24">&ldquo;This was, however, the character rather of his inclination than his genius; the grandeur of wildness, and the novelty of extravagance, were always desired by him, but not always attained. Yet, as diligence is never wholly lost, if his efforts sometimes caused harshness and obscurity, they likewise produced, in happier moments, sublimity and splendour. This idea which he had formed of excellence, led him to oriental fictions and allegorical imagery, and, perhaps, while he was intent upon description, he did not sufficiently cultivate sentiment. His poems are the productions of a mind not deficient in fire, nor unfurnished with knowledge either of books or life, but somewhat obstructed in its progress by deviation in quest of mistaken beauties.</p>
<p class="p24">&ldquo;His morals were pure, and his opinions pious; in a long continuance of poverty, and long habits of dissipation, it cannot be expected that any character should be exactly uniform. There is a degree of want, by which the freedom of agency is almost destroyed; and long association with fortuitous companions will, at last, relax the strictness of truth, and abate the fervour of sincerity. That this man, wise and virtuous as he was, passed always unentangled through the snares of life, it would be prejudice and temerity to affirm; but it may be said that at least he preserved the source of action unpolluted, that his principles were never shaken, that his distinctions of right and wrong were never confounded, and that his faults had nothing of malignity or design, but proceeded from some unexpected pressure, or casual temptation.</p>
<p class="p24"><a id="a1698"></a>&ldquo;The latter part of his life cannot be remembered but with pity and sadness. He languished some years under that depression of mind which enchains the faculties without destroying them, and leaves reason the knowledge of right without the power of pursuing it. These clouds which he perceived gathering on his intellects, he endeavoured to disperse by travel, and passed into France; but found himself constrained to yield to his malady, and returned. He was, for some time, confined in a house of lunaticks, and afterwards retired to the care of his sister in Chichester, where death, in 1756, came to his relief.</p>
<p class="p24">&ldquo;After his return from France, the writer of this character paid him a visit at Islington, where he was waiting for his sister, whom he had directed to meet him: there was then nothing of disorder discernible in his mind by any but himself; but he had withdrawn from study, and travelled with no other book than an English testament, such as children carry to the school: when his friend took it into his hand, out of curiosity, to see what companion a man of letters had chosen, &lsquo;I have but one book,&rsquo; said Collins, &lsquo;but that is the best.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p24">Such was the fate of Collins, with whom I once delighted to converse, and whom I yet remember with tenderness.</p>
<p class="p24"><a id="a1699"></a>He was visited at Chichester, in his last illness, by his learned friends, Dr. Warton and his brother; to whom he spoke with disapprobation of his Oriental Eclogues, as not sufficiently expressive of Asiatick manners, and called them his Irish Eclogues. He showed them, at the same time, an ode inscribed to Mr. John Hume, on the superstitions of the Highlands; which they thought superiour to his other works, but which no search has yet found.</p>
<p class="p24">His disorder was not alienation of mind, but general laxity and feebleness, a deficiency rather of his vital than intellectual powers. What he spoke wanted neither judgment nor spirit; but a few minutes exhausted him, so that he was forced to rest upon the couch, till a short cessation restored his powers, and he was again able to talk with his former vigour.</p>
<p class="p24">The approaches of this dreadful malady he began to feel soon after his uncle&rsquo;s death; and, with the usual weakness of men so diseased, eagerly snatched that temporary relief, with which the table and the bottle flatter and seduce.</p>
<p class="p24">But his health continually declined, and he grew more and more burdensome to himself.</p>
<p class="p24">To what I have formerly said of his writings may be added, that his diction was often harsh, unskilfully laboured, and injudiciously selected. He affected the obsolete when it was not worthy of revival; and he puts his words out of the common order, seeming to think, with some later candidates for fame, that not to write prose is certainly to write poetry. His lines commonly are of slow motion, clogged and impeded with clusters of consonants. As men are often esteemed who cannot be loved, so the poetry of Collins may, sometimes, extort praise when it gives little pleasure.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p24">Mr. Collins&rsquo;s first production is added here from the Poetical Calendar.</p>
<p class="p26">TO MISS AURELIA C &mdash;&mdash; R,<br/>ON HER WEEPING AT HER SISTER&rsquo;S WEDDING. </p>
<p class="p26">Cease, fair Aurelia, cease to mourn;<br/>Lament not Hannah&rsquo;s happy state;<br/>You may be happy in your turn,<br/>And seize the treasure you regret.</p>
<p class="p26">With love united hymen stands,<br/>And softly whispers to your charms,<br/>&ldquo;Meet but your lover in my bands,<br/>You&rsquo;ll find your sister in his arms.&rdquo;</p>
