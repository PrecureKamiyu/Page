From left to right, we see: three arrows pointing rightward, positioned one on top of another. These arrows are labeled "Classify Arrivals." These arrows arrive at an unlabeled triangle and the data splits into three separate queues. The top queue contains four white bars and four light blue bars; the middle queue contains six white bars and two light blue bars; and the bottom queue contains four white bars and four light blue bars. The data leaves its respective queue and all streams arrive at a circle labeled "Link." The three streams are each labeled-the top stream is labeled "W1," the middle is labeled "W2," and the bottom is labeled "W3." A blue arrow indicates that W1 is considered first, W2 is considered second, W3 is considered third, and then the arrow loops back around to W1 again. The data leaves the link as a single line that becomes three arrows pointing rightward. These arrows are labeled "Departures."</p></div></section></body></html>
