<p class="p26">Bright Stella, form&rsquo;d for universal reign,<br/>Too well you know to keep the slaves you gain;<br/>When in your eyes resistless lightnings play,<br/>Aw&rsquo;d into love our conquer&rsquo;d hearts obey,<br/>And yield reluctant to despotick sway:<br/>But, when your musick sooths the raging pain,<br/>We bid propitious heav&rsquo;n prolong your reign,<br/>We bless the tyrant, and we hug the chain.<br/>When old Timotheus struck the vocal string,<br/>Ambition&rsquo;s fury fir&rsquo;d the Grecian king:<br/>Unbounded projects lab&rsquo;ring in his mind,<br/>He pants for room, in one poor world confin&rsquo;d.<br/>Thus wak&rsquo;d to rage, by musick&rsquo;s dreadful pow&rsquo;r,<br/>He bids the sword destroy, the flame devour.<br/>Had Stella&rsquo;s gentle touches mov&rsquo;d the lyre,<br/>Soon had the monarch felt a nobler fire;<br/>No more delighted with destructive war,<br/>Ambitious only now to please the fair,<br/>Resign&rsquo;d his thirst of empire to her charms,<br/>And found a thousand worlds in Stella&rsquo;s arms.</p>
<p class="p26">&nbsp;These lines, which have been communicated by Dr. Turton, son to Mrs.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turton, the lady to whom they are addressed by her maiden name of<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hickman, must have been written, at least, as early as 1734, as that<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was the year of her marriage: at how much earlier a period of Dr.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Johnson&rsquo;s life they might have been written, is not known.</p>
