The following statements are equivalent. 

1. \(N\) is the normal subgroup of \(G\)
2. \(\forall g (g N =  N g)\)
3. \( N _{G} (N) = G\)
4. 每一个 \(N\) 的 right coset 都是 left coset, that is 
\[
\forall g \exists g ' ( gN  = N g')
\]
需要结论: if \( g \in N g'\) then \( N g = N g'\).

Thm 1. 

\(f\) is a homo. then \(\ker f\) is a subgroup of \(G\) and \(\text{Im}\, f\) is a subgroup of \(G'\). 
And \(\bar f\) defined as \( G /\ker f \to \text{Im}\, f\), \( \bar g \mapsto f(g)\), is an iso.

Proof. Prove \(\bar f\) is homo, that is to prove \(\bar f ( \overline{a b}	) = \bar f (\bar a) \bar f (\bar b)\). 
prove that \(\bar f\) is onto and one-one. one-one is trivial. Onto is also trivial. 

Example. \(\mathbb{Z} / n\mathbb{Z}\) is iso to \( \mathbb{Z}_{n}\)
Example. \(\text{det}\) is a map from the general linear group \(\text{GL}\, (n , \mathbb{C})\)to \(\mathbb{C} ^{*}\). 
\(\text{det}\) is a homo. \(\ker f\) is \( \text{SL}\, (n , \mathbb{C})\). So \( \text{GL} (n , \mathbb{C}) / \text{SL}(n, \mathbb{C})\) is iso to \(\mathbb{C} ^{*}\)
