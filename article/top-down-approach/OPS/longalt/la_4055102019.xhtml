The interactions are numbered to correspond with the preceding text.</p><p id="P7001011952000000000000000009D42" data-uri="M02_KURO4140_07_SE_C02.xhtml#P7001011952000000000000000009D42">The interaction begins with a desktop computer labeled "Requesting host, cse.nyu.edu." The initial request is made and labeled as "1," and here is depicted as a blue arrow pointing vertically upwards to a server labeled "Local DNS server, dns.nyu.edu." Interaction 2 is depicted as an arrow pointing diagonally upward and to the right, to a server labeled "Root DNS server." Interaction 3 is depicted as an arrow pointing back to the Local DNS server, dns.nyu.edu. Interaction 4 is depicted as an arrow pointing vertically to the right, towards a server labeled "TLD DNS server." Interaction 5 is depicted as an arrow pointing back to the Local DNS server, dns.nyu.edu. Interaction 6 is depicted as an arrow pointing horizontally down and to the right, to a server labeled "Authoritative DNS server, dns.umass.edu." Beneath this is a desktop computer labeled "gaia.cs.umass.edu." Interaction 7 is depicted as an arrow pointing back to the Local DNS server, dns.nyu.edu." And interaction 8 is depicted as an arrow pointing vertically downward from the Local DNS server to the original Requesting host, cse.nyu.edu.</p></div></section></body></html>
