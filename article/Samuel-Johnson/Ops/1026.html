<h2 class="h20"><a id="ncx51200"></a>I. AN INTRODUCTION TO MACAULAY. (1800-1859)</h2>
<p class="p21">Before Thomas Babington Macaulay was big enough to hold a large volume he used to lie on the rug by the open fire, with his book on the floor and a piece of bread and butter in his hand. Apparently the three-year-old boy was as fond of reading as of eating, and even at this time he showed that he was no mere bookworm by sharing with the maid what he had learned from &ldquo;a volume as big as himself.&rdquo; He never tired of telling the stories that he read, and as he easily remembered the words of the book he rapidly acquired a somewhat astonishing vocabulary for a boy of his years. One afternoon when the little fellow, then aged four, was visiting, a servant spilled some hot coffee on his legs. The hostess, who was very sympathetic, soon afterward asked how he was feeling. He looked up in her face and replied, &ldquo;Thank you, madam, the agony is abated.&rdquo; It was at this same period of his infancy that he had a little plot of ground of his own, marked out by a row of oyster shells, which a maid one day threw away as rubbish. &ldquo;He went straight to the drawing-room, where his mother was entertaining some visitors, walked into the circle, and said, very solemnly, &lsquo;Cursed be Sally; for it is written, Cursed is he that removeth his neighbor&rsquo;s landmark.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">As these incidents indicate, the youngster was precocious. When he was seven, his mother writes, he wrote a compendium of universal history, and &ldquo;really contrived to give a tolerably connected view of the leading events from the Creation to the present time, filling about a quire of paper.&rdquo; Yet, fond as he was of reading, he was &ldquo;as playful as a kitten.&rdquo; Although he made wonderful progress in all branches of his education, he had to be driven to school. Again and again his entreaty to be allowed to stay at home met his mother&rsquo;s &ldquo;No, Tom, if it rains cats and dogs, you shall go.&rdquo; The boy thought he was too busy with his literary activities to waste time in school; but the father and mother looked upon his productions merely as schoolboy amusements. He was to be treated like other boys, and no suspicion was to come to him, if they could help it, that he was superior to other children.</p>
<p class="p24">The wise parents had set themselves no easy task in their determination to pay little attention to the unusual gifts of this lad. One afternoon, when a child, he went with his father to make a social call, and found on the table the <span class="t8">Lay of the Last Minstrel</span>, which he had never before seen. While the others talked he quietly read, and on reaching home recited as many stanzas as his mother had the patience or the strength to hear. Clearly a boy who had read incessantly from the time he was three years old, who committed to memory as rapidly as most boys read, and who was eager to declaim poetry by the hour, or to tell interminable stories of his own, would attract somebody&rsquo;s attention. Fortunately for all concerned the lady who was particularly interested in him, and who had him at her house for weeks at a time, Mrs. Hannah More, encouraged without spoiling him, and rewarded him by buying books to increase his library. When he was six or eight years old, she gave him a small sum with which to lay &ldquo;a corner-stone&rdquo; for his library, and a year or two afterward she wrote that he was entitled to another book: &ldquo;What say you to a little good prose? Johnson&rsquo;s &lsquo;Hebrides,&rsquo; or Walton&rsquo;s &lsquo;Lives,&rsquo; unless you would like a neat edition of &lsquo;Cowper&rsquo;s Poems,&rsquo; or &lsquo;Paradise Lost,&rsquo; for your own eating?&rdquo; Whether he began at once to eat Milton&rsquo;s great epic we are not told, but at a later period he said that &ldquo;if by some miracle of vandalism all copies of &lsquo;Paradise Lost&rsquo; and &lsquo;The Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress&rsquo; were destroyed off the face of the earth, he would undertake to reproduce them both from recollection.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Prodigy though he was, Thomas was more than a reader and reciter of books. Much as he cared for them he cared more for his home, &mdash; that simple, thrifty, comfortable home, &mdash; and his three brothers and five sisters. His father, Zachary, did a large business as an African merchant. This earnest, precise, austere man was so anxious for his eldest son to have a thoroughly trained mind that he expected a deliberation and a maturity of judgment that are not natural to an impetuous lad. The good-natured, open-hearted boy reasoned with him and pleaded with him, and whether successful or not in persuading his father, loved him just the same. The mother, with all her love and ambition for him, took the utmost pains to teach him to do thoroughly whatever he undertook, in order that he might attain the perfect development of character that comes alone from the most vigorous training. His sister, Lady Trevelyan, writes: &ldquo;His unruffled sweetness of temper, his unfailing flow of spirits, his amusing talk, all made his presence so delightful that his wishes and his tastes were our law. He hated strangers and his notion of perfect happiness was to see us all working round him while he read aloud a novel, and then to walk all together on the Common, or, if it rained, to have a frightfully noisy game of hide-and-seek.&rdquo; It was a habit in the family to read aloud every evening from such writers as Shakspere, Clarendon, Miss Edgeworth, Scott, and Crabbe; and, as a standing dish, the <span class="t8">Quarterly</span> and the <span class="t8">Edinburgh Review</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">From this home, in which he was wisely loved, Thomas was sent to a private school near Cambridge. Then his troubles began. The twelve-year-old boy longed for the one attraction that would tempt him from his books &mdash; home life &mdash; and months ahead he counted the days which must pass before he could again see the home &ldquo;which absence renders still dearer.&rdquo; In August, 1813, he urged his mother for permission to go home on his birthday, October 25: &ldquo;If your approbation of my request depends upon my advancing in study, I will work like a cart-horse. If you should refuse it, you will deprive me of the most pleasing illusion which I ever experienced in my life.&rdquo; But the father shook his head and the boy toiled on with his Greek and Latin. He wrote of learning the Greek grammar by heart, he tried his hand at Latin verses, and he read what he pleased, with a preference for prose fiction and poetry.</p>
<p class="p24">When eighteen years old (in October, 1818), Macaulay entered Trinity College, Cambridge. But for mathematics he would have been made happy. He writes to his mother: &ldquo;Oh for words to express my abomination of that science, if a name sacred to the useful and embellishing arts may be applied to the perception and recollection of certain properties in numbers and figures!... &lsquo;Discipline&rsquo; of the mind! Say rather starvation, confinement, torture, annihilation!&rdquo; There were prizes, but Macaulay was not a prize winner. He was an excellent declaimer and an excellent debater, and undoubtedly might have won more honors had he been willing to work hard on the subjects prescribed, whether he liked them or not. But he was eager to avoid the sciences, and he was not content to be a mere struggler for honors. He was sensible enough to enjoy the companionships the place afforded. He knew something of the value of choosing comrades after his own heart, who were thoroughly genuine and sincere, natural and manly. Even if, as Mr. Morison says, the result of his college course was that &ldquo;those faculties which were naturally strong were made stronger, and those which were naturally weak received little or no exercise,&rdquo; he wisely spent much time with a remarkable group of young men, among whom Charles Austin was king. Of Austin, John Stuart Mill says, &ldquo;The impression he gave was that of boundless strength, together with talents which, combined with such apparent force of will and character, seemed capable of dominating the world.&rdquo; And Trevelyan adds, &ldquo;He certainly was the only man who ever succeeded in dominating Macaulay.&rdquo; Austin it was who turned Zachary Macaulay&rsquo;s eldest son from a Tory into a Whig. The boy had always been interested in the political discussions held in his father&rsquo;s house, a center of consultation for suburban members of Parliament, and had learned to look at public affairs with no thought of ambition or jealous self-seeking. This sort of training, supplemented by his discussions at college, where he soon became a vigorous politician, developed a patriotic, disinterested man.</p>
<p class="p24">In the midst of his inexpressible delight in the freedom the college course gave him to indulge his fondness for literature and to spend his days and nights walking and talking with his mates, he continued to remember his family with affection, and did not neglect to write home. On March 25, 1821, he wrote his mother: &ldquo;I am sure that it is well worth while being sick to be nursed by a mother. There is nothing which I remember with such pleasure as the time when you nursed me at Aspenden. The other night, when I lay on my sofa very ill and hypochondriac, I was told that you were come! How well I remember with what an ecstasy of joy I saw that face approaching me, in the middle of people that did not care if I died that night, except for the trouble of burying me! The sound of your voice, the touch of your hand, are present to me now, and will be, I trust in God, to my last hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On the first of October, 1824, two years after he had received the degree of Bachelor of Arts, he wrote his father that he was that morning elected Fellow, and that the position would make him almost independent financially for the next seven years.</p>
<p class="p24">In 1824, too, he made his first address before a public assembly, &mdash; an antislavery address that probably gave Zachary Macaulay the happiest half hour of his life, that called out a &ldquo;whirlwind of cheers&rdquo; from the audience, and enthusiastic commendation from the <span class="t8">Edinburgh Review</span>. The next year Macaulay was asked to write for that famous periodical, then at the height of its political, social, and literary power. He contributed the essay on Milton and &ldquo;like Lord Byron he awoke one morning and found himself famous.&rdquo; The compliment for which he cared most&mdash; &ldquo;the only commendation of his literary talent which even in the innermost domestic circle he was ever known to repeat&rdquo; &mdash; came from Jeffrey, the editor, when he acknowledged the receipt of the manuscript: &ldquo;The more I think, the less I can conceive where you picked up that style.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">When Macaulay entered college, his father considered himself worth at least a hundred thousand pounds; but soon afterward he lost his money and the eldest son found the other children looking to him for guidance and support. As if it were the most natural thing in the world, he drew freely on his income from the fellowship and his occasional contributions to the <span class="t8">Edinburgh</span>. He was the sunshine of the home, and apparently only those who knew him there got the best of his brilliancy and wit.</p>
<p class="p24">In 1826 he was called to the bar, but he was becoming more and more interested in public affairs and longed to be in Parliament. In Lord Lansdowne, who had been much impressed by Macaulay&rsquo;s articles on Mill, and by his high moral and private character, gave him the opportunity to represent Calne&mdash; &ldquo;on the eve of the most momentous conflict,&rdquo; says Trevelyan, &ldquo;that ever was fought out by speech and vote within the walls of a senate-house.&rdquo; When the Reform Bill was introduced, the opposition laughed contemptuously at the impossibility of disfranchising, wholly or in part, a hundred and ten boroughs for the sake of securing a fair representation of the United Kingdom in the House of Commons. Two days later Macaulay made the first of his Reform speeches, and &ldquo;when he sat down, the Speaker sent for him, and told him that, in all his prolonged experience, he had never seen the House in such a state of excitement.&rdquo; That not only unsettled the House of Commons but put an end to the question whether he should give his time to law or to politics. During the next three years he devoted himself to Parliament. Entering with his whole soul into the thickest of the fight for reform, he made a speech on the second reading of the Reform Bill which no less a critic than Jeffrey said put him &ldquo;clearly at the head of the great speakers, if not the debaters, of the House.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Naturally the social advantages of the position appealed to Macaulay. He appreciated the freedom, the good fellowship, the spirit of equality among the members. &ldquo;For the space of three seasons he dined out almost nightly&rdquo;; and for a man who at a time when his parliamentary fame was highest, was so reduced that he sold the gold medals he had won at Cambridge, &mdash; though &ldquo;he was never for a moment in debt,&rdquo; &mdash; it was sometimes convenient to be a lion. Yet this &ldquo;sitting up in the House of Commons till three o&rsquo;clock five days in the week, and getting an indigestion at great dinners the remaining two,&rdquo; would not have been the first choice of a man whose greatest joy &ldquo;in the midst of all this praise&rdquo; was to think of the pleasure which his success would give to his father and his sisters.</p>
<p class="p24">In June, 1832, the bill which Macaulay had supported so zealously and so eloquently at every stage of the fight, finally became an act. As a reward the great orator was appointed a commissioner of the Board of Control, which represented the crown in its relations to the East Indian directors. He held this commissionership only eighteen months, however, for as a means of reducing expenses the Whig Government suppressed it. It is to Macaulay&rsquo;s everlasting credit that he voted for this economic measure at a time when his Trinity fellowship was about to expire, and when the removal from office left him penniless.</p>
<p class="p24">Impatient to choose the first Reformed Parliament, the great cities were looking about that autumn for worthy representatives. The Whigs of Leeds got Macaulay&rsquo;s promise to stand for that town as soon as it became a parliamentary borough. His attitude toward the electors whose votes meant bread to him was as refreshing as it was striking. His frank opinions they should have at all times, but pledges never. They should choose their representative cautiously and then confide in him liberally. Such independence was not relished in many quarters, but Macaulay answered the remonstrants with even more vigor: &ldquo;It is not necessary to my happiness that I should sit in Parliament; but it is necessary to my happiness that I should possess, in Parliament or out of Parliament, the consciousness of having done what is right.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">His appointment as Secretary to the Board of Control was a help financially, and his return to Parliament by Leeds proved to be of very great assistance. Matters were going smoothly when the Government introduced their Slavery Bill. To Zachary Macaulay, who had always been a zealous abolitionist, the measure was not satisfactory. To please him the son opposed it. In order that he might be free to criticise the bill, simply as a member of Parliament, he resigned his position in the Cabinet, although both he and his father thought this course of action would be fatal to his career. A son whose devotion to his father leads him to such lengths is not always so promptly rewarded as Macaulay was in this instance, for the resignation was not accepted, the bill was amended, and the Ministers were as friendly as ever.</p>
<p class="p24">Up to this time he had earned little money by his writing. After giving his days to India and his nights to improving the condition of the Treasury, he could get only snatches of time for turning off the essays which we read with so much care. With a family depending on him he now realized fully the need not of riches but of a competence. He could live by his pen or by office; but he could not think seriously of writing to &ldquo;relieve the emptiness of the pocket&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;the fullness of the mind,&rdquo; and if he must earn this competence through office, the sooner he was through with the business the better. So it was largely for the sake of his aged father, his younger brother, and his dearly loved sisters, that he accepted an appointment as legal adviser to the Supreme Council of India.</p>
<p class="p24">He and his sister Hannah sailed for India in February, 1834. He tells us that he read during the whole voyage: the <span class="t8">Iliad</span> and <span class="t8">Odyssey</span>, Virgil, Horace, Cæsar&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Commentaries</span>, Bacon&rsquo;s <span class="t8">De Augmentis</span>, Dante, Petrarch, Ariosto, Tasso, <span class="t8">Don Quixote</span>, Gibbon&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Rome</span>, Mill&rsquo;s <span class="t8">India</span>, all the seventy volumes of Voltaire, Sismondi&rsquo;s <span class="t8">History of France</span>, and the seven thick folios of the <span class="t8">Biographia Britannica</span>. On his arrival he plunged into the new work. Not satisfied with the immense amount already assigned him, he saw two large opportunities to do more by serving on two committees. As president of the Committee of Public Instruction he substituted for Oriental learning the introduction and promotion of European literature and science among the natives; as president of the Law Commission he took the initiative in framing the famous Penal Code, the value of which must be judged from the facts that &ldquo;hardly any questions have arisen upon it which have had to be determined by the courts, and that few and slight amendments have had to be made by the Legislature.&rdquo; He worked patiently, yet he longed to be back in England, and it was a great relief when in 1838, his work done, his competence saved, he was able to return. He was too late to see his father again, for Zachary Macaulay had died while the son was on the way home.</p>
<p class="p24">In the fall he went to Italy with his mind full of associations and traditions. His biographer says that every line of good poetry which the fame or the beauty of this country had inspired &ldquo;rose almost involuntarily to his lips.&rdquo; On this occasion he gave some of those geographical and topographical touches to the <span class="t8">Lays of Ancient Rome</span> &ldquo;which set his spirited stanzas ringing in the ear of a traveller in Rome at every turn.&rdquo; Much as he enjoyed Italy, he soon began to long for his regular work, and the following February found him in London again. In March he was unanimously elected to <span class="t8">the</span> Club, and he was making the most of his leisure for books when he felt it his duty to enter Parliament for Edinburgh. &ldquo;Office was never, within my memory, so little attractive,&rdquo; he writes, &ldquo;and therefore, I fear, I cannot, as a man of spirit, flinch, if it is offered to me.&rdquo; Without any show of reluctance he was made Secretary at War and given a seat in the Cabinet. To this position the man who had begun life &ldquo;without rank, fortune, or private interest&rdquo; had risen before his fortieth birthday. On March 14, 1840, he wrote his intimate friend, Mr. Ellis, a good account of his life at that time.</p>
<p class="p24">&ldquo;I have got through my estimates [for army expenses] with flying colors; made a long speech of figures and details without hesitation or mistake of any sort; stood catechising on all sorts of questions; and got six millions of public money in the course of an hour or two. I rather like the sort of work, and I have some aptitude for it. I find business pretty nearly enough to occupy all my time; and if I have a few minutes to myself, I spend them with my sister and niece; so that, except while I am dressing and undressing, I get no reading at all. I do not know but that it is as well for me to live thus for a time. I became too mere a bookworm in India, and on my voyage home. Exercise, they say, assists digestion; and it may be that some months of hard official and Parliamentary work may make my studies more nourishing.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">But the Queen&rsquo;s advisers did not have the confidence of the country, there was a change of government, and Macaulay lost his office. How the loss affected him we may gather from a part of his letter to Mr. Napier, at that time the editor of the <span class="t8">Edinburgh Review</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">&ldquo;I can truly say that I have not, for many years, been so happy as I am at present.... I am free. I am independent. I am in Parliament, as honorably seated as man can be. My family is comfortably off. I have leisure for literature, yet I am not reduced to the necessity of writing for money. If I had to choose a lot from all that there are in human life, I am not sure that I should prefer any to that which has fallen to me. I am sincerely and thoroughly contented.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Carlyle says that a biography should answer two questions: (1) what and how produced was the effect of society on the man; and (2) what and how produced was his effect on society. To the careful reader of Trevelyan&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Life</span> the words just quoted from Macaulay will give a pretty fair notion of what, up to this time, Macaulay had got from society. The other question, what he gave to society, is perhaps best answered in the account of the remaining years of his life. In Parliament, in society, and in literary and political circles throughout the country there was the feeling that he had won the respect and good will of all, and that he was to do something still greater. What this greater thing was to be was the question that confronted Macaulay for the next few years. Certainly it was not the publishing of his <span class="t8">Lays</span>, although one hundred thousand copies of them were sold by the year 1875. Nor was it the collecting and reprinting of his <span class="t8">Essays</span>, although they have given hundreds of thousands of minds a taste for letters and a desire for knowledge. One could hardly call it the delivery of those vehement and effective parliamentary speeches with which he held his audience spellbound, even if one of them did secure the passing of the Copyright Bill in 1842 in practically its present form. But while attending to these other matters, Macaulay had on his mind an undertaking which was destined to satisfy, as far as he carried it toward completion, the hopes of his most enthusiastic admirers. In 1841 he had written to Napier, &ldquo;I shall not be satisfied unless I produce something which shall for a few days supersede the last fashionable novel on the tables of young ladies.&rdquo; In order that he might give all his attention to this one project he soon stopped writing for the <span class="t8">Edinburgh Review</span>; he denied himself no little of the pleasure he had been getting from society; he gave up more parliamentary honors than most others could ever hope to win. At last, in 1848, he published the first volumes of a work that met with a heartier welcome than the English-speaking world had given to any historical work since the coming of Gibbon&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire</span>. That these volumes of <span class="t8">The History of England</span> were the result of a very different kind of effort from that with which Macaulay had dashed off the essays, may be inferred from a sentence of Thackeray&rsquo;s, which Trevelyan says is no exaggeration: &ldquo;He reads twenty books to write a sentence; he travels a hundred miles to make a line of description.&rdquo; After all critics may say for or against the <span class="t8">History</span>, it remains to note that Macaulay did what he undertook: he wrote a history that is more readable than most novels.</p>
<p class="p24">In other ways we can trace his &ldquo;effect on society.&rdquo; He was chosen Lord Rector of the University of Glasgow in 1848. Prince Albert tried, but in vain, to induce him to become Professor of Modern History at Cambridge in 1849. He was asked, but declined &mdash; urging the plea that he was not a debater &mdash; to join the Cabinet in 1852. The same year the people of Edinburgh, ashamed of their failure to reëlect him five years before, chose him to represent them in Parliament. Meantime he had been well and happy. In his journal for October 25, 1850, he wrote: &ldquo;My birthday. I am fifty. Well, I have had a happy life. I do not know that anybody, whom I have seen close, has had a happier. Some things I regret; but, on the whole, who is better off? I have not children of my own, it is true; but I have children whom I love as if they were my own, and who, I believe, love me. I wish that the next ten years may be as happy as the last ten. But I rather wish it than hope it.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Macaulay may have surmised that the good health which had been such an important factor in keeping him happy would not last much longer. At any rate his last election to the House of Commons was followed by an illness from which he never fully recovered, but through which, for seven years, &ldquo;he maintained his industry, his courage, his patience, and his benevolence.&rdquo; Occasionally he treated the House to a &ldquo;torrent of words,&rdquo; but he understood that he must husband his powers for work on books. To protect himself from a bookseller who advertised an edition of his speeches, he made and published a selection of his own, many of which he had to write from memory. Then he continued his work on the <span class="t8">History</span>. Some of the time he had to &ldquo;be resolute and work doggedly,&rdquo; as Johnson said. &ldquo;He almost gave up letter-writing; he quite gave up society; and at last he had not leisure even for his diary.&rdquo; Yet of this immense labor he said, &ldquo;It is the business and the pleasure of my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">As a result of this steady toil the writer secured an enviable influence abroad. He was made a member of several foreign academies, and translations have turned the <span class="t8">History</span> into a dozen tongues. At home, among the numerous honors, he was presented with the degree of Doctor of Civil Law at Oxford, and made a peer &mdash; Baron of Rothley. Naturally before receiving this last honor he had withdrawn from Parliament, and from 1856 to the end of his life he enjoyed a retired home, with a fine garden. He had plenty of time to cash the famous check for twenty thousand pounds which the first edition of the <span class="t8">History</span> brought him, and to invest and spend it as he pleased. On his fifty-seventh birthday he wrote in his diary, &ldquo;What is much more important to my happiness than wealth, titles, and even fame, those whom I love are well and happy, and very kind and affectionate to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">One of the chief sources of his happiness, one to which he was particularly indebted these last days, was his love of reading. He could no longer read fourteen books of the <span class="t8">Odyssey</span> at a stretch while out for a walk, but in the quiet of his library he enjoyed the companionship of the author he happened to be reading as perhaps few men could. He who could command any society in London failed to find any that he preferred, at breakfast or at dinner, to the company of Boswell; and it seems natural and fitting that he should be found on that last December day, in 1859, &ldquo;in the library, seated in his easy-chair, and dressed as usual, with his book on the table beside him.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Equally fitting is it that in Poet&rsquo;s Corner, Westminster Abbey, the resting place of Johnson, Garrick, Goldsmith, and Addison, there should lie a stone with this inscription:</p>
<p class="p24">THOMAS BABINGTON, LORD MACAULAY,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; BORN AT ROTHLEY TEMPLE, LEICESTERSHIRE,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OCTOBER 25TH, 1800.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DIED AT HOLLY LODGE, CAMPDEN HILL.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DECEMBER 28TH, 1859.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;His body is buried in peace,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but his name liveth for evermore.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">For he left behind him a great and honorable name, and every action of his life was &ldquo;as clear and transparent as one of his own sentences.&rdquo; His biography reveals the dutiful son, the affectionate brother, the true friend, the honorable politician, the practical legislator, the eloquent speaker, the brilliant author. It shows unmistakably that greater than all his works was the man.</p>
