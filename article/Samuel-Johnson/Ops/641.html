<p class="p21">Has two powers, expressed in modern English by two characters, <span class="t8">V</span> consonant and <span class="t8">U</span> vowel, which ought to be considered as two letters; but as they were long confounded while the two uses were annexed to one form, the old custom still continues to be followed.</p>
<p class="p32"><span class="t8">U</span>, the vowel, has two sounds; one clear, expressed at other times by <span class="t8">eu</span>, as <span class="t8">obtuse</span>; the other close, and approaching to the Italian <span class="t8">u</span>, or English <span class="t8">oo</span>, as <span class="t8">obtund.</span></p>
<p class="p32"><span class="t8">V</span>, the consonant, has a sound nearly approaching to those of <span class="t8">b</span> and <span class="t8">f</span>. With <span class="t8">b</span> it is by the Spaniards and Gascons always confounded, and in the Runick alphabet is expressed by the same character with <span class="t8">f</span>, distinguished only by a diacritical point. Its sound in English is uniform. It is never mute.</p>
