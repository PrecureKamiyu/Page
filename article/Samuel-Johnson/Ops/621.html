It differs from the baroscope, which only shews that the air is heavier at one time than another, without specifying the difference. The <span class="t8">barometer</span> is founded upon the Torricellian experiment, so called from Torricelli the inventor of it, at Florence, in 1643; which is a glass tube filled with mercury, horizontally sealed at one end; the other open and immerged in a bason of stagnant mercury; so that, as the weight of the atmosphere diminishes, the mercury in the tube will descend, and, as it encreases, the mercury will ascend; the column of mercury suspended in the tube, being always equal to the weight of the incumbent atmosphere. Many attempts have been made to render the changes in the <span class="t8">barometer</span> more sensible, in order to measure the atmosphere more accurately; and hence arose a great number of <span class="t8">barometers</span>, of different structures. Dr. Halley observes, in the <span class="t8">Philosophical Transactions</span>, that in calm weather, when the air is inclined to rain, the mercury is commonly low; in serene good settled weather, high. On great winds, though unaccompanied with rain, the mercury is lowest of all, with regard to the point of the compass the wind blows on. The greatest heights of the mercury are on easterly and north-easterly winds, <span class="t8">cæteris paribus</span>. After great storms of wind, when the mercury has been low, it rises again very fast. In calm frosty weather, it stands high. The more northerly places find greater alterations than the more southern; and within the tropicks, and near them, there is little or no variation of the height of the mercury. The rising of the mercury forebodes fair weather after foul, and an easterly or north-easterly wind; its falling portends southerly or westerly winds, or both. In a storm, the mercury beginning to rise, is a pretty sure sign that it begins to abate. But there are frequently great changes in the air, without any perceptible alteration in the <span class="t8">barometer</span>. The alterations of the weight of the air, are generally allowed to be the cause of those in the <span class="t8">barometer</span>; but philosophers cannot easily determine whence those alterations rise in the atmosphere.</p>
<p class="p32">The measuring the heights of mountains, and finding the elevation of places above the level of the sea, hath been much promoted by barometrical experiments, founded upon that essential property of the air, its gravity or pressure. As the column of mercury in the <span class="t8">barometer</span> is counterpoised by a column of air of equal weight, so whatever causes make the air heavier or lighter, the pressure of it will be thereby encreased or lessened, and of consequence the mercury will rise or fall. Again, the air is condensed or expanded, in proportion to the weight or force that presses it. Hence it is, that the higher from the sea, in the midland countries, the mercury descends the lower; because the air becomes more rarified and lighter, and it falls lowest upon the tops of the highest mountains. <span class="t8">Harris.</span></p>
<p class="p32">Gravity is another property of air, whereby it counterpoises a column of mercury from twenty-seven inches and one half to thirty and one half, the gravity of the atmosphere varying one tenth, which are its utmost limits; so that the exact specifick gravity of the air cannot be determined when the <span class="t8">barometer</span> stands at thirty inches, with a moderate heat of the weather. <span class="t8">Arbuthnot on Air.</span></p>
<p class="p32"><span class="t25">Báron</span>. <span class="t8">n.s.</span> [The etymology of this word is very uncertain. <span class="t8">Baro</span>, among the Romans, signified a brave warriour, or a brutal man; and, from the first of these significations, <span class="t8">Menage</span> derives <span class="t8">baron</span>, as a term of military dignity. Others suppose it originally to signify only a man; in which sense <span class="t8">baron</span>, or <span class="t8">varon</span>, is still used by the Spaniards; and, to confirm this conjecture, our law yet uses <span class="t8">baron</span> and <span class="t8">femme</span>, husband and wife. Others deduce it from <span class="t8">ber</span>, an old Gaulish word, signifying commander; others from the Hebrew נבר, of the same import. Some think it a contraction of <span class="t8">par homme</span>, or <span class="t8">peer</span>, which seems least probable.]</p>
<p class="p32">1. A degree of nobility next to a viscount. It may be probably thought, that anciently, in England, all those were called <span class="t8">barons</span>, that had such signiories as we now call <span class="t8">court barons</span>. And it is said, that, after the conquest, all such came to the parliament, and sat as nobles in the upper house. But when, by experience, it appeared, that the parliament was too much crouded with such multitudes, it became a custom, that none should come, but such as the king, for their extraordinary wisdom or quality, thought good to call by writ; which writ ran <span class="t8">hac vice tantum</span>. After that, men, seeing that this state of nobility was but casual, and depending merely on the prince&rsquo;s pleasure, obtained of the king letters patent of this dignity to them and their heirs male: and these were called <span class="t8">barons</span> by letters patent, or by creation; whose posterity are now those <span class="t8">barons</span> that are called lords of the parliament; of which kind the king may create more at his pleasure. It is nevertheless thought, that there are yet <span class="t8">barons</span> by writ, as well as <span class="t8">barons</span> by letters patent, and that they may be discerned by their titles; the <span class="t8">barons</span> by writ being those, that to the title of lord have their own surnames annexed; whereas the <span class="t8">barons</span> by letters patent, are named by their baronies. These <span class="t8">barons</span> which were first by writ, may now justly also be called <span class="t8">barons</span> by prescription; for that they have continued <span class="t8">barons</span>, in themselves and their ancestors, beyond the memory of man. There are also <span class="t8">barons</span> by tenure, as the bishops of the land, who, by virtue of baronies annexed to their bishopricks, have always had place in the upper house of parliament, and are called lords spiritual.</p>
<p class="p32">2. <span class="t8">Baron</span> is an officer, as <span class="t8">barons</span> of the exchequer to the king: of these the principal is called lord chief <span class="t8">baron</span>, and the three others are his assistants, between the king and his subjects, in causes of justice, belonging to the exchequer.</p>
<p class="p32">3. There are also <span class="t8">barons</span> of the cinque ports; two to each of the seven towns, Hastings, Winchelsea, Rye, Rumney, Hithe, Dover, and Sandwich, that have places in the lower house of parliament. <span class="t8">Cowel.</span></p>
