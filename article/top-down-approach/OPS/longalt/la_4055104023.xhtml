Each computer is assigned an IP address. The computers on the left are configured the same as they were in figure 4.18, in terms of their positioning and IP addresses.</p><p id="P700101195200000000000000000A8FB" data-uri="M04_KURO4140_07_SE_C04.xhtml#P700101195200000000000000000A8FB">On the right, the top computer's IP address is 223.1.2.1 and the bottom computer's IP address is 223.1.2.2. These computers are connected to a cloud, and the cloud connects to the central router. This connection is assigned its own IP address, which is 223.1.2.9. In addition, we see a laptop computer labeled "Arriving DHCP client" and a server labeled "DHCP server," and both are connected to the cloud as well.</p><p id="P700101195200000000000000000A8FC" data-uri="M04_KURO4140_07_SE_C04.xhtml#P700101195200000000000000000A8FC">The computers on the bottom are configured the same way as they were in figure 4.18.</p></div></section></body></html>
