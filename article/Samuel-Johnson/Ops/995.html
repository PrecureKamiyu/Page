<p class="p24">&lsquo;That you and dear Mrs. Careless should have care or curiosity about my health, gives me that pleasure which every man feels from finding himself not forgotten. In age we feel again that love of our native place and our early friends, which in the bustle or amusements of middle life were overborne and suspended. You and I should now naturally cling to one another: we have outlived most of those who could pretend to rival us in each other&rsquo;s kindness. In our walk through life we have dropped our companions, and are now to pick up such as chance may offer us, or to travel on alone. You, indeed, have a sister, with whom you can divide the day: I have no natural friend left; but Providence has been pleased to preserve me from neglect; I have not wanted such alleviations of life as friendship could supply. My health has been, from my twentieth year, such as has seldom afforded me a single day of ease; but it is at least not worse: and I sometimes make myself believe that it is better. My disorders are, however, still sufficiently oppressive.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I think of seeing Staffordshire again this autumn, and intend to find my way through Birmingham, where I hope to see you and dear Mrs. Careless well. I am Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your affectionate friend,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I wrote to him at different dates; regretted that I could not come to London this spring, but hoped we should meet somewhere in the summer; mentioned the state of my affairs, and suggested hopes of some preferment; informed him, that as <span class="t8">The Beauties of Johnson</span> had been published in London, some obscure scribbler had published at Edinburgh what he called <span class="t8">The deformities of Johnson</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To JAMES BOSWELL, ESQ.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The pleasure which we used to receive from each other on Good-Friday and Easter-day, we must be this year content to miss. Let us, however, pray for each other, and hope to see one another yet from time to time with mutual delight. My disorder has been a cold, which impeded the organs of respiration, and kept me many weeks in a state of great uneasiness; but by repeated phlebotomy it is now relieved; and next to the recovery of Mrs. Boswell, I flatter myself, that you will rejoice at mine.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;What we shall do in the summer it is yet too early to consider. You want to know what you shall do now; I do not think this time of bustle and confusion likely to produce any advantage to you. Every man has those to reward and gratify who have contributed to his advancement. To come hither with such expectations at the expence of borrowed money, which, I find, you know not where to borrow, can hardly be considered as prudent. I am sorry to find, what your solicitation seems to imply, that you have already gone the whole length of your credit. This is to set the quiet of your whole life at hazard. If you anticipate your inheritance, you can at last inherit nothing; all that you receive must pay for the past. You must get a place, or pine in penury, with the empty name of a great estate. Poverty, my dear friend, is so great an evil, and pregnant with so much temptation, and so much misery, that I cannot but earnestly enjoin you to avoid it. Live on what you have; live if you can on less; do not borrow either for vanity or pleasure; the vanity will end in shame, and the pleasure in regret: stay therefore at home, till you have saved money for your journey hither.</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">The Beauties of Johnson</span> are said to have got money to the collector; if the <span class="t8">Deformities</span> have the same success, I shall be still a more extensive benefactor.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Make my compliments to Mrs. Boswell, who is, I hope, reconciled to me; and to the young people whom I never have offended.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;You never told me the success of your plea against the Solicitors.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am, dear Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your most affectionate,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;London, March 28, 1782.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Notwithstanding his afflicted state of body and mind this year, the following correspondence affords a proof not only of his benevolence and conscientious readiness to relieve a good man from errour, but by his cloathing one of the sentiments in his <span class="t8">Rambler</span> in different language, not inferiour to that of the original, shews his extraordinary command of clear and forcible expression.</p>
<p class="p24">A clergyman at Bath wrote to him, that in <span class="t8">The Morning Chronicle</span>, a passage in <span class="t8">The Beauties of Johnson</span>, article DEATH, had been pointed out as supposed by some readers to recommend suicide, the words being, &lsquo;To die is the fate of man; but to die with lingering anguish is generally his folly;&rsquo; and respectfully suggesting to him, that such an erroneous notion of any sentence in the writings of an acknowledged friend of religion and virtue, should not pass uncontradicted.</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson thus answered the clergyman&rsquo;s letter: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To THE REVEREND MR. &mdash;&mdash; , AT BATH.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Being now in the country in a state of recovery, as I hope, from a very oppressive disorder, I cannot neglect the acknowledgement of your Christian letter. The book called <span class="t8">The Beauties of Johnson</span> is the production of I know not whom: I never saw it but by casual inspection, and considered myself as utterly disengaged from its consequences. Of the passage you mention, I remember some notice in some paper; but knowing that it must be misrepresented, I thought of it no more, nor do I know where to find it in my own books. I am accustomed to think little of newspapers; but an opinion so weighty and serious as yours has determined me to do, what I should, without your seasonable admonition, have omitted; and I will direct my thought to be shewn in its true state. If I could find the passage, I would direct you to it. I suppose the tenour is this:&mdash; &lsquo;Acute diseases are the immediate and inevitable strokes of Heaven; but of them the pain is short, and the conclusion speedy; chronical disorders, by which we are suspended in tedious torture between life and death, are commonly the effect of our own misconduct and intemperance. To die, &amp;c.&rsquo; &mdash; This, Sir, you see is all true and all blameless. I hope, some time in the next week, to have all rectified. My health has been lately much shaken: if you favour me with any answer, it will be a comfort to me to know that I have your prayers.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am, &amp;c.,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;May 15, 1782.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">This letter, as might be expected, had its full effect, and the clergyman acknowledged it in grateful and pious terms.</p>
<p class="p24">The following letters require no extracts from mine to introduce them: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;TO JAMES BOSWELL, ESQ.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The earnestness and tenderness of your letter is such, that I cannot think myself shewing it more respect than it claims by sitting down to answer it the day on which I received it.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;This year has afflicted me with a very irksome and severe disorder. My respiration has been much impeded, and much blood has been taken away. I am now harrassed by a catarrhous cough, from which my purpose is to seek relief by change of air; and I am, therefore, preparing to go to Oxford.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Whether I did right in dissuading you from coming to London this spring, I will not determine. You have not lost much by missing my company; I have scarcely been well for a single week. I might have received comfort from your kindness; but you would have seen me afflicted, and, perhaps, found me peevish. Whatever might have been your pleasure or mine, I know not how I could have honestly advised you to come hither with borrowed money. Do not accustom yourself to consider debt only as an inconvenience; you will find it a calamity. Poverty takes away so many means of doing good, and produces so much inability to resist evil, both natural and moral, that it is by all virtuous means to be avoided. Consider a man whose fortune is very narrow; whatever be his rank by birth, or whatever his reputation by intellectual excellence, what good can he do? or what evil can he prevent? That he cannot help the needy is evident; he has nothing to spare. But, perhaps, his advice or admonition may be useful. His poverty will destroy his influence: many more can find that he is poor, than that he is wise; and few will reverence the understanding that is of so little advantage to its owner. I say nothing of the personal wretched-ness of a debtor, which, however, has passed into a proverb. Of riches, it is not necessary to write the praise. Let it, however, be remembered, that he who has money to spare, has it always in his power to benefit others; and of such power a good man must always be desirous.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am pleased with your account of Easter. We shall meet, I hope in Autumn, both well and both cheerful; and part each the better for the other&rsquo;s company.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Make my compliments to Mrs. Boswell, and to the young charmers.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am, &amp;c.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo; &lsquo;London, June 3, 1782.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To MR. PERKINS.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">I am much pleased that you are going a very long journey, which may by proper conduct restore your health and prolong your life.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Observe these rules:</p>
<p class="p24">1. Turn all care out of your head as soon as you mount the chaise.</p>
<p class="p24">2. Do not think about frugality; your health is worth more than it can cost.</p>
<p class="p24">3. Do not continue any day&rsquo;s journey to fatigue.</p>
<p class="p24">4. Take now and then a day&rsquo;s rest.</p>
<p class="p24">5. Get a smart sea-sickness, if you can.</p>
<p class="p24">6. Cast away all anxiety, and keep your mind easy.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;This last direction is the principal; with an unquiet mind, neither exercise, nor diet, nor physick, can be of much use.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I wish you, dear Sir, a prosperous journey, and a happy recovery.</p>
<p class="p24">I am, dear Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your most affectionate, humble servant,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;July 28, 1782.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To JAMES BOSWELL, ESQ.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Being uncertain whether I should have any call this autumn into the country, I did not immediately answer your kind letter. I have no call; but if you desire to meet me at Ashbourne, I believe I can come thither; if you had rather come to London, I can stay at Streatham; take your choice.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;This year has been very heavy. From the middle of January to the middle of June I was battered by one disorder after another! I am now very much recovered, and hope still to be better. What happiness it is that Mrs. Boswell has escaped.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;My <span class="t8">Lives</span> are reprinting, and I have forgotten the authour of Gray&rsquo;s character: write immediately, and it may be perhaps yet inserted.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Of London or Ashbourne you have your free choice; at any place I shall be glad to see you. I am, dear Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Yours &amp;c.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Aug. 24, 1782.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On the 3Oth of August, I informed him that my honoured father had died that morning; a complaint under which he had long laboured having suddenly come to a crisis, while I was upon a visit at the seat of Sir Charles Preston, from whence I had hastened the day before, upon receiving a letter by express.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;TO JAMES BOSWELL, ESQ.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I have struggled through this year with so much infirmity of body, and such strong impressions of the fragility of life, that death, whenever it appears, fills me with melancholy; and I cannot hear without emotion, of the removal of any one, whom I have known, into another state.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your father&rsquo;s death had every circumstance that could enable you to bear it; it was at a mature age, and it was expected; and as his general life had been pious, his thoughts had doubtless for many years past been turned upon eternity. That you did not find him sensible must doubtless grieve you; his disposition towards you was undoubtedly that of a kind, though not of a fond father. Kindness, at least actual, is in our power, but fondness is not; and if by negligence or imprudence you had extinguished his fondness, he could not at will rekindle it. Nothing then remained between you but mutual forgiveness of each other&rsquo;s faults, and mutual desire of each other&rsquo;s happiness.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I shall long to know his final disposition of his fortune.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;You, dear Sir, have now a new station, and have therefore new cares, and new employments. Life, as Cowley seems to say, ought to resemble a well-ordered poem; of which one rule generally received is, that the exordium should be simple, and should promise little. Begin your new course of life with the least show, and the least expence possible; you may at pleasure encrease both, but you cannot easily diminish them. Do not think your estate your own, while any man can call upon you for money which you cannot pay; therefore, begin with timorous parsimony. Let it be your first care not to be in any man&rsquo;s debt.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;When the thoughts are extended to a future state, the present life seems hardly worthy of all those principles of conduct, and maxims of prudence, which one generation of men has transmitted to another; but upon a closer view, when it is perceived how much evil is produced, and how much good is impeded by embarrassment and distress, and how little room the expedients of poverty leave for the exercise of virtue, it grows manifest that the boundless importance of the next life enforces some attention to the interests of this.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Be kind to the old servants, and secure the kindness of the agents and factors; do not disgust them by asperity, or unwelcome gaiety, or apparent suspicion. From them you must learn the real state of your affairs, the characters of your tenants, and the value of your lands.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Make my compliments to Mrs. Boswell; I think her expectations from air and exercise are the best that she can form. I hope she will live long and happily.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I forget whether I told you that Rasay has been here; we dined cheerfully together. I entertained lately a young gentleman from Corrichatachin.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I received your letters only this morning. I am, dear Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Yours &amp;c.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;London, Sept. 7, 1782.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">In answer to my next letter, I received one from him, dissuading me from hastening to him as I had proposed; what is proper for publication is the following paragraph, equally just and tender: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;One expence, however, I would not have you to spare: let nothing be omitted that can preserve Mrs. Boswell, though it should be necessary to transplant her for a time into a softer climate. She is the prop and stay of your life. How much must your children suffer by losing her.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">My wife was now so much convinced of his sincere friendship for me, and regard for her, that, without any suggestion on my part, she wrote him a very polite and grateful letter: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;DR. JOHNSON TO MRS. BOSWELL.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;DEAR LADY,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I have not often received so much pleasure as from your invitation to Auchinleck. The journey thither and back is, indeed, too great for the latter part of the year; but if my health were fully recovered, I would suffer no little heat and cold, nor a wet or a rough road to keep me from you. I am, indeed, not without hope of seeing Auchinleck again; but to make it a pleasant place I must see its lady well, and brisk, and airy. For my sake, therefore, among many greater reasons, take care, dear Madam, of your health, spare no expence, and want no attendance that can procure ease, or preserve it. Be very careful to keep your mind quiet; and do not think it too much to give an account of your recovery to, Madam,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Yours, &amp;c.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;London, Sept. 7, 1782.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To JAMES BOSWELL, ESQ.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Having passed almost this whole year in a succession of disorders, I went in October to Brighthelmston, whither I came in a state of so much weakness, that I rested four times in walking between the inn and the lodging. By physick and abstinence I grew better, and am now reasonably easy, though at a great distance from health. I am afraid, however, that health begins, after seventy, and long before, to have a meaning different from that which it had at thirty. But it is culpable to murmur at the established order of the creation, as it is vain to oppose it. He that lives must grow old; and he that would rather grow old than die, has GOD to thank for the infirmities of old age.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;At your long silence I am rather angry. You do not, since now you are the head of your house, think it worth your while to try whether you or your friend can live longer without writing, nor suspect that after so many years of friendship, that when I do not write to you, I forget you. Put all such useless jealousies out of your head, and disdain to regulate your own practice by the practice of another, or by any other principle than the desire of doing right.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your oeconomy, I suppose, begins now to be settled; your expences are adjusted to your revenue, and all your people in their proper places. Resolve not to be poor: whatever you have, spend less. Poverty is a great enemy to human happiness; it certainly destroys liberty, and it makes some virtues impracticable, and others extremely difficult.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Let me know the history of your life, since your accession to your estate. How many houses, how many cows, how much land in your own hand, and what bargains you make with your tenants.</p>
<p class="p20">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Of my <span class="t8">Lives of the Poets</span>, they have printed a new edition in octavo, I hear, of three thousand. Did I give a set to Lord Hailes? If I did not, I will do it out of these. What did you make of all your copy?</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Mrs. Thrale and the three Misses are now for the winter in Argyll-street. Sir Joshua Reynolds has been out of order, but is well again; and I am, dear Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your affectionate humble servant,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;London, Dec. 7, 1782.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To DR. SAMUEL JOHNSON.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Edinburgh, Dec. 20, 1782.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I was made happy by your kind letter, which gave us the agreeable hopes of seeing you in Scotland again.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am much flattered by the concern you are pleased to take in my recovery. I am better, and hope to have it in my power to convince you by my attention of how much consequence I esteem your health to the world and to myself. I remain, Sir, with grateful respect,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your obliged and obedient servant,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;MARGARET BOSWELL.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">The death of Mr. Thrale had made a very material alteration with respect to Johnson&rsquo;s reception in that family. The manly authority of the husband no longer curbed the lively exuberance of the lady; and as her vanity had been fully gratified, by having the Colossus of Literature attached to her for many years, she gradually became less assiduous to please him. Whether her attachment to him was already divided by another object, I am unable to ascertain; but it is plain that Johnson&rsquo;s penetration was alive to her neglect or forced attention; for on the eth of October this year, we find him making a &lsquo;parting use of the library&rsquo; at Streatham, and pronouncing a prayer, which he composed on leaving Mr. Thrale&rsquo;s family: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Almighty God, Father of all mercy, help me by thy grace, that I may, with humble and sincere thankfulness, remember the comforts and conveniences which I have enjoyed at this place; and that I may resign them with holy submission, equally trusting in thy protection when thou givest, and when thou takest away. Have mercy upon me, Lord, have mercy upon me.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To thy fatherly protection, O Lord, I commend this family. Bless, guide, and defend them, that they may so pass through this world, as finally to enjoy in thy presence everlasting happiness, for Jesus Christ&rsquo;s sake. Amen.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">One cannot read this prayer, without some emotions not very favourable to the lady whose conduct occasioned it.</p>
<p class="p24">In one of his memorandum-books I find, &lsquo;Sunday, went to church at Streatham. <span class="t8">Templo valedixi cum osculo</span>.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He met Mr. Philip Metcalfe often at Sir Joshua Reynolds&rsquo;s, and other places, and was a good deal with him at Brighthelmston this autumn, being pleased at once with his excellent table and animated conversation. Mr. Metcalfe shewed him great respect, and sent him a note that he might have the use of his carriage whenever he pleased. Johnson (3d October, 1782) returned this polite answer:&mdash; &lsquo;Mr. Johnson is very much obliged by the kind offer of the carriage, but he has no desire of using Mr. Metcalfe&rsquo;s carriage, except when he can have the pleasure of Mr. Metcalfe&rsquo;s company.&rsquo; Mr. Metcalfe could not but be highly pleased that his company was thus valued by Johnson, and he frequently attended him in airings. They also went together to Chichester, and they visited Petworth, and Cowdry, the venerable seat of the Lords Montacute. &lsquo;Sir, (said Johnson,) I should like to stay here four-and-twenty hours. We see here how our ancestors lived.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">That his curiosity was still unabated, appears from two letters to Mr. John Nichols, of the 10th and 20th of October this year. In one he says, &lsquo;I have looked into your <span class="t8">Anecdotes</span>, and you will hardly thank a lover of literary history for telling you, that he has been much informed and gratified. I wish you would add your own discoveries and intelligence to those of Dr. Rawlinson, and undertake the Supplement to Wood&rsquo;. Think of it.&rsquo; In the other, &lsquo;I wish, Sir, you could obtain some fuller information of Jortin, Markland, and Thirlby. They were three contemporaries of great eminence.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;TO SIR JOSHUA REYNOLDS.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I heard yesterday of your late disorder, and should think ill of myself if I had heard of it without alarm. I heard likewise Of your recovery, which I sincerely wish to be complete and permanent. Your country has been in danger of losing one of its brightest ornaments, and I of losing one of my oldest and kindest friends: but I hope you will still live long, for the honour of the nation: and that more enjoyment of your elegance, your intelligence, and your benevolence, is still reserved for, dear Sir, your most affectionate, &amp;c.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Brighthelmston,</p>
<p class="p24">Nov. 14, 1782.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">The Reverend Mr. Wilson having dedicated to him his <span class="t8">Archaeological Dictionary</span>, that mark of respect was thus acknowledged: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;TO THE REVEREND MR. WILSON, CLITHEROE, LANCASHIRE.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;REVEREND SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;That I have long omitted to return you thanks for the honour conferred upon me by your Dedication, I entreat you with great earnestness not to consider as more faulty than it is. A very importunate and oppressive disorder has for some time debarred me from the pleasures, and obstructed me in the duties of life. The esteem and kindness of wise and good men is one of the last pleasures which I can be content to lose; and gratitude to those from whom this pleasure is received, is a duty of which I hope never to be reproached with the final neglect. I therefore now return you thanks for the notice which I have received from you, and which I consider as giving to my name not only more bulk, but more weight; not only as extending its superficies, but as increasing its value. Your book was evidently wanted, and will, I hope, find its way into the school, to which, however, I do not mean to confine it; for no man has so much skill in ancient rites and practices as not to want it. As I suppose myself to owe part of your kindness to my excellent friend, Dr. Patten, he has likewise a just claim to my acknowledgements, which I hope you, Sir, will transmit. There will soon appear a new edition of my Poetical Biography; if you will accept of a copy to keep me in your mind, be pleased to let me know how it may be conveniently conveyed to you. The present is small, but it is given with good will by, Reverend Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your most, &amp;c.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;December 31, 1782.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">1783: AETAT. 74. &mdash; In 1783, he was more severely afflicted than ever, as will appear in the course of his correspondence; but still the same ardour for literature, the same constant piety, the same kindness for his friends, and the same vivacity, both in conversation and writing, distinguished him.</p>
<p class="p24">Having given Dr. Johnson a full account of what I was doing at Auchinleck, and particularly mentioned what I knew would please him, &mdash; my having brought an old man of eighty-eight from a lonely cottage to a comfortable habitation within my enclosures, where he had good neighbours near to him, &mdash; I received an answer in February, of which I extract what follows: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am delighted with your account of your activity at Auchinleck, and wish the old gentleman, whom you have so kindly removed, may live long to promote your prosperity by his prayers. You have now a new character and new duties: think on them and practise them.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Make an impartial estimate of your revenue, and whatever it is, live upon less. Resolve never to be poor. Frugality is not only the basis of quiet, but of beneficence. No man can help others that wants help himself; we must have enough before we have to spare.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am glad to find that Mrs. Boswell grows well; and hope that to keep her well, no care nor caution will be omitted. May you long live happily together.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;When you come hither, pray bring with you Baxter&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Anacreon</span>. I cannot get that edition in London.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Friday, March 31, having arrived in London the night before, I was glad to find him at Mrs. Thrale&rsquo;s house, in Argyll-street, appearances of friendship between them being still kept up. I was shewn into his room, and after the first salutation he said, &lsquo;I am glad you are come. I am very ill.&rsquo; He looked pale, and was distressed with a difficulty of breathing; but after the common inquiries he assumed his usual strong animated style of conversation. Seeing me now for the first time as a <span class="t8">Laird</span>, or proprietor of land, he began thus: &lsquo;Sir, the superiority of a country-gentleman over the people upon his estate is very agreeable; and he who says he does not feel it to be agreeable, lies; for it must be agreeable to have a casual superiority over those who are by nature equal with us.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Yet, Sir, we see great proprietors of land who prefer living in London.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, the pleasure of living in London, the intellectual superiority that is enjoyed there, may counter-balance the other. Besides, Sir, a man may prefer the state of the country-gentleman upon the whole, and yet there may never be a moment when he is willing to make the change to quit London for it.&rsquo; He said, &lsquo;It is better to have five <span class="t8">per cent</span>. out of land than out of money, because it is more secure; but the readiness of transfer, and promptness of interest, make many people rather choose the funds. Nay, there is another disadvantage belonging to land, compared with money. A man is not so much afraid of being a hard creditor, as of being a hard landlord.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Because there is a sort of kindly connection between a landlord and his tenants.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;No, Sir; many landlords with us never see their tenants. It is because if a landlord drives away his tenants, he may not get others; whereas the demand for money is so great, it may always be lent.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He talked with regret and indignation of the factious opposition to Government at this time, and imputed it in a great measure to the Revolution. &lsquo;Sir, (said he, in a low voice, having come nearer to me, while his old prejudices seemed to be fermenting in his mind,) this Hanoverian family is <span class="t8">isolée</span> here. They have no friends. Now the Stuarts had friends who stuck by them so late as 1745. When the right of the King is not reverenced, there will not be reverence for those appointed by the King.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">His observation that the present royal family has no friends, has been too much justified by the very ungrateful behaviour of many who were under great obligations to his Majesty; at the same time there are honourable exceptions; and the very next year after this conversation, and ever since, the King has had as extensive and generous support as ever was given to any monarch, and has had the satisfaction of knowing that he was more and more endeared to his people.</p>
<p class="p24">He repeated to me his verses on Mr. Levett, with an emotion which gave them full effect; and then he was pleased to say, &lsquo;You must be as much with me as you can. You have done me good. You cannot think how much better I am since you came in.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He sent a message to acquaint Mrs. Thrale that I was arrived. I had not seen her since her husband&rsquo;s death. She soon appeared, and favoured me with an invitation to stay to dinner, which I accepted. There was no other company but herself and three of her daughters, Dr. Johnson, and I. She too said, she was very glad I was come, for she was going to Bath, and should have been sorry to leave Dr. Johnson before I came. This seemed to be attentive and kind; and I who had not been informed of any change, imagined all to be as well as formerly. He was little inclined to talk at dinner, and went to sleep after it; but when he joined us in the drawing-room, he seemed revived, and was again himself.</p>
<p class="p24">Talking of conversation, he said, &lsquo;There must, in the first place, be knowledge, there must be materials; in the second place, there must be a command of words; in the third place, there must be imagination, to place things in such views as they are not commonly seen in; and in the fourth place, there must be presence of mind, and a resolution that is not to be overcome by failures: this last is an essential requisite; for want of it many people do not excel in conversation. Now <span class="t8">I</span> want it: I throw up the game upon losing a trick.&rsquo; I wondered to hear him talk thus of himself, and said, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know, Sir, how this may be; but I am sure you beat other people&rsquo;s cards out of their hands.&rsquo; I doubt whether he heard this remark. While he went on talking triumphantly, I was fixed in admiration, and said to Mrs. Thrale, &lsquo;O, for short-hand to take this down!&rsquo; &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll carry it all in your head; (said she;) a long head is as good as short-hand.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">It has been observed and wondered at, that Mr. Charles Fox never talked with any freedom in the presence of Dr. Johnson, though it is well known, and I myself can witness, that his conversation is various, fluent, and exceedingly agreeable. Johnson&rsquo;s own experience, however, of that gentleman&rsquo;s reserve was a sufficient reason for his going on thus: &lsquo;Fox never talks in private company; not from any determination not to talk, but because he has not the first motion. A man who is used to the applause of the House of Commons, has no wish for that of a private company. A man accustomed to throw for a thousand pounds, if set down to throw for sixpence, would not be at the pains to count his dice. Burke&rsquo;s talk is the ebullition of his mind; he does not talk from a desire of distinction, but because his mind is full.</p>
<p class="p24">He thus curiously characterised one of our old acquaintance: &lsquo; &mdash;&mdash; is a good man, Sir; but he is a vain man and a liar. He, however, only tells lies of vanity; of victories, for instance, in conversation, which never happened.&rsquo; This alluded to a story which I had repeated from that gentleman, to entertain Johnson with its wild bravado: &lsquo;This Johnson, Sir, (said he,) whom you are all afraid of will shrink, if you come close to him in argument and roar as loud as he. He once maintained the paradox, that there is no beauty but in utility. &ldquo;Sir, (said I,) what say you to the peacock&rsquo;s tail, which is one of the most beautiful objects in nature, but would have as much utility if its feathers were all of one colour.&rdquo; He <span class="t8">felt</span> what I thus produced, and had recourse to his usual expedient, ridicule; exclaiming, &ldquo;A peacock has a tail, and a fox has a tail;&rdquo; and then he burst out into a laugh. &ldquo;Well, Sir, (said I, with a strong voice, looking him full in the face,) you have unkennelled your fox; pursue him if you dare.&rdquo; He had not a word to say, Sir.&rsquo; Johnson told me, that this was a fiction from beginning to end.</p>
<p class="p24">After musing for some time, he said, &lsquo;I wonder how I should have any enemies; for I do harm to nobody.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;In the first place, Sir, you will be pleased to recollect, that you set out with attacking the Scotch; so you got a whole nation for your enemies.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, I own, that by my definition of <span class="t8">oats</span> I meant to vex them.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Pray, Sir, can you trace the cause of your antipathy to the Scotch.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;I cannot, Sir.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Old Mr. Sheridan says, it was because they sold Charles the First.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Then, Sir, old Mr. Sheridan has found out a very good reason.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Surely the most obstinate and sulky nationality, the most determined aversion to this great and good man, must be cured, when he is seen thus playing with one of his prejudices, of which he candidly admitted that he could not tell the reason. It was, however, probably owing to his having had in his view the worst part of the Scottish nation, the needy adventurers, many of whom he thought were advanced above their merits by means which he did not approve. Had he in his early life been in Scotland, and seen the worthy, sensible, independent gentlemen, who live rationally and hospitably at home, he never could have entertained such unfavourable and unjust notions of his fellow-subjects. And accordingly we find, that when he did visit Scotland, in the latter period of his life, he was fully sensible of all that it deserved, as I have already pointed out, when speaking of his <span class="t8">Journey to the Western Islands</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">Next day, Saturday, March 22, I found him still at Mrs. Thrale&rsquo;s, but he told me that he was to go to his own house in the afternoon. He was better, but I perceived he was but an unruly patient, for Sir Lucas Pepys, who visited him, while I was with him said, &lsquo;If you were <span class="t8">tractable</span>, Sir, I should prescribe for you.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I related to him a remark which a respectable friend had made to me, upon the then state of Government, when those who had been long in opposition had attained to power, as it was supposed, against the inclination of the Sovereign. &lsquo;You need not be uneasy (said this gentleman) about the King. He laughs at them all; he plays them one against another.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t think so, Sir. The King is as much oppressed as a man can be. If he plays them one against another, he <span class="t8">wins</span> nothing.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I had paid a visit to General Oglethorpe in the morning, and was told by him that Dr. Johnson saw company on Saturday evenings, and he would meet me at Johnson&rsquo;s that night. When I mentioned this to Johnson, not doubting that it would please him, as he had a great value for Oglethorpe, the fretfulness of his disease unexpectedly shewed itself; his anger suddenly kindled, and he said, with vehemence, &lsquo;Did not you tell him not to come? Am I to be <span class="t8">hunted</span> in this manner?&rsquo; I satisfied him that I could not divine that the visit would not be convenient, and that I certainly could not take it upon me of my own accord to forbid the General.</p>
<p class="p24">I found Dr. Johnson in the evening in Mrs. Williams&rsquo;s room, at tea and coffee with her and Mrs. Desmoulins, who were also both ill; it was a sad scene, and he was not in very good humour. He said of a performance that had lately come out, &lsquo;Sir, if you should search all the madhouses in England, you would not find ten men who would write so, and think it sense.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I was glad when General Oglethorpe&rsquo;s arrival was announced, and we left the ladies. Dr. Johnson attended him in the parlour, and was as courteous as ever. The General said he was busy reading the writers of the middle age. Johnson said they were very curious. OGLETHORPE. &lsquo;The House of Commons has usurped the power of the nation&rsquo;s money, and used it tyrannically. Government is now carried on by corrupt influence, instead of the inherent right in the King.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, the want of inherent right in the King occasions all this disturbance. What we did at the Revolution was necessary: but it broke our constitution.&rsquo; OGLETHORPE. &lsquo;My father did not think it necessary.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Sunday, March 23, I breakfasted with Dr. Johnson, who seemed much relieved, having taken opium the night before. He however protested against it, as a remedy that should be given with the utmost reluctance, and only in extreme necessity. I mentioned how commonly it was used in Turkey, and that therefore it could not be so pernicious as he apprehended. He grew warm and said, &lsquo;Turks take opium, and Christians take opium; but Russel, in his <span class="t8">Account of Aleppo</span>, tells us, that it is as disgraceful in Turkey to take too much opium, as it is with us to get drunk. Sir, it is amazing how things are exaggerated. A gentleman was lately telling in a company where I was present, that in France as soon as a man of fashion marries, he takes an opera girl into keeping; and this he mentioned as a general custom. &lsquo;Pray, Sir, (said I,) how many opera girls may there be?&rsquo; He answered, &lsquo;About fourscore.&rsquo; Well then, Sir, (said I,) you see there can be no more than fourscore men of fashion who can do this.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Mrs. Desmoulins made tea; and she and I talked before him upon a topick which he had once borne patiently from me when we were by ourselves, &mdash; his not complaining of the world, because he was not called to some great office, nor had attained to great wealth. He flew into a violent passion, I confess with some justice, and commanded us to have done. &lsquo;Nobody, (said he) has a right to talk in this manner, to bring before a man his own character, and the events of his life, when he does not choose it should be done. I never have sought the world; the world was not to seek me. It is rather wonderful that so much has been done for me. All the complaints which are made of the world are unjust. I never knew a man of merit neglected: it was generally by his own fault that he failed of success. A man may hide his head in a hole: he may go into the country, and publish a book now and then, which nobody reads, and then complain he is neglected. There is no reason why any person should exert himself for a man who has written a good book: he has not written it for any individual. I may as well make a present to the postman who brings me a letter. When patronage was limited, an authour expected to find a Maecenas, and complained if he did not find one. Why should he complain? This Maecenas has others as good as he, or others who have got the start of him.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;But surely, Sir, you will allow that there are men of merit at the bar, who never get practice.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, you are sure that practice is got from an opinion that the person employed deserves it best; so that if a man of merit at the bar does not get practice, it is from errour, not from injustice. He is not neglected. A horse that is brought to market may not be bought, though he is a very good horse: but that is from ignorance, not from intention.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">There was in this discourse much novelty, ingenuity, and discrimination, such as is seldom to be found. Yet I cannot help thinking that men of merit, who have no success in life, may be forgiven for <span class="t8">lamenting</span>, if they are not allowed to <span class="t8">complain</span>. They may consider it as <span class="t8">hard</span> that their merit should not have its suitable distinction. Though there is no intentional injustice towards them on the part of the world, their merit not having been perceived, they may yet repine against <span class="t8">fortune</span>, or <span class="t8">fate</span>, or by whatever name they choose to call the supposed mythological power of <span class="t8">Destiny</span>. It has, however, occurred to me, as a consolatory thought, that men of merit should consider thus:-How much harder would it be if the same persons had both all the merit and all the prosperity. Would not this be a miserable distribution for the poor dunces? Would men of merit exchange their intellectual superiority, and the enjoyments arising from it, for external distinction and the pleasures of wealth? If they would not, let them not envy others, who are poor where they are rich, a compensation which is made to them. Let them look inwards and be satisfied; recollecting with conscious pride what Virgil finely says of the <span class="t8">Corycius Senex</span>, and which I have, in another place, with truth and sincerity applied to Mr. Burke: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;<span class="t8">Regum aequabat opes animis536.&rsquo;</span></p>
<p class="p24">On the subject of the right employment of wealth, Johnson observed, &lsquo;A man cannot make a bad use of his money, so far as regards Society, if he does not hoard it; for if he either spends it or lends it out, Society has the benefit. It is in general better to spend money than to give it away; for industry is more promoted by spending money than by giving it away. A man who spends his money is sure he is doing good with it: he is not so sure when he gives it away. A man who spends ten thousand a year will do more good than a man who spends two thousand and gives away eight.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">In the evening I came to him again. He was somewhat fretful from his illness. A gentleman asked him, whether he had been abroad to-day. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t talk so childishly, (said he.) You may as well ask if I hanged myself to-day.&rsquo; I mentioned politicks. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, I&rsquo;d as soon have a man to break my bones as talk to me of publick affairs, internal or external. I have lived to see things all as bad as they can be.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Having mentioned his friend the second Lord Southwell, he said, &lsquo;Lord Southwell was the highest-bred man without insolence that I ever was in company with; the most <span class="t8">qualified</span> I ever saw. Lord Orrery was not dignified: Lord Chesterfield was, but he was insolent. Lord &mdash;&mdash; is a man of coarse manners, but a man of abilities and information. I don&rsquo;t say he is a man I would set at the head of a nation, though perhaps he may be as good as the next Prime Minister that comes; but he is a man to be at the head of a Club; I don&rsquo;t say <span class="t8">our</span> CLUB; for there&rsquo;s no such Club.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;But, Sir, was he not once a factious man?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;O yes, Sir; as factious a fellow as could be found: one who was for sinking us all into the mob.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;How then, Sir, did he get into favour with the King?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Because, Sir, I suppose he promised the King to do whatever the King pleased.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He said, &lsquo;Goldsmith&rsquo;s blundering speech to Lord Shelburne, which has been so often mentioned, and which he really did make to him, was only a blunder in emphasis: &ldquo;I wonder they should call your Lordship <span class="t8">Malagrida</span>, for Malagrida was a very good man;&rdquo; meant, I wonder they should use <span class="t8">Malagrida</span> as a term of reproach.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Soon after this time I had an opportunity of seeing, by means of one of his friends, a proof that his talents, as well as his obliging service to authours, were ready as ever. He had revised <span class="t8">The Village</span>, an admirable poem, by the Reverend Mr. Crabbe. Its sentiments as to the false notions of rustick happiness and rustick virtue were quite congenial with his own; and he had taken the trouble not only to suggest slight corrections and variations, but to furnish some lines, when he thought he could give the writer&rsquo;s meaning better than in the words of the manuscript.</p>
<p class="p24">On Sunday, March 30, I found him at home in the evening, and had the pleasure to meet with Dr. Brocklesby, whose reading, and knowledge of life, and good spirits, supply him with a never-failing source of conversation. He mentioned a respectable gentleman, who became extremely penurious near the close of his life. Johnson said there must have been a degree of madness about him. &lsquo;Not at all, Sir, (said Dr. Brocklesby,) his judgement was entire.&rsquo; Unluckily, however, he mentioned that although he had a fortune of twenty-seven thousand pounds, he denied himself many comforts, from an apprehension that he could not afford them. &lsquo;Nay, Sir, (cried Johnson,) when the judgement is so disturbed that a man cannot count, that is pretty well.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I shall here insert a few of Johnson&rsquo;s sayings, without the formality of dates, as they have no reference to any particular time or place.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The more a man extends and varies his acquaintance the better.&rsquo; This, however, was meant with a just restriction; for, he on another occasion said to me, &lsquo;Sir, a man may be so much of every thing, that he is nothing of any thing.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Raising the wages of day-labourers is wrong; for it does not make them live better, but only makes them idler, and idleness is a very bad thing for human nature.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;It is a very good custom to keep a journal for a man&rsquo;s own use; he may write upon a card a day all that is necessary to be written, after he has had experience of life. At first there is a great deal to be written, because there is a great deal of novelty; but when once a man has settled his opinions, there is seldom much to be set down.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;There is nothing wonderful in the journal which we see Swift kept in London, for it contains slight topicks, and it might soon be written.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I praised the accuracy of an account-book of a lady whom I mentioned. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Keeping accounts, Sir, is of no use when a man is spending his own money, and has nobody to whom he is to account. You won&rsquo;t eat less beef to-day, because you have written down what it cost yesterday.&rsquo; I mentioned another lady who thought as he did, so that her husband could not get her to keep an account of the expence of the family, as she thought it enough that she never exceeded the sum allowed her. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, it is fit she should keep an account, because her husband wishes it; but I do not see its use.&rsquo; I maintained that keeping an account has this advantage, that it satisfies a man that his money has not been lost or stolen, which he might sometimes be apt to imagine, were there no written state of his expence; and beside, a calculation of oeconomy so as not to exceed one&rsquo;s income, cannot be made without a view of the different articles in figures, that one may see how to retrench in some particulars less necessary than others. This he did not attempt to answer.</p>
<p class="p24">Talking of an acquaintance of ours, whose narratives, which abounded in curious and interesting topicks, were unhappily found to be very fabulous; I mentioned Lord Mansfield&rsquo;s having said to me, &lsquo;Suppose we believe one <span class="t8">half</span> of what he tells.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Ay; but we don&rsquo;t know <span class="t8">which</span> half to believe. By his lying we lose not only our reverence for him, but all comfort in his conversation.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;May we not take it as amusing fiction?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, the misfortune is, that you will insensibly believe as much of it as you incline to believe.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">It is remarkable, that notwithstanding their congeniality in politicks, he never was acquainted with a late eminent noble judge, whom I have heard speak of him as a writer, with great respect. Johnson, I know not upon what degree of investigation, entertained no exalted opinion of his Lordship&rsquo;s intellectual character. Talking of him to me one day, he said, &lsquo;It is wonderful, Sir, with how little real superiority of mind men can make an eminent figure in publick life.&rsquo; He expressed himself to the same purpose concerning another law-Lord, who, it seems, once took a fancy to associate with the wits of London; but with so little success, that Foote said, &lsquo;What can he mean by coming among us? He is not only dull himself, but the cause of dullness in others.&rsquo; Trying him by the test of his colloquial powers, Johnson had found him very defective. He once said to Sir Joshua Reynolds, &lsquo;This man now has been ten years about town, and has made nothing of it;&rsquo; meaning as a companion. He said to me, &lsquo;I never heard any thing from him in company that was at all striking; and depend upon it, Sir, it is when you come close to a man in conversation, that you discover what his real abilities are; to make a speech in a publick assembly is a knack. Now I honour Thurlow, Sir; Thurlow is a fine fellow; he fairly puts his mind to yours.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">After repeating to him some of his pointed, lively sayings, I said, &lsquo;It is a pity, Sir, you don&rsquo;t always remember your own good things, that you may have a laugh when you will.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Nay, Sir, it is better that I forget them, that I may be reminded of them, and have a laugh on their being brought to my recollection.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">When I recalled to him his having said as we sailed up Loch-lomond, &lsquo;That if he wore any thing fine, it should be <span class="t8">very</span> fine;&rsquo; I observed that all his thoughts were upon a great scale. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Depend upon it, Sir, every man will have as fine a thing as he can get; as a large diamond for his ring.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Pardon me, Sir: a man of a narrow mind will not think of it, a slight trinket will satisfy him:</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;<span class="t8">Nee sufferre queat majoris pondera gemmae</span>561.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I told him I should send him some Essays which I had written, which I hoped he would be so good as to read, and pick out the good ones. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Nay, Sir, send me only the good ones; don&rsquo;t make <span class="t8">me</span> pick them.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I heard him once say, &lsquo;Though the proverb <span class="t8">Nullum numen abest, si sit prudentia, does not always prove true, we may be certain of the converse of it,</span> Nullum numen adest, si sit imprudentia<span class="t8">.&rsquo;</span></p>
<p class="p24">Once, when Mr. Seward was going to Bath, and asked his commands, he said, &lsquo;Tell Dr. Harrington that I wish he would publish another volume of the Nugae antiquae<span class="t8">; it is a very pretty book.&rsquo; Mr. Seward seconded this wish, and recommended to Dr. Harrington to dedicate it to Johnson, and take for his motto, what Catullus says to Cornelius Nepos: &mdash; </span></p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo; &mdash;&mdash; namque tu solebas,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meas esse aliquid putare<span class="t8"> NUGAS566.&rsquo;</span></p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p24">As a small proof of his kindliness and delicacy of feeling, the following circumstance may be mentioned: One evening when we were in the street together, and I told him I was going to sup at Mr. Beauclerk&rsquo;s, he said, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll go with you.&rsquo; After having walked part of the way, seeming to recollect something, he suddenly stopped and said, &lsquo;I cannot go, &mdash; but I do not love Beauclerk the less<span class="t8">.&rsquo;</span></p>
<p class="p24">On the frame of his portrait, Mr. Beauclerk had inscribed, &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo; &mdash;&mdash; Ingenium ingens</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inculto latet hoc sub corpore<span class="t8">567.&rsquo;</span></p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p24">After Mr. Beauclerk&rsquo;s death, when it became Mr. Langton&rsquo;s property, he made the inscription be defaced. Johnson said complacently, &lsquo;It was kind in you to take it off;&rsquo; and then after a short pause, added, &lsquo;and not unkind in him to put it on.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He said, &lsquo;How few of his friends&rsquo; houses would a man choose to be at when he is sick.&rsquo; He mentioned one or two. I recollect only Thrale&rsquo;s.</p>
<p class="p24">He observed, &lsquo;There is a wicked inclination in most people to suppose an old man decayed in his intellects. If a young or middle-aged man, when leaving a company, does not recollect where he laid his hat, it is nothing; but if the same inattention is discovered in an old man, people will shrug up their shoulders, and say, &lsquo;His memory is going.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">When I once talked to him of some of the sayings which every body repeats, but nobody knows where to find, such as Quos DEUS vult perdere, prius dementat<span class="t8">; he told me that he was once offered ten guineas to point out from whence</span> Semel insanivimus omnes <span class="t8">was taken. He could not do it; but many years afterwards met with it by chance in</span> Johannes Baptista Mantuanus<span class="t8">.</span></p>
<p class="p24">I am very sorry that I did not take a note of an eloquent argument in which he maintained that the situation of Prince of Wales was the happiest of any person&rsquo;s in the kingdom, even beyond that of the Sovereign. I recollect only &mdash; the enjoyment of hope, &mdash; the high superiority of rank, without the anxious cares of government, &mdash; and a great degree of power, both from natural influence wisely used, and from the sanguine expectations of those who look forward to the chance of future favour.</p>
<p class="p24">Sir Joshua Reynolds communicated to me the following particulars: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">Johnson thought the poems published as translations from Ossian had so little merit, that he said, &lsquo;Sir, a man might write such stuff for ever, if he would abandon <span class="t8">his mind to it.&rsquo;</span></p>
<p class="p24">He said, &lsquo;A man should pass a part of his time with the laughers<span class="t8">, by which means any thing ridiculous or particular about him might be presented to his view, and corrected.&rsquo; I observed, he must have been a bold laugher who would have ventured to tell Dr. Johnson of any of his particularities.</span></p>
<p class="p24">Having observed the vain ostentatious importance of many people in quoting the authority of Dukes and Lords, as having been in their company, he said, he went to the other extreme, and did not mention his authority when he should have done it, had it not been that of a Duke or a Lord.</p>
<p class="p24">Dr. Goldsmith said once to Dr. Johnson, that he wished for some additional members to the LITERARY CLUB, to give it an agreeable variety; for (said he,) there can now be nothing new among us: we have travelled over one another&rsquo;s minds. Johnson seemed a little angry, and said, &lsquo;Sir, you have not travelled over my <span class="t8">mind, I promise you.&rsquo; Sir Joshua, however, thought Goldsmith right; observing, that &lsquo;when people have lived a great deal together, they know what each of them will say on every subject. A new understanding, therefore, is desirable; because though it may only furnish the same sense upon a question which would have been furnished by those with whom we are accustomed to live, yet this sense will have a different colouring; and colouring is of much effect in every thing else as well as in painting.&rsquo;</span></p>
<p class="p24">Johnson used to say that he made it a constant rule to talk as well as he could both as to sentiment and expression, by which means, what had been originally effort became familiar and easy. The consequence of this, Sir Joshua observed, was, that his common conversation in all companies was such as to secure him universal attention, as something above the usual colloquial style was expected.</p>
<p class="p24">Yet, though Johnson had this habit in company, when another mode was necessary, in order to investigate truth, he could descend to a language intelligible to the meanest capacity. An instance of this was witnessed by Sir Joshua Reynolds, when they were present at an examination of a little blackguard boy, by Mr. Saunders Welch, the late Westminster Justice. Welch, who imagined that he was exalting himself in Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s eyes by using big words, spoke in a manner that was utterly unintelligible to the boy; Dr. Johnson perceiving it, addressed himself to the boy, and changed the pompous phraseology into colloquial language. Sir Joshua Reynolds, who was much amused by this procedure, which seemed a kind of reversing of what might have been expected from the two men, took notice of it to Dr. Johnson, as they walked away by themselves. Johnson said, that it was continually the case; and that he was always obliged to translate <span class="t8">the Justice&rsquo;s swelling diction, (smiling,) so as that his meaning might be understood by the vulgar, from whom information was to be obtained.</span></p>
<p class="p24">Sir Joshua once observed to him, that he had talked above the capacity of some people with whom they had been in company together. &lsquo;No matter, Sir, (said Johnson); they consider it as a compliment to be talked to, as if they were wiser than they are. So true is this, Sir, that Baxter made it a rule in every sermon that he preached, to say something that was above the capacity of his audience.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson&rsquo;s dexterity in retort, when he seemed to be driven to an extremity by his adversary, was very remarkable. Of his power in this respect, our common friend, Mr. Windham, of Norfolk, has been pleased to furnish me with an eminent instance. However unfavourable to Scotland, he uniformly gave liberal praise to George Buchanan, as a writer. In a conversation concerning the literary merits of the two countries, in which Buchanan was introduced, a Scotchman, imagining that on this ground he should have an undoubted triumph over him, exclaimed, &lsquo;Ah, Dr. Johnson, what would you have said of Buchanan, had he been an Englishman?&rsquo; &lsquo;Why, Sir, (said Johnson, after a little pause,) I should not <span class="t8">have said of Buchanan, had he been an</span> Englishman<span class="t8">, what I will now say of him as a</span> Scotchman<span class="t8">, &mdash; that he was the only man of genius his country ever produced.&rsquo;</span></p>
<p class="p24">And this brings to my recollection another instance of the same nature. I once reminded him that when Dr. Adam Smith was expatiating on the beauty of Glasgow, he had cut him short by saying, &lsquo;Pray, Sir, have you ever seen Brentford?&rsquo; and I took the liberty to add, &lsquo;My dear Sir, surely that was shocking<span class="t8">.&rsquo; &lsquo;Why, then, Sir, (he replied,) YOU have never seen Brentford.&rsquo;</span></p>
<p class="p24">Though his usual phrase for conversation was talk<span class="t8">, yet he made a distinction; for when he once told me that he dined the day before at a friend&rsquo;s house, with &lsquo;a very pretty company;&rsquo; and I asked him if there was good conversation, he answered, &lsquo;No, Sir; we had</span> talk <span class="t8">enough, but no</span> conversation<span class="t8">; there was nothing</span> discussed<span class="t8">.&rsquo;</span></p>
<p class="p24">Talking of the success of the Scotch in London, he imputed it In a considerable degree to their spirit of nationality. &lsquo;You know, Sir, (said he,) that no Scotchman publishes a book, or has a play brought upon the stage, but there are five hundred people ready to applaud him.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He gave much praise to his friend, Dr. Burney&rsquo;s elegant and entertaining travels, and told Mr. Seward that he had them in his eye, when writing his Journey to the Western Islands of Scotland<span class="t8">.</span></p>
<p class="p24">Such was his sensibility, and so much was he affected by pathetick poetry, that, when he was reading Dr. Beattie&rsquo;s Hermit <span class="t8">in my presence, it brought tears into his eyes.</span></p>
<p class="p24">He disapproved much of mingling real facts with fiction. On this account he censured a book entitled Love and Madness<span class="t8">.</span></p>
<p class="p24">Mr. Hoole told him, he was born in Moorfields, and had received part of his early instruction in Grub-street. &lsquo;Sir, (said Johnson, smiling) you have been regularly <span class="t8">educated.&rsquo; Having asked who was his instructor, and Mr. Hoole having answered, &lsquo;My uncle, Sir, who was a taylor;&rsquo; Johnson, recollecting himself, said, &lsquo;Sir, I knew him; we called him the</span> metaphysical taylor<span class="t8">. He was of a club in Old-street, with me and George Psalmanazar, and some others: but pray, Sir, was he a good taylor?&rsquo; Mr. Hoole having answered that he believed he was too mathematical, and used to draw squares and triangles on his shop-board, so that he did not excel in the cut of a coat;&mdash; &lsquo;I am sorry for it (said Johnson,) for I would have every man to be master of his own business.&rsquo;</span></p>
<p class="p24">In pleasant reference to himself and Mr. Hoole, as brother authours, he often said, &lsquo;Let you and I, Sir, go together, and eat a beef-steak in Grub-street.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Sir William Chambers, that great Architect, whose works shew a sublimity of genius, and who is esteemed by all who know him for his social, hospitable, and generous qualities, submitted the manuscript of his Chinese Architecture <span class="t8">to Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s perusal. Johnson was much pleased with it, and said, &lsquo;It wants no addition nor correction, but a few lines of introduction;&rsquo; which he furnished, and Sir William adopted.</span></p>
<p class="p24">He said to Sir William Scott, &lsquo;The age is running mad after innovation; all the business of the world is to be done in a new way; men are to be hanged in a new way; Tyburn itself is not safe from the fury of innovation.&rsquo; It having been argued that this was an improvement,&mdash; &lsquo;No, Sir, (said he, eagerly,) it is not <span class="t8">an improvement: they object that the old method drew together a number of spectators. Sir, executions are intended to draw spectators. If they do not draw spectators they don&rsquo;t answer their purpose. The old method was most satisfactory to all parties; the publick was gratified by a procession; the criminal was supported by it. Why is all this to be swept away?&rsquo; I perfectly agree with Dr. Johnson upon this head, and am persuaded that executions now, the solemn procession being discontinued, have not nearly the effect which they formerly had. Magistrates both in London, and elsewhere, have, I am afraid, in this had too much regard to their own ease.</span></p>
<p class="p24">Of Dr. Hurd, Bishop of Worcester, Johnson said to a friend, &lsquo;Hurd, Sir, is one of a set of men who account for every thing systematically; for instance, it has been a fashion to wear scarlet breeches; these men would tell you, that according to causes and effects, no other wear could at that time have been chosen.&rsquo; He, however, said of him at another time to the same gentleman, &lsquo;Hurd, Sir, is a man whose acquaintance is a valuable acquisition.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">That learned and ingenious Prelate it is well known published at one period of his life Moral and Political Dialogues<span class="t8">, with a woefully whiggish cast. Afterwards, his Lordship having thought better, came to see his errour, and republished the work with a more constitutional spirit. Johnson, however, was unwilling to allow him full credit for his political conversion. I remember when his Lordship declined the honour of being Archbishop of Canterbury, Johnson said, &lsquo;I am glad he did not go to Lambeth; for, after all, I fear he is a Whig in his heart.&rsquo;</span></p>
<p class="p24">Johnson&rsquo;s attention to precision and clearness in expression was very remarkable. He disapproved of parentheses; and I believe in all his voluminous writings, not half a dozen of them will be found. He never used the phrases the former <span class="t8">and</span> the latter<span class="t8">, having observed, that they often occasioned obscurity; he therefore contrived to construct his sentences so as not to have occasion for them, and would even rather repeat the same words, in order to avoid them. Nothing is more common than to mistake surnames when we hear them carelessly uttered for the first time. To prevent this, he used not only to pronounce them slowly and distinctly, but to take the trouble of spelling them; a practice which I have often followed; and which I wish were general.</span></p>
<p class="p24">Such was the heat and irritability of his blood, that not only did he pare his nails to the quick; but scraped the joints of his fingers with a pen-knife, till they seemed quite red and raw.</p>
<p class="p24">The heterogeneous composition of human nature was remarkably exemplified in Johnson. His liberality in giving his money to persons in distress was extraordinary. Yet there lurked about him a propensity to paultry saving. One day I owned to him that &lsquo;I was occasionally troubled with a fit of narrowness<span class="t8">.&rsquo; &lsquo;Why, Sir, (said he,) so am I.</span> But I do not tell it<span class="t8">.&rsquo; He has now and then borrowed a shilling of me; and when I asked for it again, seemed to be rather out of humour. A droll little circumstance once occurred: as if he meant to reprimand my minute exactness as a creditor, he thus addressed me;&mdash; &lsquo;Boswell,</span> lend <span class="t8">me sixpence &mdash; </span>not to be repaid<span class="t8">.&rsquo;</span></p>
<p class="p24">This great man&rsquo;s attention to small things was very remarkable. As an instance of it, he one day said to me, &lsquo;Sir, when you get silver in change for a guinea, look carefully at it; you may find some curious piece of coin.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Though a stern true-born Englishman<span class="t8">, and fully prejudiced against all other nations, he had discernment enough to see, and candour enough to censure, the cold reserve too common among Englishmen towards strangers: &lsquo;Sir, (said he,) two men of any other nation who are shewn into a room together, at a house where they are both visitors, will immediately find some conversation. But two Englishmen will probably go each to a different window, and remain in obstinate silence. Sir, we as yet do not enough understand the common rights of humanity.&rsquo;</span></p>
<p class="p24">Johnson was at a certain period of his life a good deal with the Earl of Shelburne, now Marquis of Lansdown, as he doubtless could not but have a due value for that nobleman&rsquo;s activity of mind, and uncommon acquisitions of important knowledge, however much he might disapprove of other parts of his Lordship&rsquo;s character, which were widely different from his own.</p>
<p class="p24">Maurice Morgann, Esq., authour of the very ingenious Essay on the character of Falstaff<span class="t8">, being a particular friend of his Lordship, had once an opportunity of entertaining Johnson for a day or two at Wickham, when its Lord was absent, and by him I have been favoured with two anecdotes.</span></p>
<p class="p24">One is not a little to the credit of Johnson&rsquo;s candour. Mr. Morgann and he had a dispute pretty late at night, in which Johnson would not give up, though he had the wrong side, and in short, both kept the field. Next morning, when they met in the breakfasting-room, Dr. Johnson accosted Mr. Morgann thus:&mdash; &lsquo;Sir, I have been thinking on our dispute last night &mdash; You were in the right<span class="t8">.&rsquo;</span></p>
<p class="p24">The other was as follows: &mdash; Johnson, for sport perhaps, or from the spirit of contradiction, eagerly maintained that Derrick had merit as a writer. Mr. Morgann argued with him directly, in vain. At length he had recourse to this device. &lsquo;Pray, Sir, (said he,) whether do you reckon Derrick or Smart the best poet?&rsquo; Johnson at once felt himself roused; and answered, &lsquo;Sir, there is no settling the point of precedency between a louse and a flea.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Once, when checking my boasting too frequently of myself in company, he said to me, &lsquo;Boswell, you often vaunt so much, as to provoke ridicule. You put me in mind of a man who was standing in the kitchen of an inn with his back to the fire, and thus accosted the person next him, &ldquo;Do you know, Sir, who I am?&rdquo; &ldquo;No, Sir, (said the other,) I have not that advantage.&rdquo; &ldquo;Sir, (said he,) I am the great <span class="t8">TWALMLEY, who invented the New Floodgate Iron.&rdquo;&rsquo; The Bishop of Killaloe, on my repeating the story to him, defended Twalmley, by observing, that he was entitled to the epithet of</span> great<span class="t8">; for Virgil in his groupe of worthies in the Elysian fields &mdash; </span></p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hic manus ob patriam pugnando vulnera passi<span class="t8">, &amp;c.</span></p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p24">mentions</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inventas aut qui vitam excoluere per artes<span class="t8">606.</span></p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p24">He was pleased to say to me one morning when we were left alone in his study, &lsquo;Boswell, I think I am easier with you than with almost any body.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He would not allow Mr. David Hume any credit for his political principles, though similar to his own; saying of him, &lsquo;Sir, he was a Tory by chance.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">His acute observation of human life made him remark, &lsquo;Sir, there is nothing by which a man exasperates most people more, than by displaying a superiour ability or brilliancy in conversation. They seem pleased at the time; but their envy makes them curse him at their hearts.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">My readers will probably be surprised to hear that the great Dr. Johnson could amuse himself with so slight and playful a species of composition as a Charade<span class="t8">. I have recovered one which he made on Dr.</span> Barnard<span class="t8">, now Lord Bishop of Killaloe; who has been pleased for many years to treat me with so much intimacy and social ease, that I may presume to call him not only my Right Reverend, but my very dear Friend. I therefore with peculiar pleasure give to the world a just and elegant compliment thus paid to his Lordship by Johnson.</span></p>
<p class="p24">CHARADE.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;My first<span class="t8">610 shuts out thieves from your house or your room,</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">My</span> second<span class="t8">611 expresses a Syrian perfume.</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">My</span> whole<span class="t8">612 is a man in whose converse is shar&rsquo;d,</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t8">The strength of a Bar and the sweetness of Nard.&rsquo;</span></p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson asked Richard Owen Cambridge, Esq., if he had read the Spanish translation of Sallust<span class="t8">, said to be written by a Prince of Spain, with the assistance of his tutor, who is professedly the authour of a treatise annexed, on the Phoenician language.</span></p>
<p class="p24">Mr. Cambridge commended the work, particularly as he thought the Translator understood his authour better than is commonly the case with Translators: but said, he was disappointed in the purpose for which he borrowed the book; to see whether a Spaniard could be better furnished with inscriptions from monuments, coins, or other antiquities which he might more probably find on a coast, so immediately opposite to Carthage, than the Antiquaries of any other countries. JOHNSON. &lsquo;I am very sorry you was not gratified in your expectations.&rsquo; CAMBRIDGE. &lsquo;The language would have been of little use, as there is no history existing in that tongue to balance the partial accounts which the Roman writers have left us.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;No, Sir. They have not been partial<span class="t8">, they have told their own story, without shame or regard to equitable treatment of their injured enemy; they had no compunction, no feeling for a Carthaginian. Why, Sir, they would never have borne Virgil&rsquo;s description of Aeneas&rsquo;s treatment of Dido, if she had not been a Carthaginian.&rsquo;</span></p>
<p class="p24">I gratefully acknowledge this and other communications from Mr. Cambridge, whom, if a beautiful villa on the banks of the Thames, a few miles distant from London, a numerous and excellent library, which he accurately knows and reads, a choice collection of pictures, which he understands and relishes, an easy fortune, an amiable family, an extensive circle of friends and acquaintance, distinguished by rank, fashion and genius, a literary fame, various, elegant and still increasing, colloquial talents rarely to be found, and with all these means of happiness, enjoying, when well advanced in years, health and vigour of body, serenity and animation of mind, do not entitle to be addressed fortunate senex!<span class="t8"> I know not to whom, in any age, that expression could with propriety have been used. Long may he live to hear and to feel it!</span></p>
<p class="p24">Johnson&rsquo;s love of little children, which he discovered upon all occasions, calling them &lsquo;pretty dears,&rsquo; and giving them sweetmeats, was an undoubted proof of the real humanity and gentleness of his disposition.</p>
<p class="p24">His uncommon kindness to his servants, and serious concern, not only for their comfort in this world, but their happiness in the next, was another unquestionable evidence of what all, who were intimately acquainted with him, knew to be true.</p>
<p class="p24">Nor would it be just, under this head, to omit the fondness which he shewed for animals which he had taken under his protection. I never shall forget the indulgence with which he treated Hodge, his cat: for whom he himself used to go out and buy oysters, lest the servants having that trouble should take a dislike to the poor creature. I am, unluckily, one of those who have an antipathy to a cat, so that I am uneasy when in the room with one; and I own, I frequently suffered a good deal from the presence of this same Hodge. I recollect him one day scrambling up Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s breast, apparently with much satisfaction, while my friend smiling and half-whistling, rubbed down his back, and pulled him by the tail; and when I observed he was a fine cat, saying, &lsquo;Why yes, Sir, but I have had cats whom I liked better than this;&rsquo; and then as if perceiving Hodge to be out of countenance, adding, &lsquo;but he is a very fine cat, a very fine cat indeed.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">This reminds me of the ludicrous account which he gave Mr. Langton, of the despicable state of a young Gentleman of good family. &lsquo;Sir, when I heard of him last, he was running about town shooting cats.&rsquo; And then in a sort of kindly reverie, he bethought himself of his own favourite cat, and said, &lsquo;But Hodge shan&rsquo;t be shot; no, no, Hodge shall not be shot.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He thought Mr. Beauclerk made a shrewd and judicious&rsquo; remark to Mr. Langton, who, after having been for the first time in company with a well-known wit about town, was warmly admiring and praising him, &lsquo;See him again,&rsquo; said Beauclerk.</p>
<p class="p24">His respect for the Hierarchy, and particularly the Dignitaries of the Church, has been more than once exhibited in the course of this work. Mr. Seward saw him presented to the Archbishop of York, and described his Bow to an ARCH-BISHOP<span class="t8">, as such a studied elaboration of homage, such an extension of limb, such a flexion of body, as have seldom or ever been equalled.</span></p>
<p class="p24">I cannot help mentioning with much regret, that by my own negligence I lost an opportunity of having the history of my family from its founder Thomas Boswell, in 1504, recorded and illustrated by Johnson&rsquo;s pen. Such was his goodness to me, that when I presumed to solicit him for so great a favour, he was pleased to say, &lsquo;Let me have all the materials you can collect, and I will do it both in Latin and English; then let it be printed and copies of it be deposited in various places for security and preservation.&rsquo; I can now only do the best I can to make up for this loss, keeping my great Master steadily in view. Family histories, like the imagines majorum <span class="t8">of the Ancients, excite to virtue; and I wish that they who really have blood, would be more careful to trace and ascertain its course. Some have affected to laugh at the history of the house of Yvery: it would be well if many others would transmit their pedigrees to posterity, with the same accuracy and generous zeal with which the Noble Lord who compiled that work has honoured and perpetuated his ancestry.</span></p>
<p class="p24">On Thursday, April 10, I introduced to him, at his house in Bolt-court, the Honourable and Reverend William Stuart, son of the Earl of Bute; a gentleman truly worthy of being known to Johnson; being, with all the advantages of high birth, learning, travel, and elegant manners, an exemplary parish priest in every respect.</p>
<p class="p24">After some compliments on both sides, the tour which Johnson and I had made to the Hebrides was mentioned. JOHNSON. &lsquo;I got an acquisition of more ideas by it than by any thing that I remember. I saw quite a different system of life.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;You would not like to make the same journey again?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why no, Sir; not the same: it is a tale told. Gravina, an Italian critick, observes, that every man desires to see that of which he has read; but no man desires to read an account of what he has seen: so much does description fall short of reality. Description only excites curiosity: seeing satisfies it. Other people may go and see the Hebrides.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;I should wish to go and see some country totally different from what I have been used to; such as Turkey, where religion and every thing else are different.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Yes, Sir; there are two objects of curiosity, &mdash; the Christian world, and the Mahometan world. All the rest may be considered as barbarous.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Pray, Sir, is the Turkish Spy<span class="t8"> a genuine book?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;No, Sir. Mrs. Manley, in her</span> Life<span class="t8">, says that her father wrote the first two volumes: and in another book,</span> Dunton&rsquo;s Life and Errours<span class="t8">, we find that the rest was written by one</span> Sault<span class="t8">, at two guineas a sheet, under the direction of Dr. Midgeley.</span></p>
<p class="p24">BOSWELL. &lsquo;This has been a very factious reign, owing to the too great indulgence of Government.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;I think so, Sir. What at first was lenity, grew timidity. Yet this is reasoning à posteriori<span class="t8">, and may not be just. Supposing a few had at first been punished, I believe faction would have been crushed; but it might have been said, that it was a sanguinary reign. A man cannot tell</span> à priori <span class="t8">what will be best for Government to do. This reign has been very unfortunate. We have had an unsuccessful war; but that does not prove that we have been ill governed. One side or other must prevail in war, as one or other must win at play. When we beat Louis we were not better governed; nor were the French better governed when Louis beat us.&rsquo;</span></p>
<p class="p24">On Saturday, April 12, I visited him, in company with Mr. Windham, of Norfolk, whom, though a Whig, he highly valued. One of the best things he ever said was to this gentleman; who, before he set out for Ireland as Secretary to Lord Northington, when Lord Lieutenant, expressed to the Sage some modest and virtuous doubts, whether he could bring himself to practise those arts which it is supposed a person in that situation has occasion to employ. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid, Sir, (said Johnson, with a pleasant smile,) you will soon make a very pretty rascal.</p>
<p class="p24">He talked to-day a good deal of the wonderful extent and variety of London, and observed, that men of curious enquiry might see in it such modes of life as very few could even imagine. He in particular recommended to us to explore Wapping<span class="t8">, which we resolved to do.</span></p>
<p class="p24">Mr. Lowe, the painter, who was with him, was very much distressed that a large picture which he had painted was refused to be received into the Exhibition of the Royal Academy. Mrs. Thrale knew Johnson&rsquo;s character so superficially, as to represent him as unwilling to do small acts of benevolence; and mentions in particular, that he would hardly take the trouble to write a letter in favour of his friends. The truth, however, is, that he was remarkable, in an extraordinary degree, for what she denies to him; and, above all, for this very sort of kindness, writing letters for those to whom his solicitations might be of service. He now gave Mr. Lowe the following, of which I was diligent enough, with his permission, to take copies at the next coffee-house, while Mr. Windham was so good as to stay by me.</p>
<p class="p24">TO SIR JOSHUA REYNOLDS.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Mr. Lowe considers himself as cut off from all credit and all hope, by the rejection of his picture from the Exhibition. Upon this work he has exhausted all his powers, and suspended all his expectations: and, certainly, to be refused an opportunity of taking the opinion of the publick, is in itself a very great hardship. It is to be condemned without a trial.</p>
<p class="p24">If you could procure the revocation of this incapacitating edict, you would deliver an unhappy man from great affliction. The Council has sometimes reversed its own determination; and I hope, that by your interposition this luckless picture may be got admitted. I am, &amp;c.</p>
<p class="p24">SAM. JOHNSON.</p>
<p class="p24">April 12, 1783.</p>
<p class="p24">To MR. BARRY.</p>
<p class="p24">SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">Mr. Lowe&rsquo;s exclusion from the exhibition gives him more trouble than you and the other gentlemen of the Council could imagine or intend. He considers disgrace and ruin as the inevitable consequence of your determination.</p>
<p class="p24">He says, that some pictures have been received after rejection; and if there be any such precedent, I earnestly entreat that you will use your interest in his favour. Of his work I can say nothing; I pretend not to judge of painting; and this picture I never saw: but I conceive it extremely hard to shut out any man from the possibility of success; and therefore I repeat my request that you will propose the re-consideration of Mr. Lowe&rsquo;s case; and if there be any among the Council with whom my name can have any weight, be pleased to communicate to them the desire of, Sir, Your most humble servant, SAM. JOHNSON. April 12, 1783.</p>
<p class="p24">Such intercession was too powerful to be resisted; and Mr. Lowe&rsquo;s performance was admitted at Somerset Place. The subject, as I recollect, was the Deluge, at that point of time when the water was verging to the top of the last uncovered mountain. Near to the spot was seen the last of the antediluvian race, exclusive of those who were saved in the ark of Noah. This was one of those giants, then the inhabitants of the earth, who had still strength to swim, and with one of his hands held aloft his infant child. Upon the small remaining dry spot appeared a famished lion, ready to spring at the child and devour it. Mr. Lowe told me that Johnson said to him, &lsquo;Sir, your picture is noble and probable.&rsquo; &lsquo;A compliment, indeed, (said Mr. Lowe,) from a man who cannot lie, and cannot be mistaken.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">About this time he wrote to Mrs. Lucy Porter, mentioning his bad health, and that he intended a visit to Lichfield. &lsquo;It is, (says he,) with no great expectation of amendment that I make every year a journey into the country; but it is pleasant to visit those whose kindness has been often experienced.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On April 18, (being Good-Friday,) I found him at breakfast, in his usual manner upon that day, drinking tea without milk, and eating a cross-bun to prevent faintness; we went to St. Clement&rsquo;s church, as formerly. When we came home from church, he placed himself on one of the stone-seats at his garden-door, and I took the other, and thus in the open air and in a placid frame of mind, he talked away very easily. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Were I a country gentleman, I should not be very hospitable, I should not have crowds in my house.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Sir Alexander Dick tells me, that he remembers having a thousand people in a year to dine at his house: that is, reckoning each person as one, each time that he dined there.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;That, Sir, is about three a day.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;How your statement lessens the idea.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;That, Sir, is the good of counting. It brings every thing to a certainty, which before floated in the mind indefinitely.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;But Omne ignotum pro magnifico est: one is sorry to have this diminished.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, you should not allow yourself to be delighted with errour.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Three a day seem but few.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Nay, Sir, he who entertains three a day, does very liberally. And if there is a large family, the poor entertain those three, for they eat what the poor would get: there must be superfluous meat; it must be given to the poor, or thrown out.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;I observe in London, that the poor go about and gather bones, which I understand are manufactured.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Yes, Sir; they boil them, and extract a grease from them for greasing wheels and other purposes. Of the best pieces they make a mock ivory, which is used for hafts to knives, and various other things; the coarser pieces they burn and pound, and sell the ashes.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;For what purpose, Sir?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, for making a furnace for the chymists for melting iron. A paste made of burnt bones will stand a stronger heat than any thing else. Consider, Sir; if you are to melt iron, you cannot line your pot with brass, because it is softer than iron, and would melt sooner; nor with iron, for though malleable iron is harder than cast iron, yet it would not do; but a paste of burnt-bones will not melt.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Do you know, Sir, I have discovered a manufacture to a great extent, of what you only piddle at, &mdash; scraping and drying the peel of oranges. At a place in Newgate-street, there is a prodigious quantity prepared, which they sell to the distillers.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, I believe they make a higher thing out of them than a spirit; they make what is called orange-butter, the oil of the orange inspissated, which they mix perhaps with common pomatum, and make it fragrant. The oil does not fly off in the drying.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">BOSWELL. &lsquo;I wish to have a good walled garden.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think it would be worth the expence to you. We compute in England, a park wall at a thousand pounds a mile; now a garden-wall must cost at least as much. You intend your trees should grow higher than a deer will leap. Now let us see; for a hundred pounds you could only have forty-four square yards, which is very little; for two hundred pounds, you may have eighty-four square yards, which is very well. But when will you get the value of two hundred pounds of walls, in fruit, in your climate? No, Sir, such contention with Nature is not worth while. I would plant an orchard, and have plenty of such fruit as ripen well in your country. My friend, Dr. Madden, of Ireland, said, that &ldquo;in an orchard there should be enough to eat, enough to lay up, enough to be stolen, and enough to rot upon the ground.&rdquo; Cherries are an early fruit, you may have them; and you may have the early apples and pears.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;We cannot have nonpareils.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, you can no more have nonpareils than you can have grapes.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;We have them, Sir; but they are very bad.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Nay, Sir, never try to have a thing merely to shew that you <span class="t8">cannot</span> have it. From ground that would let for forty shillings you may have a large orchard; and you see it costs you only forty shillings. Nay, you may graze the ground when the trees are grown up; you cannot while they are young.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Is not a good garden a very common thing in England, Sir?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Not so common, Sir, as you imagine. In Lincolnshire there is hardly an orchard; in Staffordshire very little fruit.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Has Langton no orchard?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;No, Sir.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;How so, Sir?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, from the general negligence of the county. He has it not, because nobody else has it.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;A hot-house is a certain thing; I may have that.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;A hot-house is pretty certain; but you must first build it, then you must keep fires in it, and you must have a gardener to take care of it.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;But if I have a gardener at any rate?&mdash; &lsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, yes.&rsquo; BOSWELL.&rsquo; I&rsquo;d have it near my house; there is no need to have it in the orchard.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Yes, I&rsquo;d have it near my house. I would plant a great many currants; the fruit is good, and they make a pretty sweetmeat.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I record this minute detail, which some may think trifling, in order to shew clearly how this great man, whose mind could grasp such large and extensive subjects, as he has shewn in his literary labours, was yet well-informed in the common affairs of life, and loved to illustrate them.</p>
<p class="p24">Mr. Walker, the celebrated master of elocution, came in, and then we went up stairs into the study. I asked him if he had taught many clergymen. JOHNSON. &lsquo;I hope not.&rsquo; WALKER. &lsquo;I have taught only one, and he is the best reader I ever heard, not by my teaching, but by his own natural talents.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Were he the best reader in the world, I would not have it told that he was taught.&rsquo; Here was one of his peculiar prejudices. Could it be any disadvantage to the clergyman to have it known that he was taught an easy and graceful delivery? BOSWELL. &lsquo;Will you not allow, Sir, that a man may be taught to read well?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, so far as to read better than he might do without being taught, yes. Formerly it was supposed that there was no difference in reading, but that one read as well as another.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;It is wonderful to see old Sheridan as enthusiastick about oratory as ever,&rsquo; WALKER. &lsquo;His enthusiasm as to what oratory will do, may be too great: but he reads well.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;He reads well, but he reads low; and you know it is much easier to read low than to read high; for when you read high, you are much more limited, your loudest note can be but one, and so the variety is less in proportion to the loudness. Now some people have occasion to speak to an extensive audience, and must speak loud to be heard.&rsquo; WALKER. &lsquo;The art is to read strong, though low.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Talking of the origin of language; JOHNSON. &lsquo;It must have come by inspiration. A thousand, nay, a million of children could not invent a language. While the organs are pliable, there is not understanding enough to form a language; by the time that there is understanding enough, the organs are become stiff. We know that after a certain age we cannot learn to pronounce a new language. No foreigner, who comes to England when advanced in life, ever pronounces English tolerably well; at least such instances are very rare. When I maintain that language must have come by inspiration, I do not mean that inspiration is required for rhetorick, and all the beauties of language; for when once man has language, we can conceive that he may gradually form modifications of it. I mean only that inspiration seems to me to be necessary to give man the faculty of speech; to inform him that he may have speech; which I think he could no more find out without inspiration, than cows or hogs would think of such a faculty.&rsquo; WALKER. &lsquo;Do you think, Sir, that there are any perfect synonimes in any language?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Originally there were not; but by using words negligently, or in poetry, one word comes to be confounded with another.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He talked of Dr. Dodd. &lsquo;A friend of mine, (said he,) came to me and told me, that a lady wished to have Dr. Dodd&rsquo;s picture in a bracelet, and asked me for a motto. I said, I could think of no better than <span class="t8">Currat Lex</span>. I was very willing to have him pardoned, that is, to have the sentence changed to transportation: but, when he was once hanged, I did not wish he should be made a saint.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Mrs. Burney, wife of his friend Dr. Burney, came in, and he seemed to be entertained with her conversation.</p>
<p class="p24">Garrick&rsquo;s funeral was talked of as extravagantly expensive. Johnson, from his dislike to exaggeration, would not allow that it was distinguished by any extraordinary pomp. &lsquo;Were there not six horses to each coach?&rsquo; said Mrs. Burney. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Madam, there were no more six horses than six phoenixes.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Mrs. Burney wondered that some very beautiful new buildings should be erected in Moorfields, in so shocking a situation as between Bedlam and St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital; and said she could not live there. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Nay, Madam, you see nothing there to hurt you. You no more think of madness by having windows that look to Bedlam, than you think of death by having windows that look to a church-yard.&rsquo; MRS. BURNEY. &lsquo;We may look to a church-yard, Sir; for it is right that we should be kept in mind of death.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Nay, Madam, if you go to that, it is right that we should be kept in mind of madness, which is occasioned by too much indulgence of imagination. I think a very moral use may be made of these new buildings: I would have those who have heated imaginations live there, and take warning.&rsquo; MRS. BURNEY. &lsquo;But, Sir, many of the poor people that are mad, have become so from disease, or from distressing events. It is, therefore, not their fault, but their misfortune; and, therefore, to think of them is a melancholy consideration.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Time passed on in conversation till it was too late for the service of the church at three o&rsquo;clock. I took a walk, and left him alone for some time; then returned, and we had coffee and conversation again by ourselves.</p>
<p class="p24">I stated the character of a noble friend of mine, as a curious case for his opinion:&mdash; &lsquo;He is the most inexplicable man to me that I ever knew. Can you explain him, Sir? He is, I really believe, noble-minded, generous, and princely. But his most intimate friends may be separated from him for years, without his ever asking a question concerning them. He will meet them with a formality, a coldness, a stately indifference; but when they come close to him, and fairly engage him in conversation, they find him as easy, pleasant, and kind, as they could wish. One then supposes that what is so agreeable will soon be renewed; but stay away from him for half a year, and he will neither call on you, nor send to inquire about you.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, I cannot ascertain his character exactly, as I do not know him; but I should not like to have such a man for my friend. He may love study, and wish not to be interrupted by his friends; <span class="t8">Amici fures temporis</span>. He may be a frivolous man, and be so much occupied with petty pursuits, that he may not want friends. Or he may have a notion that there is a dignity in appearing indifferent, while he in fact may not be more indifferent at his heart than another.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">We went to evening prayers at St. Clement&rsquo;s, at seven, and then parted.</p>
<p class="p24">On Sunday, April 20, being Easter-day, after attending solemn service at St. Paul&rsquo;s, I came to Dr. Johnson, and found Mr. Lowe, the painter, sitting with him. Mr. Lowe mentioned the great number of new buildings of late in London, yet that Dr. Johnson had observed, that the number of inhabitants was not increased. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, the bills of mortality prove that no more people die now than formerly; so it is plain no more live. The register of births proves nothing, for not one tenth of the people of London are born there.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;I believe, Sir, a great many of the children born in London die early.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, yes, Sir.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;But those who do live, are as stout and strong people as any: Dr. Price says, they must be naturally stronger to get through.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;That is system, Sir. A great traveller observes, that it is said there are no weak or deformed people among the Indians; but he with much sagacity assigns the reason of this, which is, that the hardship of their life as hunters and fishers does not allow weak or diseased children to grow up. Now had I been an Indian, I must have died early; my eyes would not have served me to get food. I indeed now could fish, give me English tackle; but had I been an Indian I must have starved, or they would have knocked me on the head, when they saw I could do nothing.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Perhaps they would have taken care of you: we are told they are fond of oratory, you would have talked to them.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Nay, Sir, I should not have lived long enough to be fit to talk; I should have been dead before I was ten years old. Depend upon it, Sir, a savage, when he is hungry, will not carry about with him a looby of nine years old, who cannot help himself. They have no affection, Sir.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;I believe natural affection, of which we hear so much, is very small.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, natural affection is nothing: but affection from principle and established duty is sometimes wonderfully strong.&rsquo; LOWE. &lsquo;A hen, Sir, will feed her chickens in preference to herself.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;But we don&rsquo;t know that the hen is hungry; let the hen be fairly hungry, and I&rsquo;ll warrant she&rsquo;ll peck the corn herself. A cock, I believe, will feed hens instead of himself; but we don&rsquo;t know that the cock is hungry.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;And that, Sir, is not from affection but gallantry. But some of the Indians have affection.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, that they help some of their children is plain; for some of them live, which they could not do without being helped.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I dined with him; the company were, Mrs. Williams, Mrs. Desmoulins, and Mr. Lowe. He seemed not to be well, talked little, grew drowsy soon after dinner, and retired, upon which I went away.</p>
<p class="p24">Having next day gone to Mr. Burke&rsquo;s seat in the country, from whence I was recalled by an express, that a near relation of mine had killed his antagonist in a duel, and was himself dangerously wounded, I saw little of Dr. Johnson till Monday, April 28, when I spent a considerable part of the day with him, and introduced the subject, which then chiefly occupied my mind. JOHNSON. &lsquo;I do not see, Sir, that fighting is absolutely forbidden in Scripture; I see revenge forbidden, but not self-defence.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;The Quakers say it is; &ldquo;Unto him that smiteth thee on one cheek, offer him also the other.&rdquo;&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;But stay, Sir; the text is meant only to have the effect of moderating passion; it is plain that we are not to take it in a literal sense. We see this from the context, where there are other recommendations, which I warrant you the Quaker will not take literally; as, for instance, &ldquo;From him that would borrow of thee, turn thou not away.&rdquo; Let a man whose credit is bad, come to a Quaker, and say, &ldquo;Well, Sir, lend me a hundred pounds;&rdquo; he&rsquo;ll find him as unwilling as any other man. No, Sir, a man may shoot the man who invades his character, as he may shoot him who attempts to break into his house. So in 1745, my friend, Tom Cumming the Quaker, said, he would not fight, but he would drive an ammunition cart; and we know that the Quakers have sent flannel waistcoats to our soldiers, to enable them to fight better.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;When a man is the aggressor, and by ill-usage forces on a duel in which he is killed, have we not little ground to hope that he is gone into a state of happiness?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, we are not to judge determinately of the state in which a man leaves this life. He may in a moment have repented effectually, and it is possible may have been accepted by GOD. There is in <span class="t8">Camden&rsquo;s Remains</span>, an epitaph upon a very wicked man, who was killed by a fall from his horse, in which he is supposed to say,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;&ldquo;Between the stirrup and the ground,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mercy ask&rsquo;d, I mercy found652.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">BOSWELL. &lsquo;Is not the expression in the Burial-service, &ldquo;in the <span class="t8">sure</span> and <span class="t8">certain</span> hope of a blessed resurrection,&rdquo; too strong to be used indiscriminately, and, indeed, sometimes when those over whose bodies it is said, have been notoriously profane?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;It is sure and certain <span class="t8">hope</span>, Sir; not <span class="t8">belief</span>.&rsquo; I did not insist further; but cannot help thinking that less positive words would be more proper.</p>
<p class="p24">Talking of a man who was grown very fat, so as to be incommoded with corpulency; he said, &lsquo;He eats too much, Sir.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know, Sir; you will see one man fat who eats moderately, and another lean who eats a great deal.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Nay, Sir, whatever may be the quantity that a man eats, it is plain that if he is too fat, he has eaten more than he should have done. One man may have a digestion that consumes food better than common; but it is certain that solidity is encreased by putting something to it.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;But may not solids swell and be distended?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Yes, Sir, they may swell and be distended; but that is not fat.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">We talked of the accusation against a gentleman for supposed delinquencies in India. JOHNSON. &lsquo;What foundation there is for accusation I know not, but they will not get at him. Where bad actions are committed at so great a distance, a delinquent can obscure the evidence till the scent becomes cold; there is a cloud between, which cannot be penetrated: therefore all distant power is bad. I am clear that the best plan for the government of India is a despotick governour; for if he be a good man, it is evidently the best government; and supposing him to be a bad man, it is better to have one plunderer than many. A governour whose power is checked, lets others plunder, that he himself may be allowed to plunder; but if despotick, he sees that the more he lets others plunder, the less there will be for himself, so he restrains them; and though he himself plunders, the country is a gainer, compared with being plundered by numbers.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I mentioned the very liberal payment which had been received for reviewing; and, as evidence of this, that it had been proved in a trial, that Dr. Shebbeare had received six guineas a sheet for that kind of literary labour. JOHNSON, &lsquo;Sir, he might get six guineas for a particular sheet, but not <span class="t8">communibus sheetibus</span>.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Pray, Sir, by a sheet of review is it meant that it shall be all of the writer&rsquo;s own composition? or are extracts, made from the book reviewed, deducted.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;No, Sir: it is a sheet, no matter of what.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;I think that it is not reasonable.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Yes, Sir, it is. A man will more easily write a sheet all his own, than read an octavo volume to get extracts.&rsquo; To one of Johnson&rsquo;s wonderful fertility of mind I believe writing was really easier than reading and extracting; but with ordinary men the case is very different. A great deal, indeed, will depend upon the care and judgement with which the extracts are made. I can suppose the operation to be tedious and difficult: but in many instances we must observe crude morsels cut out of books as if at random; and when a large extract is made from one place, it surely may be done with very little trouble. One however, I must acknowledge, might be led, from the practice of reviewers, to suppose that they take a pleasure in original writing; for we often find, that instead of giving an accurate account of what has been done by the authour whose work they are reviewing, which is surely the proper business of a literary journal, they produce some plausible and ingenious conceits of their own, upon the topicks which have been discussed.</p>
<p class="p24">Upon being told that old Mr. Sheridan, indignant at the neglect of his oratorical plans, had threatened to go to America; JOHNSON. &lsquo;I hope he will go to America.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;The Americans don&rsquo;t want oratory.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;But we can want Sheridan.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Monday, April 29, I found him at home in the forenoon, and Mr. Seward with him. Horace having been mentioned; BOSWELL. &lsquo;There is a great deal of thinking in his works. One finds there almost every thing but religion.&rsquo; SEWARD. &lsquo;He speaks of his returning to it, in his Ode <span class="t8">Parcus Deorum cultor et infrequens</span> JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, he was not in earnest: this was merely poetical.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;There are, I am afraid, many people who have no religion at all.&rsquo; SEWARD. &lsquo;And sensible people too.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, not sensible in that respect. There must be either a natural or a moral stupidity, if one lives in a total neglect of so very important a concern.&rsquo; SEWARD. &lsquo;I wonder that there should be people without religion.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, you need not wonder at this, when you consider how large a proportion of almost every man&rsquo;s life is passed without thinking of it. I myself was for some years totally regardless of religion. It had dropped out of my mind. It was at an early part of my life. Sickness brought it back, and I hope I have never lost it since.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;My dear Sir, what a man must you have been without religion! Why you must have gone on drinking, and swearing, and&mdash; &lsquo; JOHNSON. (with a smile) &lsquo;I drank enough and swore enough, to be sure.&rsquo; SEWARD. &lsquo;One should think that sickness and the view of death would make more men religious.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, they do not know how to go about it: they have not the first notion. A man who has never had religion before, no more grows religious when he is sick, than a man who has never learnt figures can count when he has need of calculation.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I mentioned a worthy friend of ours whom we valued much, but observed that he was too ready to introduce religious discourse upon all occasions. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, yes, Sir, he will introduce religious discourse without seeing whether it will end in instruction and improvement, or produce some profane jest. He would introduce it in the company of Wilkes, and twenty more such.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I mentioned Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s excellent distinction between liberty of conscience and liberty of teaching. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Consider, Sir; if you have children whom you wish to educate in the principles of the Church of England, and there comes a Quaker who tries to pervert them to his principles, you would drive away the Quaker. You would not trust to the predomination of right, which you believe is in your opinions; you would keep wrong out of their heads. Now the vulgar are the children of the State. If any one attempts to teach them doctrines contrary to what the State approves, the magistrate may and ought to restrain him.&rsquo; SEWARD. &lsquo;Would you restrain private conversation, Sir?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, it is difficult to say where private conversation begins, and where it ends. If we three should discuss even the great question concerning the existence of a Supreme Being by ourselves, we should not be restrained; for that would be to put an end to all improvement. But if we should discuss it in the presence of ten boarding-school girls, and as many boys, I think the magistrate would do well to put us in the stocks, to finish the debate there.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Lord Hailes had sent him a present of a curious little printed poem, on repairing the University of Aberdeen, by David Malloch, which he thought would please Johnson, as affording clear evidence that Mallet had appeared even as a literary character by the name of <span class="t8">Malloch</span>; his changing which to one of softer sound, had given Johnson occasion to introduce him into his <span class="t8">Dictionary</span>, under the article <span class="t8">Alias</span>. This piece was, I suppose, one of Mallet&rsquo;s first essays. It is preserved in his works, with several variations. Johnson having read aloud, from the beginning of it, where there were some common-place assertions as to the superiority of ancient times;&mdash; &lsquo;How false (said he) is all this, to say that in ancient times learning was not a disgrace to a Peer as it is now. In ancient times a Peer was as ignorant as any one else. He would have been angry to have it thought he could write his name. Men in ancient times dared to stand forth with a degree of ignorance with which nobody would dare now to stand forth. I am always angry when I hear ancient times praised at the expence of modern times. There is now a great deal more learning in the world than there was formerly; for it is universally diffused. You have, perhaps, no man who knows as much Greek and Latin as Bentley; no man who knows as much mathematicks as Newton: but you have many more men who know Greek and Latin, and who know mathematicks.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Thursday, May 1, I visited him in the evening along with young Mr. Burke. He said, &lsquo;It is strange that there should be so little reading in the world, and so much writing. People in general do not willingly read, if they can have any thing else to amuse them. There must be an external impulse; emulation, or vanity, or avarice. The progress which the understanding makes through a book, has more pain than pleasure in it. Language is scanty, and inadequate to express the nice gradations and mixtures of our feelings. No man reads a book of science from pure inclination. The books that we do read with pleasure are light compositions, which contain a quick succession of events. However, I have this year read all Virgil through. I read a book of the <span class="t8">Aeneid</span> every night, so it was done in twelve nights, and I had great delight in it. The <span class="t8">Georgicks</span> did not give me so much pleasure, except the fourth book. The <span class="t8">Eclogues</span> I have almost all by heart. I do not think the story of the <span class="t8">Aeneid</span> interesting. I like the story of the <span class="t8">Odyssey</span> much better; and this not on account of the wonderful things which it contains; for there are wonderful things enough in the <span class="t8">Aeneid</span>; &mdash; the ships of the Trojans turned to sea-nymphs, &mdash; the tree at Polydorus&rsquo;s tomb dropping blood. The story of the <span class="t8">Odyssey</span> is interesting, as a great part of it is domestick. It has been said, there is pleasure in writing, particularly in writing verses. I allow you may have pleasure from writing, after it is over, if you have written well; but you don&rsquo;t go willingly to it again. I know when I have been writing verses, I have run my finger down the margin, to see how many I had made, and how few I had to make.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He seemed to be in a very placid humour, and although I have no note of the particulars of young Mr. Burke&rsquo;s conversation, it is but justice to mention in general, that it was such that Dr. Johnson said to me afterwards, &lsquo;He did very well indeed; I have a mind to tell his father.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;TO SIR JOSHUA REYNOLDS.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The gentleman who waits on you with this, is Mr. Cruikshanks, who wishes to succeed his friend Dr. Hunter as Professor of Anatomy in the Royal Academy. His qualifications are very generally known, and it adds dignity to the institution that such men are candidates.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am, Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your most humble servant,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;May 2, 1783.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I have no minute of any interview with Johnson till Thursday, May 15, when I find what follows: &mdash; BOSWELL. &lsquo;I wish much to be in Parliament, Sir.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, unless you come resolved to support any administration, you would be the worse for being in Parliament, because you would be obliged to live more expensively.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Perhaps, Sir, I should be the less happy for being in Parliament. I never would sell my vote, and I should be vexed if things went wrong.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;That&rsquo;s cant, Sir. It would not vex you more in the house, than in the gallery: publick affairs vex no man.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Have not they vexed yourself a little, Sir? Have not you been vexed by all the turbulence of this reign, and by that absurd vote of the House of Commons, &ldquo;That the influence of the Crown has increased, is increasing, and ought to be diminished?&rdquo;&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, I have never slept an hour less, nor eat an ounce less meat. I would have knocked the factious dogs on the head, to be sure; but I was not <span class="t8">vexed</span>.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;I declare, Sir, upon my honour, I did imagine I was vexed, and took a pride in it; but it <span class="t8">was</span>, perhaps, cant; for I own I neither ate less, nor slept less.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;My dear friend, clear your <span class="t8">mind</span> of cant. You may <span class="t8">talk</span> as other people do: you may say to a man, &ldquo;Sir, I am your most humble servant.&rdquo; You are not his most humble servant. You may say, &ldquo;These are bad times; it is a melancholy thing to be reserved to such times.&rdquo; You don&rsquo;t mind the times. You tell a man, &ldquo;I am sorry you had such bad weather the last day of your journey, and were so much wet.&rdquo; You don&rsquo;t care six-pence whether he is wet or dry. You may <span class="t8">talk</span> in this manner; it is a mode of talking in Society; but don&rsquo;t <span class="t8">think</span> foolishly.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I talked of living in the country. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t set up for what is called hospitality; it is a waste of time, and a waste of money; you are eaten up, and not the more respected for your liberality. If your house be like an inn, nobody cares for you. A man who stays a week with another, makes him a slave for a week.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;But there are people, Sir, who make their houses a home to their guests, and are themselves quite easy.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Then, Sir, home must be the same to the guests, and they need not come.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Here he discovered a notion common enough in persons not much accustomed to entertain company, that there must be a degree of elaborate attention, otherwise company will think themselves neglected; and such attention is no doubt very fatiguing. He proceeded: &lsquo;I would not, however, be a stranger in my own county; I would visit my neighbours, and receive their visits; but I would not be in haste to return visits. If a gentleman comes to see me, I tell him he does me a great deal of honour. I do not go to see him perhaps for ten weeks; then we are very complaisant to each other. No, Sir, you will have much more influence by giving or lending money where it is wanted, than by hospitality.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Saturday, May 17, I saw him for a short time. Having mentioned that I had that morning been with old Mr. Sheridan, he remembered their former intimacy with a cordial warmth, and said to me, &lsquo;Tell Mr. Sheridan, I shall be glad to see him, and shake hands with him.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;It is to me very wonderful that resentment should be kept up so long.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, it is not altogether resentment that he does not visit me; it is partly falling out of the habit, &mdash; partly disgust, as one has at a drug that has made him sick. Besides, he knows that I laugh at his oratory.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Another day I spoke of one of our friends, of whom he, as well as I, had a very high opinion. He expatiated in his praise; but added, &lsquo;Sir, he is a cursed Whig, a <span class="t8">bottomless</span> Whig, as they all are now.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I mentioned my expectations from the interest of an eminent person then in power; adding, &lsquo;but I have no claim but the claim of friendship; however, some people will go a great way from that motive.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, they will go all the way from that motive.&rsquo; A gentleman talked of retiring. &lsquo;Never think of that,&rsquo; said Johnson. The gentleman urged, &lsquo;I should then do no ill.&rsquo; JOHNSON. Nor no good either. Sir, it would be a civil suicide.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Monday, May 26, I found him at tea, and the celebrated Miss Burney, the authour of <span class="t8">Evelina</span> and <span class="t8">Cecilia</span>, with him. I asked if there would be any speakers in Parliament, if there were no places to be obtained. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Yes, Sir. Why do you speak here? Either to instruct and entertain, which is a benevolent motive; or for distinction, which is a selfish motive.&rsquo; I mentioned <span class="t8">Cecilia</span>. JOHNSON. (with an air of animated satisfaction) &lsquo;Sir, if you talk of <span class="t8">Cecilia</span>, talk on.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">We talked of Mr. Barry&rsquo;s exhibition of his pictures. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Whatever the hand may have done, the mind has done its part. There is a grasp of mind there which you find nowhere else.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I asked whether a man naturally virtuous, or one who has overcome wicked inclinations, is the best. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, to <span class="t8">you</span>, the man who has overcome wicked inclinations is not the best. He has more merit to <span class="t8">himself</span>: I would rather trust my money to a man who has no hands, and so a physical impossibility to steal, than to a man of the most honest principles. There is a witty satirical story of Foote. He had a small bust of Garrick placed upon his bureau, &ldquo;You may be surprized (said he) that I allow him to be so near my gold; &mdash; but you will observe he has no hands.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Friday, May 29, being to set out for Scotland next morning, I passed a part of the day with him in more than usual earnestness; as his health was in a more precarious state than at any time when I had parted from him. He, however, was quick and lively, and critical as usual. I mentioned one who was a very learned man. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Yes, Sir, he has a great deal of learning; but it never lies straight. There is never one idea by the side of another; &rsquo;tis all entangled: and then he drives it so aukwardly upon conversation.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I stated to him an anxious thought, by which a sincere Christian might be disturbed, even when conscious of having lived a good life, so far as is consistent with human infirmity; he might fear that he should afterwards fall away, and be guilty of such crimes as would render all his former religion vain. Could there be, upon this aweful subject, such a thing as balancing of accounts? Suppose a man who has led a good life for seven years, commits an act of wickedness, and instantly dies; will his former good life have any effect in his favour? JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, if a man has led a good life for seven years, and then is hurried by passion to do what is wrong, and is suddenly carried off, depend upon it he will have the reward of his seven years&rsquo; good life; GOD will not take a catch of him. Upon this principle Richard Baxter believes that a Suicide may be saved. &ldquo;If, (says he) it should be objected that what I maintain may encourage suicide, I answer, I am not to tell a lie to prevent it.&rdquo;&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;But does not the text say, &ldquo;As the tree falls, so it must lie?&rdquo;&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Yes, Sir; as the tree falls: but, &mdash; (after a little pause) &mdash; that is meant as to the general state of the tree, not what is the effect of a sudden blast.&rsquo; In short, he interpreted the expression as referring to condition, not to position. The common notion, therefore, seems to be erroneous; and Shenstone&rsquo;s witty remark on Divines trying to give the tree a jerk upon a death-bed, to make it lie favourably, is not well founded.</p>
<p class="p24">I asked him what works of Richard Baxter&rsquo;s I should read. He said, &lsquo;Read any of them; they are all good.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He said, &lsquo;Get as much force of mind as you can. Live within your income. Always have something saved at the end of the year. Let your imports be more than your exports, and you&rsquo;ll never go far wrong.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I assured him, that in the extensive and various range of his acquaintance there never had been any one who had a more sincere respect and affection for him than I had. He said, &lsquo;I believe it, Sir. Were I in distress, there is no man to whom I should sooner come than to you. I should like to come and have a cottage in your park, toddle about, live mostly on milk, and be taken care of by Mrs. Boswell. She and I are good friends now; are we not?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Talking of devotion, he said, &lsquo;Though it be true that &ldquo;GOD dwelleth not in temples made with hands,&rdquo; yet in this state of being, our minds are more piously affected in places appropriated to divine worship, than in others. Some people have a particular room in their house, where they say their prayers; of which I do not disapprove, as it may animate their devotion.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He embraced me, and gave me his blessing, as usual when I was leaving him for any length of time. I walked from his door to-day, with a fearful apprehension of what might happen before I returned.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To THE RIGHT HONOURABLE WILLIAM WINDHAM.</p>
<p class="p24">Sir, The bringer of this letter is the father of Miss Philips, a singer, who comes to try her voice on the stage at Dublin.</p>
<p class="p24">Mr. Philips is one of my old friends; and as I am of opinion that neither he nor his daughter will do any thing that can disgrace their benefactors, I take the liberty of entreating you to countenance and protect them so far as may be suitable to your station and character; and shall consider myself as obliged by any favourable notice which they shall have the honour of receiving from you.</p>

<p class="p24">SAM JOHNSON. London, May 31, 1783.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">The following is another instance of his active benevolence: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To SIR JOSHUA REYNOLDS.</p>
<p class="p24">DEAR SIR, I have sent you some of my god-son&rsquo;s performances, of which I do not pretend to form any opinion. When I took the liberty of mentioning him to you, I did not know what I have since been told, that Mr. Moser had admitted him among the Students of the Academy. What more can be done for him I earnestly entreat you to consider; for I am very desirous that he should derive some advantage from my connection with him. If you are inclined to see him, I will bring him to wait on you, at any time that you shall be pleased to appoint.</p>
<p class="p24">I am, Sir, Your most humble servant,</p>
<p class="p24">SAM. JOHNSON. June 2, 1783.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">My anxious apprehensions at parting with him this year proved to be but too well founded; for not long afterwards he had a dreadful stroke of the palsy, of which there are very full and accurate accounts in letters written by himself, to shew with what composure of mind, and resignation to the Divine Will, his steady piety enabled him to behave.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;TO MR. EDMUND ALLEN.</p>
<p class="p24">DEAR SIR, It has pleased GOD, this morning, to deprive me of the powers of speech; and as I do not know but that it may be his further good pleasure to deprive me soon of my senses, I request you will on the receipt of this note, come to me, and act for me, as the exigencies of my case may require.</p>
<p class="p24">I am, Sincerely yours,</p>
<p class="p24">SAM. JOHNSON. June 17, 1783.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;TO THE REVEREND DR. JOHN TAYLOR.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;DEAR SIR, It has pleased GOD, by a Paralytick stroke in the night, to deprive me of speech.</p>
<p class="p24">I am very desirous of Dr. Heberden&rsquo;s assistance, as I think my case is not past remedy. Let me see you as soon as it is possible. Bring Dr. Heberden with you, if you can; but come yourself at all events. I am glad you are so well, when I am so dreadfully attacked.</p>
<p class="p24">I think that by a speedy application of stimulants much may be done. I question if a vomit, vigorous and rough, would not rouse the organs of speech to action. As it is too early to send, I will try to recollect what I can, that can be suspected to have brought on this dreadful distress.</p>
<p class="p24">I have been accustomed to bleed frequently for an asthmatick complaint; but have forborne for some time by Dr. Pepys&rsquo;s persuasion, who perceived my legs beginning to swell. I sometimes alleviate a painful, or more properly an oppressive, constriction of my chest, by opiates; and have lately taken opium frequently, but the last, or two last times, in smaller quantities. My largest dose is three grains, and last night I took but two. You will suggest these things (and they are all that I can call to mind) to Dr. Heberden.</p>
<p class="p24">I am, &amp;c. SAM. JOHNSON. June 17, 1783.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Two days after he wrote thus to Mrs. Thrale: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;On Monday, the 16th, I sat for my picture, and walked a considerable way with little inconvenience. In the afternoon and evening I felt myself light and easy, and began to plan schemes of life. Thus I went to bed, and in a short time waked and sat up, as has been long my custom, when I felt a confusion and indistinctness in my head, which lasted, I suppose, about half a minute. I was alarmed, and prayed God, that however he might afflict my body, he would spare my understanding. This prayer, that I might try the integrity of my faculties, I made in Latin verse. The lines were not very good, but I knew them not to be very good: I made them easily, and concluded myself to be unimpaired in my faculties.</p>
<p class="p24">Soon after I perceived that I had suffered a paralytick stroke, and that my speech was taken from me. I had no pain, and so little dejection in this dreadful state, that I wondered at my own apathy, and considered that perhaps death itself, when it should come, would excite less horrour than seems now to attend it.</p>
<p class="p24">In order to rouse the vocal organs, I took two drams. Wine has been celebrated for the production of eloquence. I put myself into violent motion, and I think repeated it; but all was vain. I then went to bed, and strange as it may seem, I think slept. When I saw light, it was time to contrive what I should do. Though God stopped my speech, he left me my hand; I enjoyed a mercy which was not granted to my dear friend Lawrence, who now perhaps overlooks me as I am writing, and rejoices that I have what he wanted. My first note was necessarily to my servant, who came in talking, and could not immediately comprehend why he should read what I put into his hands.</p>
<p class="p24">I then wrote a card to Mr. Allen, that I might have a discreet friend at hand, to act as occasion should require. In penning this note, I had some difficulty; my hand, I knew not how nor why, made wrong letters. I then wrote to Dr. Taylor to come to me, and bring Dr. Heberden; and I sent to Dr. Brocklesby, who is my neighbour. My physicians are very friendly, and give me great hopes; but you may imagine my situation. I have so far recovered my vocal powers, as to repeat the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer with no very imperfect articulation. My memory, I hope, yet remains as it was; but such an attack produces solicitude for the safety of every faculty.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To MR. THOMAS DAVIES.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;DEAR SIR, I have had, indeed, a very heavy blow; but GOD, who yet spares my life, I humbly hope will spare my understanding, and restore my speech. As I am not at all helpless, I want no particular assistance, but am strongly affected by Mrs. Davies&rsquo;s tenderness; and when I think she can do me good, shall be very glad to call upon her. I had ordered friends to be shut out; but one or two have found the way in; and if you come you shall be admitted: for I know not whom I can see, that will bring more amusement on his tongue, or more kindness in his heart. I am, &amp;c.</p>
<p class="p24">SAM. JOHNSON. June 18, 1783.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">It gives me great pleasure to preserve such a memorial of Johnson&rsquo;s regard for Mr. Davies, to whom I was indebted for my introduction to him. He indeed loved Davies cordially, of which I shall give the following little evidence. One day when he had treated him with too much asperity. Tom, who was not without pride and spirit, went off in a passion; but he had hardly reached home, when Frank, who had been sent after him, delivered this note:&mdash; &lsquo;Come, come, dear Davies, I am always sorry when we quarrel; send me word that we are friends.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To JAMES BOSWELL, ESQ.</p>
<p class="p24">DEAR SIR, Your anxiety about my health is very friendly, and very agreeable with your general kindness. I have, indeed, had a very frightful blow. On the 17th of last month, about three in the morning, as near as I can guess, I perceived myself almost totally deprived of speech. I had no pain. My organs were so obstructed, that I could say <span class="t8">no</span>, but could scarcely say <span class="t8">yes</span>. I wrote the necessary directions, for it pleased GOD to spare my hand, and sent for Dr. Heberden and Dr. Brocklesby. Between the time in which I discovered my own disorder, and that in which I sent for the doctors, I had, I believe, in spite of my surprize and solicitude, a little sleep, and Nature began to renew its operations. They came, and gave the directions which the disease required, and from that time I have been continually improving in articulation. I can now speak, but the nerves are weak, and I cannot continue discourse long; but strength, I hope, will return. The physicians consider me as cured. I was last Sunday at church. On Tuesday I took an airing to Hampstead, and dined with THE CLUB, where Lord Palmerston was proposed, and, against my opinion, was rejected. I designed to go next week with Mr. Langton to Rochester, where I purpose to stay about ten days, and then try some other air. I have many kind invitations. Your brother has very frequently enquired after me. Most of my friends have, indeed, been very attentive. Thank dear Lord Hailes for his present.</p>
<p class="p24">I hope you found at your return every thing gay and prosperous, and your lady, in particular, quite recovered and confirmed. Pay her my respects.</p>
<p class="p24">I am, dear Sir, Your most humble servant, SAM. JOHNSON. London, July 3,</p>
<p class="p24">1783.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To MRS. LUCY PORTER, IN LICHFIELD.</p>
<p class="p24">DEAR MADAM, The account which you give of your health is but melancholy. May it please GOD to restore you. My disease affected my speech, and still continues, in some degree, to obstruct my utterance; my voice is distinct enough for a while; but the organs being still weak are quickly weary: but in other respects I am, I think, rather better than I have lately been; and can let you know my state without the help of any other hand.</p>
<p class="p24">In the opinion of my friends, and in my own, I am gradually mending. The Physicians consider me as cured; and I had leave, four days ago, to wash the cantharides from my head. Last Tuesday I dined at THE CLUB.</p>
<p class="p24">I am going next week into Kent, and purpose to change the air frequently this summer; whether I shall wander so far as Staffordshire I cannot tell. I should be glad to come. Return my thanks to Mrs. Cobb, and Mr. Pearson, and all that have shewn attention to me.</p>
<p class="p24">Let us, my dear, pray for one another, and consider our sufferings as notices mercifully given us to prepare ourselves for another state.</p>
<p class="p24">I live now but in a melancholy way. My old friend Mr. Levett is dead, who lived with me in the house, and was useful and companionable; Mrs. Desmoulins is gone away; and Mrs. Williams is so much decayed, that she can add little to another&rsquo;s gratifications. The world passes away, and we are passing with it; but there is, doubtless, another world, which will endure for ever. Let us all fit ourselves for it.</p>
<p class="p24">I am, &amp;c., SAM. JOHNSON. London, July 5, 1783.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Such was the general vigour of his constitution, that he recovered from this alarming and severe attack with wonderful quickness; so that in July he was able to make a visit to Mr. Langton at Rochester, where he passed about a fortnight, and made little excursions as easily as at any time of his life. In August he went as far as the neighbourhood of Salisbury, to Heale, the seat of William Bowles, Esq., a gentleman whom I have heard him praise for exemplary religious order in his family. In his diary I find a short but honourable mention of this visit: &lsquo;August 28, I came to Heale without fatigue. 30. I am entertained quite to my mind.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To DR. BROCKLESBY. Heale, near Salisbury, Aug. 29, 1783.</p>
<p class="p24">DEAR SIR, Without appearing to want a just sense of your kind attention, I cannot omit to give an account of the day which seemed to appear in some sort perilous. I rose at five and went out at six, and having reached Salisbury about nine, went forward a few miles in my friend&rsquo;s chariot. I was no more wearied with the journey, though it was a high-hung, rough coach, than I should have been forty years ago. We shall now see what air will do. The country is all a plain; and the house in which I am, so far as I can judge from my window, for I write before I have left my chamber, is sufficiently pleasant.</p>
<p class="p24">Be so kind as to continue your attention to Mrs. Williams; it is great consolation to the well, and still greater to the sick, that they find themselves not neglected; and I know that you will be desirous of giving comfort even where you have no great hope of giving help.</p>
<p class="p24">Since I wrote the former part of the letter, I find that by the course of the post I cannot send it before the thirty-first.</p>
<p class="p24">I am, &amp;c. SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">While he was here he had a letter from Dr. Brocklesby, acquainting him of the death of Mrs. Williams, which affected him a good deal. Though for several years her temper had not been complacent, she had valuable qualities, and her departure left a blank in his house. Upon this occasion he, according to his habitual course of piety, composed a prayer.</p>
<p class="p24">I shall here insert a few particulars concerning him, with which I have been favoured by one of his friends.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;He had once conceived the design of writing the Life of Oliver Cromwell, saying, that he thought it must be highly curious to trace his extraordinary rise to the supreme power, from so obscure a beginning. He at length laid aside his scheme, on discovering that all that can be told of him is already in print; and that it is impracticable to procure any authentick information in addition to what the world is already possessed of.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;He had likewise projected, but at what part of his life is not known, a work to shew how small a quantity of REAL FICTION there is in the world; and that the same images, with very little variation, have served all the authours who have ever written.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;His thoughts in the latter part of his life were frequently employed on his deceased friends. He often muttered these, or such like sentences: &ldquo;Poor man! and then he died.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Speaking of a certain literary friend, &ldquo;He is a very pompous puzzling fellow, (said he); he lent me a letter once that somebody had written to him, no matter what it was about; but he wanted to have the letter back, and expressed a mighty value for it; he hoped it was to be met with again, he would not lose it for a thousand pounds. I layed my hand upon it soon afterwards, and gave it him. I believe I said, I was very glad to have met with it. O, then he did not know that it signified any thing. So you see, when the letter was lost it was worth a thousand pounds, and when it was found it was not worth a farthing.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The style and character of his conversation is pretty generally known; it was certainly conducted in conformity with a precept of Lord Bacon, but it is not clear, I apprehend, that this conformity was either perceived or intended by Johnson. The precept alluded to is as follows: &ldquo;In all kinds of speech, either pleasant, grave, severe, or ordinary, it is convenient to speak leisurely, and rather drawingly than hastily: because hasty speech confounds the memory, and oftentimes, besides the unseemliness, drives the man either to stammering, a non-plus, or harping on that which should follow; whereas a slow speech confirmeth the memory, addeth a conceit of wisdom to the hearers, besides a seemliness of speech and countenance.&rdquo; Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s method of conversation was certainly calculated to excite attention, and to amuse and instruct, (as it happened,) without wearying or confusing his company. He was always most perfectly clear and perspicuous; and his language was so accurate, and his sentences so neatly constructed, that his conversation might have been all printed without any correction. At the same time, it was easy and natural; the accuracy of it had no appearance of labour, constraint, or stiffness; he seemed more correct than others, by the force of habit, and the customary exercises of his powerful mind.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;He spoke often in praise of French literature. &ldquo;The French are excellent in this, (he would say,) they have a book on every subject.&rdquo; From what he had seen of them he denied them the praise of superiour politeness, and mentioned, with very visible disgust, the custom they have of spitting on the floors of their apartments. &ldquo;This, (said the Doctor) is as gross a thing as can well be done; and one wonders how any man, or set of men, can persist in so offensive a practice for a whole day together; one should expect that the first effort towards civilization would remove it even among savages.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Baxter&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Reasons of the Christian Religion</span>, he thought contained the best collection of the evidences of the divinity of the Christian system.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Chymistry was always an interesting pursuit with Dr. Johnson. Whilst he was in Wiltshire, he attended some experiments that were made by a physician at Salisbury, on the new kinds of air. In the course of the experiments frequent mention being made of Dr. Priestley, Dr. Johnson knit his brows, and in a stern manner enquired, &ldquo;Why do we hear so much of Dr. Priestley?&rdquo; He was very properly answered, &ldquo;Sir, because we are indebted to him for these important discoveries.&rdquo; On this Dr. Johnson appeared well content; and replied, &ldquo;Well, well, I believe we are; and let every man have the honour he has merited.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;A friend was one day, about two years before his death, struck with some instance of Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s great candour. &ldquo;Well, Sir, (said he,) I will always say that you are a very candid man.&rdquo; &ldquo;Will you,&rdquo; (replied the Doctor,) I doubt then you will be very singular. But, indeed, Sir, (continued he,) I look upon myself to be a man very much misunderstood. I am not an uncandid, nor am I a severe man. I sometimes say more than I mean, in jest; and people are apt to believe me serious: however, I am more candid than I was when I was younger. As I know more of mankind I expect less of them, and am ready now to call a man a <span class="t8">good man</span>, upon easier terms than I was formerly.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On his return from Heale he wrote to Dr. Burney: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I came home on the 18th at noon to a very disconsolate house. You and I have lost our friends; but you have more friends at home. My domestick companion is taken from me. She is much missed, for her acquisitions were many, and her curiosity universal; so that she partook of every conversation. I am not well enough to go much out; and to sit, and eat, or fast alone, is very wearisome. I always mean to send my compliments to all the ladies.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">His fortitude and patience met with severe trials during this year. The stroke of the palsy has been related circumstantially; but he was also afflicted with the gout, and was besides troubled with a complaint which not only was attended with immediate inconvenience, but threatened him with a chirurgical operation, from which most men would shrink. The complaint was a <span class="t8">sarcocele</span>, which Johnson bore with uncommon firmness, and was not at all frightened while he looked forward to amputation. He was attended by Mr. Pott and Mr. Cruikshank. I have before me a letter of the 30th of July this year, to Mr. Cruikshank, in which he says, &lsquo;I am going to put myself into your hands;&rsquo; and another, accompanying a set of his <span class="t8">Lives of the Poets</span>, in which he says, &lsquo;I beg your acceptance of these volumes, as an acknowledgement of the great favours which you have bestowed on, Sir, your most obliged and most humble servant.&rsquo; I have in my possession several more letters from him to Mr. Cruikshank, and also to Dr. Mudge at Plymouth, which it would be improper to insert, as they are filled with unpleasing technical details. I shall, however, extract from his letters to Dr. Mudge such passages as shew either a felicity of expression, or the undaunted state of his mind.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;My conviction of your skill, and my belief of your friendship, determine me to intreat your opinion and advice.&rsquo;&mdash; &lsquo;In this state I with great earnestness desire you to tell me what is to be done. Excision is doubtless necessary to the cure, and I know not any means of palliation. The operation is doubtless painful; but is it dangerous? The pain I hope to endure with decency; but I am loth to put life into much hazard.&rsquo;&mdash; &lsquo;By representing the gout as an antagonist to the palsy, you have said enough to make it welcome. This is not strictly the first fit, but I hope it is as good as the first; for it is the second that ever confined me; and the first was ten years ago, much less fierce and fiery than this.&rsquo;&mdash; &lsquo;Write, dear Sir, what you can to inform or encourage me. The operation is not delayed by any fears or objections of mine.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">To BENNET LANGTON, ESQ. &lsquo;Dear Sir, You may very reasonably charge me with insensibility of your kindness, and that of Lady Rothes, since I have suffered so much time to pass without paying any acknowledgement. I now, at last, return my thanks; and why I did it not sooner I ought to tell you. I went into Wiltshire as soon as I well could, and was there much employed in palliating my own malady. Disease produces much selfishness. A man in pain is looking after ease; and lets most other things go as chance shall dispose of them. In the mean time I have lost a companion, to whom I have had recourse for domestick amusement for thirty years, and whose variety of knowledge never was exhausted; and now return to a habitation vacant and desolate. I carry about a very troublesome and dangerous complaint, which admits no cure but by the chirurgical knife. Let me have your prayers. I am, &amp;c.</p>
<p class="p24">SAM. JOHNSON. London, Sept. 29, 1783.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Happily the complaint abated without his being put to the torture of amputation. But we must surely admire the manly resolution which he discovered while it hung over him.</p>
<p class="p24">In a letter to the same gentleman he writes, &lsquo;The gout has within these four days come upon me with a violence which I never experienced before. It made me helpless as an infant.&rsquo; And in another, having mentioned Mrs. Williams, he says,&mdash; &lsquo;whose death following that of Levett, has now made my house a solitude. She left her little substance to a charity-school. She is, I hope, where there is neither darkness, nor want, nor sorrow.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I wrote to him, begging to know the state of his health, and mentioned that Baxter&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Anacreon</span>, &lsquo;which is in the library at Auchinleck, was, I find, collated by my father in 1727, with the MS. belonging to the University of Leyden, and he has made a number of Notes upon it. Would you advise me to publish a new edition of it?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">His answer was dated September 30: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;You should not make your letters such rarities, when you know, or might know, the uniform state of my health. It is very long since I heard from you; and that I have not answered is a very insufficient reason for the silence of a friend. Your <span class="t8">Anacreon</span> is a very uncommon book; neither London nor Cambridge can supply a copy of that edition. Whether it should be reprinted, you cannot do better than consult Lord Hailes. &mdash; Besides my constant and radical disease, I have been for these ten days much harassed with the gout; but that has now remitted. I hope GOD will yet grant me a little longer life, and make me less unfit to appear before him.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He this autumn received a visit from the celebrated Mrs. Siddons. He gives this account of it in one of his letters to Mrs. Thrale: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Mrs. Siddons, in her visit to me, behaved with great modesty and propriety, and left nothing behind her to be censured or despised. Neither praise nor money, the two powerful corrupters of mankind, seem to have depraved her. I shall be glad to see her again. Her brother Kemble calls on me, and pleases me very well. Mrs. Siddons and I talked of plays; and she told me her intention of exhibiting this winter the characters of Constance, Catharine, and Isabella, in Shakspeare.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Mr. Kemble has favoured me with the following minute of what passed at this visit: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;When Mrs. Siddons came into the room, there happened to be no chair ready for her, which he observing, said with a smile, &ldquo;Madam, you who so often occasion a want of seats to other people, will the more easily excuse the want of one yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Having placed himself by her, he with great good-humour entered upon a consideration of the English drama; and, among other inquiries, particularly asked her which of Shakspeare&rsquo;s characters she was most pleased with. Upon her answering that she thought the character of Queen Catharine, in <span class="t8">Henry the Eighth</span>, the most natural:&mdash; &ldquo;I think so too, Madam, (said he;) and whenever you perform it, I will once more hobble out to the theatre myself.&rdquo; Mrs. Siddons promised she would do herself the honour of acting his favourite part for him; but many circumstances happened to prevent the representation of <span class="t8">King Henry the Eighth</span> during the Doctor&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;In the course of the evening he thus gave his opinion upon the merits of some of the principal performers whom he remembered to have seen upon the stage. &ldquo;Mrs. Porter, in the vehemence of rage, and Mrs. Clive in the sprightliness of humour, I have never seen equalled. What Clive did best, she did better than Garrick; but could not do half so many things well; she was a better romp than any I ever saw in nature. Pritchard, in common life, was a vulgar ideot; she would talk of her <span class="t8">gownd</span>: but, when she appeared upon the stage, seemed to be inspired by gentility and understanding. I once talked with Colley Cibber, and thought him ignorant of the principles of his art. Garrick, Madam, was no declaimer; there was not one of his own scene-shifters who could not have spoken <span class="t8">To be, or not to be</span>, better than he did; yet he was the only actor I ever saw, whom I could call a master both in tragedy and comedy; though I liked him best in comedy. A true conception of character, and natural expression of it, were his distinguished excellencies.&rdquo; Having expatiated, with his usual force and eloquence, on Mr. Garrick&rsquo;s extraordinary eminence as an actor, he concluded with this compliment to his social talents: &ldquo;And after all, Madam, I thought him less to be envied on the stage than at the head of a table.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson, indeed, had thought more upon the subject of acting than might be generally supposed. Talking of it one day to Mr. Kemble, he said, &lsquo;Are you, Sir, one of those enthusiasts who believe yourself transformed into the very character you represent?&rsquo; Upon Mr. Kemble&rsquo;s answering that he had never felt so strong a persuasion himself; &lsquo;To be sure not, Sir, (said Johnson;) the thing is impossible. And if Garrick really believed himself to be that monster, Richard the Third, he deserved to be hanged every time he performed it.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">A pleasing instance of the generous attention of one of his friends has been discovered by the publication of Mrs. Thrale&rsquo;s collection of <span class="t8">Letters</span>. In a letter to one of the Miss Thrales, he writes, &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;A friend, whose name I will tell when your mamma has tried to guess it, sent to my physician to enquire whether this long train of illness had brought me into difficulties for want of money, with an invitation to send to him for what occasion required. I shall write this night to thank him, having no need to borrow.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">And afterwards, in a letter to Mrs. Thrale, &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Since you cannot guess, I will tell you, that the generous man was Gerard Hamilton. I returned him a very thankful and respectful letter.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I applied to Mr. Hamilton, by a common friend, and he has been so obliging as to let me have Johnson&rsquo;s letter to him upon this occasion, to adorn my collection.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To THE RIGHT HONOURABLE WILLIAM GERARD HAMILTON.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your kind enquiries after my affairs, and your generous offers, have been communicated to me by Dr. Brocklesby. I return thanks with great sincerity, having lived long enough to know what gratitude is due to such friendship; and entreat that my refusal may not be imputed to sullenness or pride. I am, indeed, in no want. Sickness is, by the generosity of my physicians, of little expence to me. But if any unexpected exigence should press me, you shall see, dear Sir, how cheerfully I can be obliged to so much liberality.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;I am, Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your most obedient</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And most humble servant,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;November, 19, 1783.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I find in this, as in former years, notices of his kind attention to Mrs. Gardiner, who, though in the humble station of a tallow-chandler upon Snow-hill, was a woman of excellent good sense, pious, and charitable. She told me, she had been introduced to him by Mrs. Masters, the poetess, whose volumes he revised, and, it is said, illuminated here and there with a ray of his own genius. Mrs. Gardiner was very zealous for the support of the Ladies&rsquo; charity-school, in the parish of St. Sepulchre. It is confined to females; and, I am told, it afforded a hint for the story of <span class="t8">Betty Broom</span> in <span class="t8">The Idler</span>. Johnson this year, I find, obtained for it a sermon from the late Bishop of St. Asaph, Dr. Shipley, whom he, in one of his letters to Mrs. Thrale, characterises as &lsquo;knowing and conversible;&rsquo; and whom all who knew his Lordship, even those who differed from him in politicks, remember with much respect.</p>
<p class="p24">The Earl of Carlisle having written a tragedy, entitled <span class="t8">The Fathers Revenge</span>, some of his Lordship&rsquo;s friends applied to Mrs. Chapone to prevail on Dr. Johnson to read and give his opinion of it, which he accordingly did, in a letter to that lady. Sir Joshua Reynolds having informed me that this letter was in Lord Carlisle&rsquo;s possession, though I was not fortunate enough to have the honour of being known to his Lordship, trusting to the general courtesy of literature, I wrote to him, requesting the favour of a copy of it, and to be permitted to insert it in my <span class="t8">Life of Dr. Johnson</span>. His Lordship was so good as to comply with my request, and has thus enabled me to enrich my work with a very fine piece of writing, which displays both the critical skill and politeness of my illustrious friend; and perhaps the curiosity which it will excite, may induce the noble and elegant Authour to gratify the world by the publication of a performance, of which Dr. Johnson has spoken in such terms.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To MRS. CHAPONE.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;MADAM,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;By sending the tragedy to me a second time, I think that a very honourable distinction has been shewn me, and I did not delay the perusal, of which I am now to tell the effect.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The construction of the play is not completely regular; the stage is too often vacant, and the scenes are not sufficiently connected. This, however, would be called by Dryden only a mechanical defect; which takes away little from the power of the poem, and which is seen rather than felt.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;A rigid examiner of the diction might, perhaps, wish some words changed, and some lines more vigorously terminated. But from such petty imperfections what writer was ever free?</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The general form and force of the dialogue is of more importance. It seems to want that quickness of reciprocation which characterises the English drama, and is not always sufficiently fervid or animated.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Of the sentiments I remember not one that I wished omitted. In the imagery I cannot forbear to distinguish the comparison of joy succeeding grief to light rushing on the eye accustomed to darkness. It seems to have all that can be desired to make it please. It is new, just, and delightful.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;With the characters, either as conceived or preserved, I have no fault to find; but was much inclined to congratulate a writer, who, in defiance of prejudice and fashion, made the Archbishop a good man, and scorned all thoughtless applause, which a vicious churchman would have brought him.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The catastrophe is affecting. The Father and Daughter both culpable, both wretched, and both penitent, divide between them our pity and our sorrow.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Thus, Madam, I have performed what I did not willingly undertake, and could not decently refuse. The noble writer will be pleased to remember, that sincere criticism ought to raise no resentment, because judgement is not under the controul of will; but involuntary criticism, as it has still less of choice, ought to be more remote from possibility of offence.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am, &amp;c.,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;November 28, 1783.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I consulted him on two questions of a very different nature: one, whether the unconstitutional influence exercised by the Peers of Scotland in the election of the representatives of the Commons, by means of fictitious qualifications, ought not to be resisted; &mdash; the other, What, in propriety and humanity, should be done with old horses unable to labour. I gave him some account of my life at Auchinleck: and expressed my satisfaction that the gentlemen of the county had, at two publick meetings, elected me their <span class="t8">Praeses</span> or Chairman.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To JAMES BOSWELL, ESQ.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Like all other men who have great friends, you begin to feel the pangs of neglected merit; and all the comfort that I can give you is, by telling you that you have probably more pangs to feel, and more neglect to suffer. You have, indeed, begun to complain too soon; and I hope I am the only confidant of your discontent. Your friends have not yet had leisure to gratify personal kindness; they have hitherto been busy in strengthening their ministerial interest. If a vacancy happens in Scotland, give them early intelligence; and as you can serve Government as powerfully as any of your probable competitors, you may make in some sort a warrantable claim.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Of the exaltations and depressions of your mind you delight to talk, and I hate to hear. Drive all such fancies from you.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;On the day when I received your letter, I think, the foregoing page was written; to which, one disease or another has hindered me from making any additions. I am now a little better. But sickness and solitude press me very heavily. I could bear sickness better, if I were relieved from solitude.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The present dreadful confusion of the publick ought to make you wrap yourself up in your hereditary possessions, which, though less than you may wish, are more than you can want; and in an hour of religious retirement return thanks to GOD, who has exempted you from any strong temptation to faction, treachery, plunder, and disloyalty.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;As your neighbours distinguish you by such honours as they can bestow, content yourself with your station, without neglecting your profession. Your estate and the Courts will find you full employment; and your mind, well occupied, will be quiet.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The usurpation of the nobility, for they apparently usurp all the influence they gain by fraud and misrepresentation, I think it certainly lawful, perhaps your duty, to resist. What is not their own they have only by robbery.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your question about the horses gives me more perplexity. I know not well what advice to give you. I can only recommend a rule which you do not want; &mdash; give as little pain as you can. I suppose that we have a right to their service while their strength lasts; what we can do with them afterwards I cannot so easily determine. But let us consider. Nobody denies that man has a right first to milk the cow, and to sheer the sheep, and then to kill them for his table. May he not, by parity of reason, first work a horse, and then kill him the easiest way, that he may have the means of another horse, or food for cows and sheep? Man is influenced in both cases by different motives of self-interest. He that rejects the one must reject the other.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am, &amp;c.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;London, Dec. 24, 1783.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;A happy and pious Christmas; and many happy years to you, your lady, and children.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">The late ingenious Mr. Mickle, some time before his death, wrote me a letter concerning Dr. Johnson, in which he mentions, &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I was upwards of twelve years acquainted with him, was frequently in his company, always talked with ease to him, and can truly say, that I never received from him one rough word.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">In this letter he relates his having, while engaged in translating the <span class="t8">Lusiad</span>, had a dispute of considerable length with Johnson, who, as usual, declaimed upon the misery and corruption of a sea life, and used this expression:&mdash; &lsquo;It had been happy for the world, Sir, if your hero Gama, Prince Henry of Portugal, and Columbus, had never been born, or that their schemes had never gone farther than their own imaginations.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;This sentiment, (says Mr. Mickle,) which is to be found in his <span class="t8">Introduction to the World displayed</span>, I, in my Dissertation prefixed to the <span class="t8">Lusiad</span>, have controverted; and though authours are said to be bad judges of their own works, I am not ashamed to own to a friend, that that dissertation is my favourite above all that I ever attempted in prose. Next year, when the Lusiad was published, I waited on Dr. Johnson, who addressed me with one of his good-humoured smiles:&mdash; &ldquo;Well, you have remembered our dispute about Prince Henry, and have cited me too. You have done your part very well indeed: you have made the best of your argument; but I am not convinced yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Before publishing the <span class="t8">Lusiad</span>, I sent Mr. Hoole a proof of that part of the introduction, in which I make mention of Dr. Johnson, yourself, and other well-wishers to the work, begging it might be shewn to Dr. Johnson. This was accordingly done; and in place of the simple mention of him which I had made, he dictated to Mr. Hoole the sentence as it now stands.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Dr. Johnson told me in 1772, that, about twenty years before that time, he himself had a design to translate the <span class="t8">Lusiad</span>, of the merit of which he spoke highly, but had been prevented by a number of other engagements.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Mr. Mickle reminds me in this letter of a conversation, at dinner one day at Mr. Hoole&rsquo;s with Dr. Johnson, when Mr. Nicol the King&rsquo;s bookseller and I attempted to controvert the maxim, &lsquo;better that ten guilty should escape, than one innocent person suffer;&rsquo; and were answered by Dr. Johnson with great power of reasoning and eloquence. I am very sorry that I have no record of that day: but I well recollect my illustrious friend&rsquo;s having ably shewn, that unless civil institutions insure protection to the innocent, all the confidence which mankind should have in them would be lost.</p>
<p class="p24">I shall here mention what, in strict chronological arrangement, should have appeared in my account of last year; but may more properly be introduced here, the controversy having not been closed till this. The Reverend Mr. Shaw, a native of one of the Hebrides, having entertained doubts of the authenticity of the poems ascribed to Ossian, divested himself of national bigotry; and having travelled in the Highlands and Islands of Scotland, and also in Ireland, in order to furnish himself with materials for a <span class="t8">Gaelick Dictionary</span>, which he afterwards compiled, was so fully satisfied that Dr. Johnson was in the right upon the question, that he candidly published a pamphlet, stating his conviction and the proofs and reasons on which it was founded. A person at Edinburgh, of the name of Clark, answered this pamphlet with much zeal, and much abuse of its authour. Johnson took Mr. Shaw under his protection, and gave him his assistance in writing a reply, which has been admired by the best judges, and by many been considered as conclusive. A few paragraphs, which sufficiently mark their great Authour, shall be selected: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;My assertions are, for the most part, purely negative: I deny the existence of Fingal, because in a long and curious peregrination through the Gaelick regions I have never been able to find it. What I could not see myself I suspect to be equally invisible to others; and I suspect with the more reason, as among all those who have seen it no man can shew it.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Mr. Clark compares the obstinacy of those who disbelieve the genuineness of Ossian to a blind man, who should dispute the reality of colours, and deny that the British troops are cloathed in red. The blind man&rsquo;s doubt would be rational, if he did not know by experience that others have a power which he himself wants: but what perspicacity has Mr. Clark which Nature has withheld from me or the rest of mankind?</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The true state of the parallel must be this. Suppose a man, with eyes like his neighbours, was told by a boasting corporal, that the troops, indeed, wore red clothes for their ordinary dress, but that every soldier had likewise a suit of black velvet, which he put on when the King reviews them. This he thinks strange, and desires to see the fine clothes, but finds nobody in forty thousand men that can produce either coat or waistcoat. One, indeed, has left them in his chest at Port Mahon; another has always heard that he ought to have velvet clothes somewhere; and a third has heard somebody say, that soldiers ought to wear velvet. Can the enquirer be blamed if he goes away believing that a soldier&rsquo;s red coat is all that he has?</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;But the most obdurate incredulity may be shamed or silenced by acts. To overpower contradictions, let the soldier shew his velvet-coat, and the Fingalist the original of Ossian.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The difference between us and the blind man is this: &mdash; the blind man is unconvinced, because he cannot see; and we, because though we can see, we find that nothing can be shown.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Notwithstanding the complication of disorders under which Johnson now laboured, he did not resign himself to despondency and discontent, but with wisdom and spirit endeavoured to console and amuse his mind with as many innocent enjoyments as he could procure. Sir John Hawkins has mentioned the cordiality with which he insisted that such of the members of the old club in Ivy-lane as survived, should meet again and dine together, which they did, twice at a tavern and once at his house: and in order to insure himself society in the evening for three days in the week, he instituted a club at the Essex Head, in Essex-street, then kept by Samuel Greaves, an old servant of Mr. Thrale&rsquo;s.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To SIR JOSHUA REYNOLDS.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;It is inconvenient to me to come out, I should else have waited on you with an account of a little evening Club which we are establishing in Essex-street, in the Strand, and of which you are desired to be one. It will be held at the Essex Head, now kept by an old servant of Thrale&rsquo;s. The company is numerous, and, as you will see by the list, miscellaneous. The terms are lax, and the expences light. Mr. Barry was adopted by Dr. Brocklesby, who joined with me in forming the plan. We meet thrice a week, and he who misses forfeits two-pence.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;If you are willing to become a member, draw a line under your name. Return the list. We meet for the first time on Monday at eight.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;I am, &amp;c.</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Dec. 4, 1783.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">It did not suit Sir Joshua to be one of this Club. But when I mention only Mr. Daines Barrington, Dr. Brocklesby, Mr. Murphy, Mr. John Nichols, Mr. Cooke, Mr. Joddrel, Mr. Paradise, Dr. Horsley, Mr. Windham, I shall sufficiently obviate the misrepresentation of it by Sir John Hawkins, as if it had been a low ale-house association, by which Johnson was degraded. Johnson himself, like his namesake Old Ben, composed the Rules of his Club.</p>
<p class="p24">In the end of this year he was seized with a spasmodick asthma of such violence, that he was confined to the house in great pain, being sometimes obliged to sit all night in his chair, a recumbent posture being so hurtful to his respiration, that he could not endure lying in bed; and there came upon him at the same time that oppressive and fatal disease, a dropsy. It was a very severe winter, which probably aggravated his complaints; and the solitude in which Mr. Levett and Mrs. Williams had left him, rendered his life very gloomy. Mrs. Desmoulins, who still lived, was herself so very ill, that she could contribute very little to his relief. He, however, had none of that unsocial shyness which we commonly see in people afflicted with sickness. He did not hide his head from the world, in solitary abstraction; he did not deny himself to the visits of his friends and acquaintances; but at all times, when he was not overcome by sleep, was ready for conversation as in his best days.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To MRS. LUCY PORTER, IN LICHFIELD.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;DEAR MADAM,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;You may perhaps think me negligent that I have not written to you again upon the loss of your brother; but condolences and consolations are such common and such useless things, that the omission of them is no great crime: and my own diseases occupy my mind, and engage my care. My nights are miserably restless, and my days, therefore, are heavy. I try, however, to hold up my head as high as I can.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am sorry that your health is impaired; perhaps the spring and the summer may, in some degree, restore it: but if not, we must submit to the inconveniences of time, as to the other dispensations of Eternal Goodness. Pray for me, and write to me, or let Mr. Pearson write for you.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am, &amp;c.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;London, Nov. 29, 1783.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">1784: Aetat. 75. &mdash; And now I am arrived at the last year of the life of SAMUEL JOHNSON, a year in which, although passed in severe indisposition, he nevertheless gave many evidences of the continuance of those wondrous powers of mind, which raised him so high in the intellectual world. His conversation and his letters of this year were in no respect inferiour to those of former years.</p>
<p class="p24">The following is a remarkable proof of his being alive to the most minute curiosities of literature.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To MR. DILLY, BOOKSELLER, IN THE POULTRY.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;There is in the world a set of books which used to be sold by the booksellers on the bridge, and which I must entreat you to procure me. They are called <span class="t8">Burton&rsquo;s Books</span>; the title of one is <span class="t8">Admirable Curiosities, Rarities, and Wonders in England</span>. I believe there are about five or six of them; they seem very proper to allure backward readers; be so kind as to get them for me, and send me them with the best printed edition of <span class="t8">Baxter&rsquo;s Call to the Unconverted</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am, &amp;c.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Jan. 6, 1784.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To MR. PERKINS.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I was very sorry not to see you when you were so kind as to call on me; but to disappoint friends, and if they are not very good natured, to disoblige them, is one of the evils of sickness. If you will please to let me know which of the afternoons in this week I shall be favoured with another visit by you and Mrs. Perkins, and the young people, I will take all the measures that I can to be pretty well at that time.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am, dear Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your most humble servant,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Jan. 21, 1784.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">His attention to the Essex-Head Club appears from the following letter to Mr. Alderman Clark, a gentleman for whom he deservedly entertained a great regard.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To RICHARD CLARK, ESQ.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;You will receive a requisition, according to the rules of the Club, to be at the house as President of the night. This turn comes once a month, and the member is obliged to attend, or send another in his place. You were enrolled in the Club by my invitation, and I ought to introduce you; but as I am hindered by sickness, Mr. Hoole will very properly supply my place as introductor, or yours as President. I hope in milder weather to be a very constant attendant.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am, Sir, &amp;c.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Jan. 27, 1784.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;You ought to be informed that the forfeits began with the year, and that every night of non-attendance incurs the mulct of three-pence, that is, nine pence a week.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On the 8th of January I wrote to him, anxiously inquiring as to his health, and enclosing my <span class="t8">Letter to the People of Scotland, on the present state of the nation</span>.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I trust, (said I,) that you will be liberal enough to make allowance for my differing from you on two points, (the Middlesex Election, and the American War) when my general principles of government are according to your own heart, and when, at a crisis of doubtful event, I stand forth with honest zeal as an ancient and faithful Briton. My reason for introducing those two points was, that as my opinions with regard to them had been declared at the periods when they were least favourable, I might have the credit of a man who is not a worshipper of ministerial power.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To JAMES BOSWELL, ESQ.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I hear of many enquiries which your kindness has disposed you to make after me. I have long intended you a long letter, which perhaps the imagination of its length hindered me from beginning. I will, therefore, content myself with a shorter.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Having promoted the institution of a new Club in the neighbourhood, at the house of an old servant of Thrale&rsquo;s, I went thither to meet the company, and was seized with a spasmodick asthma so violent, that with difficulty I got to my own house, in which I have been confined eight or nine weeks, and from which I know not when I shall be able to go even to church. The asthma, however, is not the worst. A dropsy gains ground upon me; my legs and thighs are very much swollen with water, which I should be content if I could keep there, but I am afraid that it will soon be higher. My nights are very sleepless and very tedious. And yet I am extremely afraid of dying.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;My physicians try to make me hope, that much of my malady is the effect of cold, and that some degree at least of recovery is to be expected from vernal breezes and summer suns. If my life is prolonged to autumn, I should be glad to try a warmer climate; though how to travel with a diseased body, without a companion to conduct me, and with very little money, I do not well see. Ramsay has recovered his limbs in Italy; and Fielding was sent to Lisbon, where, indeed, he died; but he was, I believe, past hope when he went. Think for me what I can do.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I received your pamphlet, and when I write again may perhaps tell you some opinion about it; but you will forgive a man struggling with disease his neglect of disputes, politicks, and pamphlets. Let me have your prayers. My compliments to your lady, and young ones. Ask your physicians about my case: and desire Sir Alexander Dick to write me his opinion.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am, dear Sir, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="p24">&lsquo;Feb. 11, 1784.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;TO MRS. LUCY PORTER, IN LICHFIELD.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;MY DEAREST LOVE,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I have been extremely ill of an asthma and dropsy, but received, by the mercy of GOD, sudden and unexpected relief last Thursday, by the discharge of twenty pints of water. Whether I shall continue free, or shall fill again, cannot be told. Pray for me.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Death, my dear, is very dreadful; let us think nothing worth our care but how to prepare for it: what we know amiss in ourselves let us make haste to amend, and put our trust in the mercy of GOD, and the intercession of our Saviour. I am, dear Madam,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your most humble servant,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Feb. 23, 1784.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">TO JAMES BOSWELL, ESQ.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I have just advanced so far towards recovery as to read a pamphlet; and you may reasonably suppose that the first pamphlet which I read was yours. I am very much of your opinion, and, like you, feel great indignation at the indecency with which the King is every day treated. Your paper contains very considerable knowledge of history and of the constitution, very properly produced and applied. It will certainly raise your character, though perhaps it may not make you a Minister of State.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I desire you to see Mrs. Stewart once again, and tell her, that in the letter-case was a letter relating to me, for which I will give her, if she is willing to give it me, another guinea. The letter is of consequence only to me.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am, dear Sir, &amp;c. &lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo; &lsquo;London, Feb. 27, 1784.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">In consequence of Johnson&rsquo;s request that I should ask our physicians about his case, and desire Sir Alexander Dick to send his opinion, I transmitted him a letter from that very amiable Baronet, then in his eighty-first year, with his faculties as entire as ever; and mentioned his expressions to me in the note accompanying it: &lsquo;With my most affectionate wishes for Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s recovery, in which his friends, his country, and all mankind have so deep a stake:&rsquo; and at the same time a full opinion upon his case by Dr. Gillespie, who, like Dr. Cullen, had the advantage of having passed through the gradations of surgery and pharmacy, and by study and practice had attained to such skill, that my father settled on him two hundred pounds a year for five years, and fifty pounds a year during his life, as an <span class="t8">honorarium</span> to secure his particular attendance. The opinion was conveyed in a letter to me, beginning, &lsquo;I am sincerely sorry for the bad state of health your very learned and illustrious friend, Dr. Johnson, labours under at present.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;TO JAMES BOSWELL, ESQ. &lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Presently after I had sent away my last letter, I received your kind medical packet. I am very much obliged both to you and your physicians for your kind attention to my disease. Dr. Gillespie has sent me an excellent <span class="t8">consilium medicum</span>, all solid practical experimental knowledge. I am at present, in the opinion of my physicians, (Dr. Heberden and Dr. Brocklesby,) as well as my own, going on very hopefully. I have just begun to take vinegar of squills. The powder hurt my stomach so much, that it could not be continued.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Return Sir Alexander Dick my sincere thanks for his kind letter; and bring with you the rhubarb which he so tenderly offers me.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I hope dear Mrs. Boswell is now quite well, and that no evil, either real or imaginary, now disturbs you.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am, &amp;c.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;London, March 2, 1784.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I also applied to three of the eminent physicians who had chairs in our celebrated school of medicine at Edinburgh, Doctors Cullen, Hope, and Monro, to each of whom I sent the following letter: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Dr. Johnson has been very ill for some time; and in a letter of anxious apprehension he writes to me, &ldquo;Ask your physicians about my case.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;This, you see, is not authority for a regular consultation: but I have no doubt of your readiness to give your advice to a man so eminent, and who, in his <span class="t8">Life of Garth</span>, has paid your profession a just and elegant compliment: &ldquo;I believe every man has found in physicians great liberality and dignity of sentiment, very prompt effusions of beneficence, and willingness to exert a lucrative art, where there is no hope of lucre.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Dr. Johnson is aged seventy-four. Last summer he had a stroke of the palsy, from which he recovered almost entirely. He had, before that, been troubled with a catarrhous cough. This winter he was seized with a spasmodick asthma, by which he has been confined to his house for about three months. Dr. Brocklesby writes to me, that upon the least admission of cold, there is such a constriction upon his breast, that he cannot lie down in his bed, but is obliged to sit up all night, and gets rest and sometimes sleep, only by means of laudanum and syrup of poppies; and that there are oedematous tumours on his legs and thighs. Dr. Brocklesby trusts a good deal to the return of mild weather. Dr. Johnson says, that a dropsy gains ground upon him; and he seems to think that a warmer climate would do him good. I understand he is now rather better, and is using vinegar of squills. I am, with great esteem, dear Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your most obedient humble servant,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;JAMES BOSWELL.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;March 7, 1784.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">All of them paid the most polite attention to my letter, and its venerable object. Dr. Cullen&rsquo;s words concerning him were, &lsquo;It would give me the greatest pleasure to be of any service to a man whom the publick properly esteem, and whom I esteem and respect as much as I do Dr. Johnson.&rsquo; Dr. Hope&rsquo;s, &lsquo;Few people have a better claim on me than your friend, as hardly a day passes that I do not ask his opinion about this or that word.&rsquo; Dr. Monro&rsquo;s, &lsquo;I most sincerely join you in sympathizing with that very worthy and ingenious character, from whom his country has derived much instruction and entertainment.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Dr. Hope corresponded with his friend Dr. Brocklesby. Doctors Cullen and Monro wrote their opinions and prescriptions to me, which I afterwards carried with me to London, and, so far as they were encouraging, communicated to Johnson. The liberality on one hand, and grateful sense of it on the other, I have great satisfaction in recording.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;TO JAMES BOSWELL, ESQ.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am too much pleased with the attention which you and your dear lady show to my welfare, not to be diligent in letting you know the progress which I make towards health. The dropsy, by GOD&rsquo;S blessing, has now run almost totally away by natural evacuation; and the asthma, if not irritated by cold, gives me little trouble. While I am writing this, I have not any sensation of debility or disease. But I do not yet venture out, having been confined to the house from the thirteenth of December, now a quarter of a year.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;When it will be fit for me to travel as far as Auchinleck, I am not able to guess; but such a letter as Mrs. Boswell&rsquo;s might draw any man, not wholly motionless, a great way. Pray tell the dear lady how much her civility and kindness have touched and gratified me.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Our parliamentary tumults have now begun to subside, and the King&rsquo;s authority is in some measure re-established. Mr. Pitt will have great power: but you must remember, that what he has to give must, at least for some time, be given to those who gave, and those who preserve, his power. A new minister can sacrifice little to esteem or friendship; he must, till he is settled, think only of extending his interest.</p>
<p class="p20">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;If you come hither through Edinburgh, send for Mrs. Stewart, and give from me another guinea for the letter in the old case, to which I shall not be satisfied with my claim, till she gives it me.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Please to bring with you Baxter&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Anacreon</span>; and if you procure heads of <span class="t8">Hector Boece</span>, the historian, and <span class="t8">Arthur Johnston</span>, the poet, I will put them in my room; or any other of the fathers of Scottish literature.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I wish you an easy and happy journey, and hope I need not tell you that you will be welcome to, dear Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your most affectionate, humble servant,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;London, March 18, 1784.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I wrote to him, March 28, from York, informing him that I had a high gratification in the triumph of monarchical principles over aristocratical influence, in that great country, in an address to the King; that I was thus far on my way to him, but that news of the dissolution of Parliament having arrived, I was to hasten back to my own county, where I had carried an Address to his Majesty by a great majority, and had some intention of being a candidate to represent the county in Parliament.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To JAMES BOSWELL, ESQ.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;You could do nothing so proper as to haste back when you found the Parliament dissolved. With the influence which your Address must have gained you, it may reasonably be expected that your presence will be of importance, and your activity of effect.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your solicitude for me gives me that pleasure which every man feels from the kindness of such a friend: and it is with delight I relieve it by telling, that Dr. Brocklesby&rsquo;s account is true, and that I am, by the blessing of GOD, wonderfully relieved.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;You are entering upon a transaction which requires much prudence. You must endeavour to oppose without exasperating; to practise temporary hostility, without producing enemies for life. This is, perhaps, hard to be done; yet it has been done by many, and seems most likely to be effected by opposing merely upon general principles, without descending to personal or particular censures or objections. One thing I must enjoin you, which is seldom observed in the conduct of elections; &mdash; I must entreat you to be scrupulous in the use of strong liquors. One night&rsquo;s drunkenness may defeat the labours of forty days well employed. Be firm, but not clamorous; be active, but not malicious; and you may form such an interest, as may not only exalt yourself, but dignify your family.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;We are, as you may suppose, all busy here. Mr. Fox resolutely stands for Westminster, and his friends say will carry the election. However that be, he will certainly have a seat. Mr. Hoole has just told me, that the city leans towards the King.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Let me hear, from time to time, how you are employed, and what progress you make.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Make dear Mrs. Boswell, and all the young Boswells, the sincere compliments of, Sir, your affectionate humble servant,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;London, March 30, 1784.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">To Mr. Langton he wrote with that cordiality which was suitable to the long friendship which had subsisted between him and that gentleman.</p>
<p class="p24">March 27. &lsquo;Since you left me, I have continued in my own opinion, and in Dr, Brocklesby&rsquo;s, to grow better with respect to all my formidable and dangerous distempers: though to a body battered and shaken as mine has lately been, it is to be feared that weak attacks may be sometimes mischievous. I have, indeed, by standing carelessly at an open window, got a very troublesome cough, which it has been necessary to appease by opium, in larger quantities than I like to take, and I have not found it give way so readily as I expected; its obstinacy, however, seems at last disposed to submit to the remedy, and I know not whether I should then have a right to complain of any morbid sensation. My asthma is, I am afraid, constitutional and incurable; but it is only occasional, and unless it be excited by labour or by cold, gives me no molestation, nor does it lay very close siege to life; for Sir John Floyer, whom the physical race consider as authour of one of the best books upon it, panted on to ninety, as was supposed; and why were we content with supposing a fact so interesting, of a man so conspicuous? because he corrupted, at perhaps seventy or eighty, the register, that he might pass for younger than he was. He was not much less than eighty, when to a man of rank who modestly asked his age, he answered, &ldquo;Go look;&rdquo; though he was in general a man of civility and elegance.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The ladies, I find, are at your house all well, except Miss Langton, who will probably soon recover her health by light suppers. Let her eat at dinner as she will, but not take a full stomach to bed. Pay my sincere respects to dear Miss Langton in Lincolnshire, let her know that I mean not to break our league of friendship, and that I have a set of <span class="t8">Lives</span> for her, when I have the means of sending it.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">April 8. &lsquo;I am still disturbed by my cough; but what thanks have I not to pay, when my cough is the most painful sensation that I feel? and from that I expect hardly to be released, while winter continues to gripe us with so much pertinacity. The year has now advanced eighteen days beyond the equinox, and still there is very little remission of the cold. When warm weather comes, which surely must come at last, I hope it will help both me and your young lady.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The man so busy about addresses is neither more nor less than our own Boswell, who had come as far as York towards London, but turned back on the dissolution, and is said now to stand for some place. Whether to wish him success, his best friends hesitate.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Let me have your prayers for the completion of my recovery: I am now better than I ever expected to have been. May GOD add to his mercies the grace that may enable me to use them according to his will. My compliments to all.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">April 13. &lsquo;I had this evening a note from Lord Portmore, desiring that I would give you an account of my health. You might have had it with less circumduction. I am, by GOD&rsquo;S blessing, I believe, free from all morbid sensations, except a cough, which is only troublesome. But I am still weak, and can have no great hope of strength till the weather shall be softer. The summer, if it be kindly, will, I hope, enable me to support the winter. GOD, who has so wonderfully restored me, can preserve me in all seasons.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Let me enquire in my turn after the state of your family, great and little. I hope Lady Rothes and Miss Langton are both well. That is a good basis of content. Then how goes George on with his studies? How does Miss Mary? And how does my own Jenny? I think I owe Jenny a letter, which I will take care to pay. In the mean time tell her that I acknowledge the debt.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Be pleased to make my compliments to the ladies. If Mrs. Langton comes to London, she will favour me with a visit, for I am not well enough to go out.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To OZIAS HUMPHRY, ESQ.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Mr. Hoole has told me with what benevolence you listened to a request which I was almost afraid to make, of leave to a young painter to attend you from time to time in your painting-room, to see your operations, and receive your instructions.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The young man has perhaps good parts, but has been without a regular education. He is my god-son, and therefore I interest myself in his progress and success, and shall think myself much favoured if I receive from you a permission to send him.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;My health is, by GOD&rsquo;S blessing, much restored, but I am not yet allowed by my physicians to go abroad; nor, indeed, do I think myself yet able to endure the weather.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am, Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your most humble servant,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;April 5, 1784.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">To THE SAME.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;The bearer is my god-son, whom I take the liberty of recommending to your kindness; which I hope he will deserve by his respect to your excellence, and his gratitude for your favours.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am, Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your most humble servant,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;April 10, 1784.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">To THE SAME.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am very much obliged by your civilities to my god-son, but must beg of you to add to them the favour of permitting him to see you paint, that he may know how a picture is begun, advanced and completed.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;If he may attend you in a few of your operations, I hope he will shew that the benefit has been properly conferred, both by his proficiency and his gratitude. At least I shall consider you as enlarging your kindness to, Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your humble servant,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;May 31, 1784.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To THE REVEREND DR. TAYLOR, ASHBOURNE, DERBYSHIRE.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;What can be the reason that I hear nothing from you? I hope nothing disables you from writing. What I have seen, and what I have felt, gives me reason to fear every thing. Do not omit giving me the comfort of knowing, that after all my losses I have yet a friend left.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I want every comfort. My life is very solitary and very cheerless. Though it has pleased GOD wonderfully to deliver me from the dropsy, I am yet very weak, and have not passed the door since the 13th of December. I hope for some help from warm weather, which will surely come in time.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I could not have the consent of the physicians to go to church yesterday; I therefore received the holy sacrament at home, in the room where I communicated with dear Mrs. Williams, a little before her death. O! my friend, the approach of death is very dreadful. I am afraid to think on that which I know I cannot avoid. It is vain to look round and round for that help which cannot be had. Yet we hope and hope, and fancy that he who has lived to-day may live to-morrow. But let us learn to derive our hope only from GOD.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;In the mean time, let us be kind to one another. I have no friend now living but you and Mr. Hector, that was the friend of my youth. Do not neglect, dear Sir,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Yours affectionately,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;London, Easter-Monday,</p>
<p class="p24">April 12, 1784.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">What follows is a beautiful specimen of his gentleness and complacency to a young lady his god-child, one of the daughters of his friend Mr. Langton, then I think in her seventh year. He took the trouble to write it in a large round hand, nearly resembling printed characters, that she might have the satisfaction of reading it herself. The original lies before me, but shall be faithfully restored to her; and I dare say will be preserved by her as a jewel as long as she lives.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;To Miss JANE LANGTON, IN ROCHESTER, KENT.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;MY DEAREST MISS JENNY,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am sorry that your pretty letter has been so long without being answered; but, when I am not pretty well, I do not always write plain enough for young ladies. I am glad, my dear, to see that you write so well, and hope that you mind your pen, your book, and your needle, for they are all necessary. Your books will give you knowledge, and make you respected; and your needle will find you useful employment when you do not care to read. When you are a little older, I hope you will be very diligent in learning arithmetick, and, above all, that through your whole life you will carefully say your prayers, and read your Bible.</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;I am, my dear,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Your most humble servant,</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;SAM. JOHNSON.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;May 10, 1784.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Wednesday, May 5, I arrived in London, and next morning had the pleasure to find Dr. Johnson greatly recovered. I but just saw him; for a coach was waiting to carry him to Islington, to the house of his friend the Reverend Mr. Strahan, where he went sometimes for the benefit of good air, which, notwithstanding his having formerly laughed at the general opinion upon the subject, he now acknowledged was conducive to health.</p>
<p class="p24">One morning afterwards, when I found him alone, he communicated to me, with solemn earnestness, a very remarkable circumstance which had happened in the course of his illness, when he was much distressed by the dropsy. He had shut himself up, and employed a day in particular exercises of religion, &mdash; fasting, humiliation, and prayer. On a sudden he obtained extraordinary relief, for which he looked up to Heaven with grateful devotion. He made no direct inference from this fact; but from his manner of telling it, I could perceive that it appeared to him as something more than an incident in the common course of events. For my own part, I have no difficulty to avow that cast of thinking, which by many modern pretenders to wisdom is called <span class="t8">superstitious</span>. But here I think even men of dry rationality may believe, that there was an intermediate interposition of Divine Providence, and that &lsquo;the fervent prayer of this righteous man&rsquo; availed.</p>
<p class="p24">On Sunday, May 9, I found Colonel Valiancy, the celebrated antiquarian and Engineer of Ireland, with him. On Monday, the 10th, I dined with him at Mr. Paradise&rsquo;s, where was a large company; Mr. Bryant, Mr. Joddrel, Mr. Hawkins Browne, &amp;c. On Thursday, the 13th, I dined with him at Mr. Joddrel&rsquo;s, with another large company; the Bishop of Exeter, Lord Monboddo, Mr. Murphy, &amp;c.</p>
<p class="p24">On Saturday, May 15, I dined with him at Dr. Brocklesby&rsquo;s, where were Colonel Vallancy, Mr. Murphy, and that ever-cheerful companion Mr. Devaynes, apothecary to his Majesty. Of these days, and others on which I saw him, I have no memorials, except the general recollection of his being able and animated in conversation, and appearing to relish society as much as the youngest man. I find only these three small particulars: &mdash; When a person was mentioned, who said, &lsquo;I have lived fifty-one years in this world without having had ten minutes of uneasiness;&rsquo; he exclaimed, &lsquo;The man who says so, lies: he attempts to impose on human credulity.&rsquo; The Bishop of Exeter in vain observed, that men were very different. His Lordship&rsquo;s manner was not impressive, and I learnt afterwards that Johnson did not find out that the person who talked to him was a Prelate; if he had, I doubt not that he would have treated him with more respect; for once talking of George Psalmanazar, whom he reverenced for his piety, he said, &lsquo;I should as soon think of contradicting a BISHOP.&rsquo; One of the company provoked him greatly by doing what he could least of all bear, which was quoting something of his own writing, against what he then maintained. &lsquo;What, Sir, (cried the gentleman,) do you say to</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;The busy day, the peaceful night,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfelt, uncounted, glided by845?&rdquo;&rsquo; &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">Johnson finding himself thus presented as giving an instance of a man who had lived without uneasiness, was much offended, for he looked upon such a quotation as unfair. His anger burst out in an unjustifiable retort, insinuating that the gentleman&rsquo;s remark was a sally of ebriety; &lsquo;Sir, there is one passion I would advise you to command: when you have drunk out that glass, don&rsquo;t drink another.&rsquo; Here was exemplified what Goldsmith said of him, with the aid of a very witty image from one of Cibber&rsquo;s Comedies: &lsquo;There is no arguing with Johnson; for if his pistol misses fire, he knocks you down with the butt end of it.&rsquo; Another was this: when a gentleman of eminence in the literary world was violently censured for attacking people by anonymous paragraphs in newspapers; he, from the spirit of contradiction as I thought, took up his defence, and said, &lsquo;Come, come, this is not so terrible a crime; he means only to vex them a little. I do not say that I should do it; but there is a great difference between him and me; what is fit for Hephaestion is not fit for Alexander.&rsquo; Another, when I told him that a young and handsome Countess had said to me, &lsquo;I should think that to be praised by Dr. Johnson would make one a fool all one&rsquo;s life;&rsquo; and that I answered, &lsquo;Madam, I shall make him a fool to-day, by repeating this to him,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;I am too old to be made a fool; but if you say I am made a fool, I shall not deny it. I am much pleased with a compliment, especially from a pretty woman.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On the evening of Saturday, May 15, he was in fine spirits, at our Essex-Head Club. He told us, &lsquo;I dined yesterday at Mrs. Garrick&rsquo;s, with Mrs. Carter, Miss Hannah More, and Miss Fanny Burney. Three such women are not to be found: I know not where I could find a fourth, except Mrs. Lennox, who is superiour to them all.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;What! had you them all to yourself, Sir?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;I had them all as much as they were had; but it might have been better had there been more company there.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Might not Mrs. Montagu have been a fourth?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, Mrs. Montagu does not make a trade of her wit; but Mrs. Montagu is a very extraordinary woman; she has a constant stream of conversation, and it is always impregnated; it has always meaning.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Mr. Burke has a constant stream of conversation.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Yes, Sir; if a man were to go by chance at the same time with Burke under a shed, to shun a shower, he would say&mdash; &ldquo;this is an extraordinary man.&rdquo; If Burke should go into a stable to see his horse drest, the ostler would say &mdash; we have had an extraordinary man here.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;Foote was a man who never failed in conversation. If he had gone into a stable&mdash; &lsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Sir, if he had gone into a stable, the ostler would have said, here has been a comical fellow; but he would not have respected him.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;And, Sir, the ostler would have answered him, would have given him as good as he brought, as the common saying is.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Yes, Sir; and Foote would have answered the ostler. &mdash; When Burke does not descend to be merry, his conversation is very superiour indeed. There is no proportion between the powers which he shews in serious talk and in jocularity. When he lets himself down to that, he is in the kennel.&rsquo; I have in another place opposed, and I hope with success, Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s very singular and erroneous notion as to Mr. Burke&rsquo;s pleasantry. Mr. Windham now said low to me, that he differed from our great friend in this observation; for that Mr. Burke was often very happy in his merriment. It would not have been right for either of us to have contradicted Johnson at this time, in a Society all of whom did not know and value Mr. Burke as much as we did. It might have occasioned something more rough, and at any rate would probably have checked the flow of Johnson&rsquo;s good-humour. He called to us with a sudden air of exultation, as the thought started into his mind, &lsquo;O! Gentlemen, I must tell you a very great thing. The Empress of Russia has ordered the <span class="t8">Rambler</span> to be translated into the Russian language: so I shall be read on the banks of the Wolga. Horace boasts that his fame would extend as far as the banks of the Rhone; now the Wolga is farther from me than the Rhone was from Horace.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;You must certainly be pleased with this, Sir.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;I am pleased Sir, to be sure. A man is pleased to find he has succeeded in that which he has endeavoured to do.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">One of the company mentioned his having seen a noble person driving in his carriage, and looking exceedingly well, notwithstanding his great age. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Ah, Sir; that is nothing. Bacon observes, that a stout healthy old man is like a tower undermined.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Sunday, May 16, I found him alone; he talked of Mrs. Thrale with much concern, saying, &lsquo;Sir, she has done every thing wrong, since Thrale&rsquo;s bridle was off her neck;&rsquo; and was proceeding to mention some circumstances which have since been the subject of publick discussion, when he was interrupted by the arrival of Dr. Douglas, now Bishop of Salisbury.</p>
<p class="p24">Dr. Douglas, upon this occasion, refuted a mistaken notion which is very common in Scotland, that the ecclesiastical discipline of the Church of England, though duly enforced, is insufficient to preserve the morals of the clergy, inasmuch as all delinquents may be screened by appealing to the Convocation, which being never authorized by the King to sit for the dispatch of business, the appeal never can be heard. Dr. Douglas observed, that this was founded upon ignorance; for that the Bishops have sufficient power to maintain discipline, and that the sitting of the Convocation was wholly immaterial in this respect, it being not a Court of judicature, but like a parliament, to make Canons and regulations as times may require.</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson, talking of the fear of death, said, &lsquo;Some people are not afraid, because they look upon salvation as the effect of an absolute decree, and think they feel in themselves the marks of sanctification. Others, and those the most rational in my opinion, look upon salvation as conditional; and as they never can be sure that they have complied with the conditions, they are afraid.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">In one of his little manuscript diaries, about this time, I find a short notice, which marks his amiable disposition more certainly than a thousand studied declarations.&mdash; &lsquo;Afternoon spent cheerfully and elegantly, I hope without offence to GOD or man; though in no holy duty, yet in the general exercise and cultivation of benevolence.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Monday, May 17, I dined with him at Mr. Dilly&rsquo;s, where were Colonel Valiancy, the Reverend Dr. Gibbons, and Mr. Capel Lofft, who, though a most zealous Whig, has a mind so full of learning and knowledge, and so much exercised in various departments, and withal so much liberality, that the stupendous powers of the literary Goliath, though they did not frighten this little David of popular spirit, could not but excite his admiration. There was also Mr. Braithwaite of the Post-office, that amiable and friendly man, who, with modest and unassuming manners, has associated with many of the wits of the age. Johnson was very quiescent to-day. Perhaps too I was indolent. I find nothing more of him in my notes, but that when I mentioned that I had seen in the King&rsquo;s library sixty-three editions of my favourite <span class="t8">Thomas à Kempis</span>, amongst which it was in eight languages, Latin, German, French, Italian, Spanish, English, Arabick, and Armenian, he said, he thought it unnecessary to collect many editions of a book, which were all the same, except as to the paper and print; he would have the original, and all the translations, and all the editions which had any variations in the text. He approved of the famous collection of editions of <span class="t8">Horace</span> by Douglas, mentioned by Pope, who is said to have had a closet filled with them; and he added, &lsquo;every man should try to collect one book in that manner, and present it to a publick library.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Tuesday, May 18, I saw him for a short time in the morning. I told him that the mob had called out, as the King passed, &lsquo;No Fox &mdash; No Fox,&rsquo; which I did not like. He said, &lsquo;They were right, Sir.&rsquo; I said, I thought not; for it seemed to be making Mr. Fox the King&rsquo;s competitor. There being no audience, so that there could be no triumph in a victory, he fairly agreed with me. I said it might do very well, if explained thus:&mdash; &lsquo;Let us have no Fox;&rsquo; understanding it as a prayer to his Majesty not to appoint that gentleman minister.</p>
<p class="p24">On Wednesday, May 19, I sat a part of the evening with him, by ourselves. I observed, that the death of our friends might be a consolation against the fear of our own dissolution, because we might have more friends in the other world than in this. He perhaps felt this as a reflection upon his apprehension as to death; and said, with heat, &lsquo;How can a man know <span class="t8">where</span> his departed friends are, or whether they will be his friends in the other world? How many friendships have you known formed upon principles of virtue? Most friendships are formed by caprice or by chance, mere confederacies in vice or leagues in folly.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">We talked of our worthy friend Mr. Langton. He said, &lsquo;I know not who will go to Heaven if Langton does not. Sir, I could almost say, <span class="t8">Sit anima mea cum Langtono</span>&rsquo; I mentioned a very eminent friend a virtuous man. JOHNSON. &lsquo;Yes, Sir; but &mdash;&mdash; has not the evangelical virtue of Langton. &mdash;&mdash; , I am afraid, would not scruple to pick up a wench.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He however charged Mr. Langton with what he thought want of judgement upon an interesting occasion. &lsquo;When I was ill, (said he) I desired he would tell me sincerely in what he thought my life was faulty. Sir, he brought me a sheet of paper, on which he had written down several texts of Scripture, recommending christian charity. And when I questioned him what occasion I had given for such an animadversion, all that he could say amounted to this, &mdash; that I sometimes contradicted people in conversation. Now what harm does it do to any man to be contradicted?&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;I suppose he meant the <span class="t8">manner</span> of doing it; roughly, &mdash; and harshly.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;And who is the worse for that?&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;It hurts people of weak nerves.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;I know no such weak-nerved people.&rsquo; Mr. Burke, to whom I related this conference, said, &lsquo;It is well, if when a man comes to die, he has nothing heavier upon his conscience than having been a little rough in conversation.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Johnson, at the time when the paper was presented to him, though at first pleased with the attention of his friend, whom he thanked in an earnest manner, soon exclaimed, in a loud and angry tone, &lsquo;What is your drift, Sir?&rsquo; Sir Joshua Reynolds pleasantly observed, that it was a scene for a comedy, to see a penitent get into a violent passion and belabour his confessor.</p>
<p class="p24">I have preserved no more of his conversation at the times when I saw him during the rest of this month, till Sunday, the 30th of May, when I met him in the evening at Mr. Hoole&rsquo;s, where there was a large company both of ladies and gentlemen; Sir James Johnston happened to say, that he paid no regard to the arguments of counsel at the bar of the House of Commons, because they were paid for speaking. &lsquo;JOHNSON. &lsquo;Nay, Sir, argument is argument. You cannot help paying regard to their arguments, if they are good. If it were testimony, you might disregard it, if you knew that it were purchased. There is a beautiful image in Bacon upon this subject: testimony is like an arrow shot from a long bow; the force of it depends on the strength of the hand that draws it. Argument is like an arrow from a cross-bow, which has equal force though shot by a child.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He had dined that day at Mr. Hoole&rsquo;s, and Miss Helen Maria Williams being expected in the evening, Mr. Hoole put into his hands her beautiful <span class="t8">Ode on the Peace</span>: Johnson read it over, and when this elegant and accomplished young lady was presented to him, he took her by the hand in the most courteous manner, and repeated the finest stanza of her poem; this was the most delicate and pleasing compliment he could pay. Her respectable friend, Dr. Kippis, from whom I had this anecdote, was standing by, and was not a little gratified.</p>
<p class="p24">Miss Williams told me, that the only other time she was fortunate enough to be in Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s company, he asked her to sit down by him, which she did, and upon her enquiring how he was, he answered, &lsquo;I am very ill indeed, Madam. I am very ill even when you are near me; what should I be were you at a distance?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He had now a great desire to go to Oxford, as his first jaunt after his illness; we talked of it for some days, and I had promised to accompany him. He was impatient, and fretful to-night, because I did not at once agree to go with him on Thursday. When I considered how ill he had been, and what allowance should be made for the influence of sickness upon his temper, I resolved to indulge him, though with some inconvenience to myself, as I wished to attend the musical meeting in honour of Handel, in Westminster-Abbey, on the following Saturday.</p>
<p class="p24">In the midst of his own diseases and pains, he was ever compassionate to the distresses of others, and actively earnest in procuring them aid, as appears from a note to Sir Joshua Reynolds, of June, in these words:&mdash; &lsquo;I am ashamed to ask for some relief for a poor man, to whom, I hope, I have given what I can be expected to spare. The man importunes me, and the blow goes round. I am going to try another air on Thursday.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">On Thursday, June 3, the Oxford post-coach took us up in the morning at Bolt-court. The other two passengers were Mrs. Beresford and her daughter, two very agreeable ladies from America; they were going to Worcestershire, where they then resided. Frank had been sent by his master the day before to take places for us; and I found, from the way-bill, that Dr. Johnson had made our names be put down. Mrs. Beresford, who had read it, whispered me, &lsquo;Is this the great Dr. Johnson?&rsquo; I told her it was; so she was then prepared to listen. As she soon happened to mention in a voice so low that Johnson did not hear it, that her husband had been a member of the American Congress, I cautioned her to beware of introducing that subject, as she must know how very violent Johnson was against the people of that country. He talked a great deal, but I am sorry I have preserved little of the conversation. Miss Beresford was so much charmed, that she said to me aside, &lsquo;How he does talk! Every sentence is an essay.&rsquo; She amused herself in the coach with knotting; he would scarcely allow this species of employment any merit. &lsquo;Next to mere idleness (said he) I think knotting is to be reckoned in the scale of insignificance; though I once attempted to learn knotting. Dempster&rsquo;s sister (looking to me) endeavoured to teach me it; but I made no progress.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I was surprised at his talking without reserve in the publick post-coach of the state of his affairs; &lsquo;I have (said he) about the world I think above a thousand pounds, which I intend shall afford Frank an annuity of seventy pounds a year.&rsquo; Indeed his openness with people at a first interview was remarkable. He said once to Mr. Langton, &lsquo;I think I am like Squire Richard in <span class="t8">The Journey to London, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m never strange in a strange place</span>.&rdquo;&rsquo; He was truly <span class="t8">social</span>. He strongly censured what is much too common in England among persons of condition, &mdash; maintaining an absolute silence, when unknown to each other; as for instance, when occasionally brought together in a room before the master or mistress of the house has appeared. &lsquo;Sir, that is being so uncivilised as not to understand the common rights of humanity.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">At the inn where we stopped he was exceedingly dissatisfied with some roast mutton which we had for dinner. The ladies I saw wondered to see the great philosopher, whose wisdom and wit they had been admiring all the way, get into ill-humour from such a cause. He scolded the waiter, saying, &lsquo;It is as bad as bad can be: it is ill-fed, ill-killed, ill-kept, and ill-drest.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He bore the journey very well, and seemed to feel himself elevated as he approached Oxford, that magnificent and venerable seat of learning, Orthodoxy, and Toryism. Frank came in the heavy coach, in readiness to attend him; and we were received with the most polite hospitality at the house of his old friend Dr. Adams, Master of Pembroke College, who had given us a kind invitation. Before we were set down, I communicated to Johnson, my having engaged to return to London directly, for the reason I have mentioned, but that I would hasten back to him again. He was pleased that I had made this journey merely to keep him company. He was easy and placid, with Dr. Adams, Mrs. and Miss Adams, and Mrs. Kennicot, widow of the learned Hebraean, who was here on a visit. He soon dispatched the inquiries which were made about his illness and recovery, by a short and distinct narrative; and then assuming a gay air, repeated from Swift, &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Nor think on our approaching ills,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And talk of spectacles and pills880.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Dr. Newton, the Bishop of Bristol, having been mentioned, Johnson, recollecting the manner in which he had been censured by that Prelate, thus retaliated:-&rsquo; Tom knew he should be dead before what he has said of me would appear. He durst not have printed it while he was alive.&rsquo; DR. ADAMS. &lsquo;I believe his <span class="t8">Dissertations on the Prophecies</span> is his great work.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why, Sir, it is Tom&rsquo;s great work; but how far it is great, or how much of it is Tom&rsquo;s, are other questions. I fancy a considerable part of it was borrowed.&rsquo; DR. ADAMS. &lsquo;He was a very successful man.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think so, Sir. He did not get very high. He was late in getting what he did get; and he did not get it by the best means. I believe he was a gross flatterer.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I fulfilled my intention by going to London, and returned to Oxford on Wednesday the 9th of June, when I was happy to find myself again in the same agreeable circle at Pembroke College, with the comfortable prospect of making some stay. Johnson welcomed my return with more than ordinary glee.</p>
<p class="p24">He talked with great regard of the Honourable Archibald Campbell, whose character he had given at the Duke of Argyll&rsquo;s table, when we were at Inverary; and at this time wrote out for me, in his own hand, a fuller account of that learned and venerable writer, which I have published in its proper place. Johnson made a remark this evening which struck me a good deal. &lsquo;I never (said he) knew a non-juror who could reason.&rsquo; Surely he did not mean to deny that faculty to many of their writers; to Hickes, Brett, and other eminent divines of that persuasion; and did not recollect that the seven Bishops, so justly celebrated for their magnanimous resistance of arbitrary power, were yet Nonjurors to the new Government. The nonjuring clergy of Scotland, indeed, who, excepting a few, have lately, by a sudden stroke, cut off all ties of allegiance to the house of Stuart, and resolved to pray for our present lawful Sovereign by name, may be thought to have confirmed this remark; as it may be said, that the divine indefeasible hereditary right which they professed to believe, if ever true, must be equally true still. Many of my readers will be surprized when I mention, that Johnson assured me he had never in his life been in a nonjuring meeting-house.</p>
<p class="p24">Next morning at breakfast, he pointed out a passage in Savage&rsquo;s <span class="t8">Wanderer</span>, saying, &lsquo;These are fine verses.&rsquo; &lsquo;If (said he) I had written with hostility of Warburton in my <span class="t8">Shakspeare</span>, I should have quoted this couplet: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Here Learning, blinded first and then beguil&rsquo;d,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looks dark as Ignorance, as Fancy wild888.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">You see they&rsquo;d have fitted him to a <span class="t8">T</span>,&rsquo; (smiling.) DR. ADAMS. &lsquo;But you did not write against Warburton.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;No, Sir, I treated him with great respect both in my Preface and in my Notes.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Mrs. Kennicot spoke of her brother, the Reverend Mr. Chamberlayne, who had given up great prospects in the Church of England on his conversion to the Roman Catholick faith. Johnson, who warmly admired every man who acted from a conscientious regard to principle, erroneous or not, exclaimed fervently, &lsquo;GOD bless him.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Mrs. Kennicot, in confirmation of Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s opinion, that the present was not worse than former ages, mentioned that her brother assured her, there was now less infidelity on the Continent than there had been; Voltaire and Rousseau were less read. I asserted, from good authority, that Hume&rsquo;s infidelity was certainly less read. JOHNSON. &lsquo;All infidel writers drop into oblivion, when personal connections and the floridness of novelty are gone; though now and then a foolish fellow, who thinks he can be witty upon them, may bring them again into notice. There will sometimes start up a College joker, who does not consider that what is a joke in a College will not do in the world. To such defenders of Religion I would apply a stanza of a poem which I remember to have seen in some old collection: &mdash; </p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Henceforth be quiet and agree,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each kiss his empty brother;</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Religion scorns a foe like thee,</p>
<p class="p24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But dreads a friend like t&rsquo;other.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p24">The point is well, though the expression is not correct; <span class="t8">one</span>, and not <span class="t8">thee, should be opposed to</span> t&rsquo;other<span class="t8">.&rsquo;</span></p>
<p class="p24">On the Roman Catholick religion he said, &lsquo;If you join the Papists externally, they will not interrogate you strictly as to your belief in their tenets. No reasoning Papist believes every article of their faith. There is one side on which a good man might be persuaded to embrace it. A good man of a timorous disposition, in great doubt of his acceptance with GOD, and pretty credulous, might be glad to be of a church where there, are so many helps to get to Heaven. I would be a Papist if I could. I have fear enough; but an obstinate rationality prevents me. I shall never be a Papist, unless on the near approach of death, of which I have a very great terrour. I wonder that women are not all Papists.&rsquo; BOSWELL. &lsquo;They are not more afraid of death than men are.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Because they are less wicked.&rsquo; DR. ADAMS. &lsquo;They are more pious.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;No, hang &lsquo;em, they are not more pious. A wicked fellow is the most pious when he takes to it. He&rsquo;ll beat you all at piety.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">He argued in defence of some of the peculiar tenets of the Church of Rome. As to the giving the bread only to the laity, he said, &lsquo;They may think, that in what is merely ritual, deviations from the primitive mode may be admitted on the ground of convenience, and I think they are as well warranted to make this alteration, as we are to substitute sprinkling in the room of the ancient baptism.&rsquo; As to the invocation of saints, he said, &lsquo;Though I do not think it authorised, it appears to me, that &ldquo;the communion of saints&rdquo; in the Creed means the communion with the saints in Heaven, as connected with &ldquo;The holy Catholick Church.&rdquo;&rsquo; He admitted the influence of evil spirits upon our minds, and said, &lsquo;Nobody who believes the New Testament can deny it.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I brought a volume of Dr. Hurd the Bishop of Worcester&rsquo;s Sermons<span class="t8">, and read to the company some passages from one of them, upon this text, &lsquo;</span>Resist the Devil, and he will fly from you.&rsquo; James<span class="t8">, iv. 7. I was happy to produce so judicious and elegant a supporter of a doctrine, which, I know not why, should, in this world of imperfect knowledge, and, therefore, of wonder and mystery in a thousand instances, be contested by some with an unthinking assurance and flippancy.</span></p>
<p class="p24">After dinner, when one of us talked of there being a great enmity between Whig and Tory; &mdash; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Why not so much, I think, unless when they come into competition with each other. There is none when they are only common acquaintance, none when they are of different sexes. A Tory will marry into a Whig family, and a Whig into a Tory family, without any reluctance. But indeed, in a matter of much more concern than political tenets, and that is religion, men and women do not concern themselves much about difference of opinion; and ladies set no value on the moral character of men who pay their addresses to them; the greatest profligate will be as well received as the man of the greatest virtue, and this by a very good woman, by a woman who says her prayers three times a day.&rsquo; Our ladies endeavoured to defend their sex from this charge; but he roared them down! &lsquo;No, no, a lady will take Jonathan Wild as readily as St. Austin, if he has three-pence more; and, what is worse, her parents will give her to him. Women have a perpetual envy of our vices; they are less vicious than we, not from choice, but because we restrict them; they are the slaves of order and fashion; their virtue is of more consequence to us than our own, so far as concerns this world.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Miss Adams mentioned a gentleman of licentious character, and said, &lsquo;Suppose I had a mind to marry that gentleman, would my parents consent?&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Yes, they&rsquo;d consent, and you&rsquo;d go. You&rsquo;d go though they did not consent.&rsquo; MISS ADAMS. &lsquo;Perhaps their opposing might make me go.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;O, very well; you&rsquo;d take one whom you think a bad man, to have the pleasure of vexing your parents. You put me in mind of Dr. Barrowby, the physician, who was very fond of swine&rsquo;s flesh. One day, when he was eating it, he said, &lsquo;I wish I was a Jew.&rsquo; &lsquo;Why so? (said somebody); the Jews are not allowed to eat your favourite meat.&rsquo; &lsquo;Because, (said he,) I should then have the gust of eating it, with the pleasure of sinning.&rsquo; Johnson then proceeded in his declamation.</p>
<p class="p24">Miss Adams soon afterwards made an observation that I do not recollect, which pleased him much: he said with a good-humoured smile, &lsquo;That there should be so much excellence united with so much depravity<span class="t8">, is strange.&rsquo;</span></p>
<p class="p24">Indeed, this lady&rsquo;s good qualities, merit, and accomplishments, and her constant attention to Dr. Johnson, were not lost upon him. She happened to tell him that a little coffee-pot, in which she had made his coffee, was the only thing she could call her own. He turned to her with a complacent gallantry, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t say so, my dear; I hope you don&rsquo;t reckon my heart as nothing.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">I asked him if it was true as reported, that he had said lately, &lsquo;I am for the King against Fox; but I am for Fox against Pitt.&rsquo; JOHNSON. &lsquo;Yes, Sir; the King is my master; but I do not know Pitt; and Fox is my friend.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">&lsquo;Fox, (added he,) is a most extraordinary man; here is a man (describing him in strong terms of objection in some respects according as he apprehended, but which exalted his abilities the more) who has divided the Kingdom with Caesar; so that it, was a doubt whether the nation should be ruled by the sceptre of George the Third, or the tongue of Fox.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p24">Dr. Wall, physician at Oxford, drank tea with us. Johnson had in general a peculiar pleasure in the company of physicians, which was certainly not abated by the conversation of this learned, ingenious, and pleasing gentleman. Johnson said, &lsquo;It is wonderful how little good Radcliffe&rsquo;s travelling fellowships have done. I know nothing that has been imported by them; yet many additions to our medical knowledge might be got in foreign countries. Inoculation, for instance, has saved more lives than war destroys: and the cures performed by the Peruvian-bark are innumerable. But it is in vain to send our travelling physicians to France, and Italy, and Germany, for all that is known there is known here; I&rsquo;d send them out of Christendom; I&rsquo;d send them among barbarous nations.&rsquo;</p>
