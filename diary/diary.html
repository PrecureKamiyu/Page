		<p>What should be contained in the diary? I don't know. But I think that one takes diary to
		write thing that happened in that day. It is indeed useless to just write down things so daily.
		Does meaning just emerge from such behavior?</p>
		<h2>Ways to Learn</h2>
		<p>Things get easy if you want to read great books. As for me, I would like to get a perspective into the subject, after which further reading is done. The pattern suits for me because reading books may seem so difficult for me if I am not familiar with the subject.</p>
		<h2>Books</h2>
		<p>I went to a book store. But the most interesting book I found is <em>Introduction to random process with application</em> by Sheldon Ross, which also was priced at <b>179</b> rmb. I can't afford it.</p>
		<p>And I also found that the typesetting of the book sucks.</p>
		<h2>Sex and Power and Pegging</h2>
		<p>The relationship of <em>sex</em> and <em>power</em> is so intriguing. Do you know pegging? I think pegging is the very thing that reflects the relationship of sex and power. One (a woman) is thirsty for this reversion of the power which, in some people's view is the just the rebel against power. However, this exact behavior reflects that everyone is so constrained by the power.</p>
		<h2>E-books</h2>
		<p>Reading e-books can be suffering. Devices are important. But I can't afford a good device.</p>
