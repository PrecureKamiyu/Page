The sources may store the data under diﬀerent schemas. For performance reasons (as well as for reasons of organization control), the data sources usually will not permit other parts of the company to retrieve data on demand.</p><p style="padding-left: 119pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">Organizations therefore typically gather data from multiple sources into one lo- cation, referred to as a <i>data warehouse</i>. Data warehouses gather data from multiple sources at a single site, under a uniﬁed schema (which is usually designed to support eﬃcient analysis, even at the cost of redundant storage). Thus, they provide the user</p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 119pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;">519</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 88pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">a single uniform interface to data. However, data warehouses today also collect and store data from non-relational sources, where schema uniﬁcation is not possible. Some sources of data have errors that can be detected and corrected using business con- straints; further, organizations may collect data from multiple sources, and there may be duplicates in the data collected from diﬀerent sources. These steps of collecting data, cleaning/deduplicating the data, and loading the data into a warehouse are re- ferred to as <i>extract, transform and load </i>(<span class="s44">ETL</span>) tasks. We study issues in building and maintaining a data warehouse in Section 11.2.</p><p style="padding-left: 88pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">The most basic form of analytics is generation of aggregates and reports summa- rizing the data in ways that are meaningful to the organization. Analysts need to get a number of diﬀerent aggregates and compare them to understand patterns in the data. Aggregates, and in some cases the underlying data, are typically presented graphically as charts, to make it easy for humans to visualize the data. Dashboards that display charts summarizing key organizational parameters, such as sales, expenses, product returns, and so forth, are popular means of monitoring the health of an organization. Analysts also need to visualize data in ways that can highlight anomalies or give insights into causes for changes in the business.</p><p style="padding-left: 88pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">Systems that support very eﬃcient analysis, where aggregate queries on large data are answered in almost real time (as opposed to being answered after tens of minutes or multiple hours) are popular with analysts. Such systems are referred to as <i>online analyti- cal processing </i>(<span class="s44">OLAP</span>) systems. We discuss online analytical processing in Section 11.3, where we cover the concept of multidimensional data, <span class="s44">OLAP </span>operations, relational rep- resentation of multidimensional summaries. We also discuss graphical representation of data and visualization in Section 11.3.</p><p style="padding-left: 88pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">Statistical analysis is an important part of data analysis. There are several tools that are designed for statistical analysis, including the R language/environment, which is open source, and commercial systems such as <span class="s44">SAS </span>and <span class="s44">SPSS</span>. The R language is widely used today, and in addition to features for statistical analysis, it supports facilities for graphical display of data. A large number of R packages (libraries) are available that implement a wide variety of data analysis tasks, including many machine-learning algorithms. R has been integrated with databases as well as with Big Data systems such as Apache Spark, which allows R programs to be executed in parallel on large datasets. Statistical analysis is a large area by itself, and we do not discuss it further in this book. References providing more information may be found in the Further Reading section at the end of this chapter.</p><p style="padding-left: 88pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">Prediction of diﬀerent forms is another key aspect of analytics. For example, banks need to decide whether to give a loan to a loan applicant, and online advertisers need to decide which advertisement to show to a particular user. As another example, man- ufacturers and retailers need to make decisions on what items to manufacture or order in what quantities.</p><p style="padding-left: 88pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">These decisions are driven signiﬁcantly by techniques for analyzing past data and using the past to predict the future. For example, the risk of loan default can be pre- dicted as follows. First, the bank would examine the loan default history of past cus-</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 119pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark230">tomers, ﬁnd key features of customers, such as salary, education level, job history, and so on, that help in prediction of loan default. The bank would then build a prediction model (such as a decision tree, which we study later in this chapter) using the chosen features. When a customer then applies for a loan, the features of that particular cus- tomer are fed into the model which makes a prediction, such as an estimated likelihood of loan default. The prediction is used to make business decisions, such as whether to give a loan to the customer.</a><a name="bookmark247">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="padding-left: 119pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">Similarly, analysts may look at the past history of sales and use it to predict future sales, to make decisions on what and how much to manufacture or order, or how to target their advertising. For example, a car company may search for customer attributes that help predict who buys diﬀerent types of cars. It may ﬁnd that most of its small sports cars are bought by young women whose annual incomes are above $50,000. The company may then target its marketing to attract more such women to buy its small sports cars and may avoid wasting money trying to attract other categories of people to buy those cars.</p><p style="padding-left: 119pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">Machine-learning techniques are key to ﬁnding patterns in data and in making pre- dictions from these patterns. The ﬁeld of <i>data mining </i>combines knowledge-discovery techniques invented by machine-learning researchers with eﬃcient implementation techniques that enable them to be used on extremely large databases. Section 11.4 discusses data mining.</p><p style="padding-left: 119pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">The term <span class="s63">business intelligence </span>(<span class="s64">BI</span>) is used in a broadly similar sense to data an- alytics. The term <span class="s63">decision support </span>is also used in a related but narrower sense, with a focus on reporting and aggregation, but not including machine learning/data min- ing. Decision-support tasks typically use <span class="s44">SQL </span>queries to process large amounts of data. Decision-support queries are can be contrasted with queries for <i>online transaction pro- cessing</i>, where each query typically reads only a small amount of data and may perform a few small updates.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part217.htm">&lt; 上一个</a><span> | </span><a href="../database.html">内容</a><span> | </span><a href="part219.htm">下一个 &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
