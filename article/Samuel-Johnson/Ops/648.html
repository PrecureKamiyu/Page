<p class="p21">This was the first major biography published by Johnson, which was released anonymously in 1744 and concerns the life of a London poet and friend of the author, who had died the previous year. The biography contains many details of Savage&rsquo;s account of his own life, including claims that he was the illegitimate child of a noble family that quickly disowned and abandoned him at birth. The biography was later included in Johnson&rsquo;s <span class="t8">The Lives of the Poets</span>, published in 1779, and the Savage biography is attributed as one of the important steps for Johnson becoming a prominent biographer in his later years. The book was well received and was the first source of early praise for Johnson. </p>
<p class="p22">Richard Savage had led a controversial life and Johnson used the material to try to answer some wider ethical questions. Savage was both a poet and a playwright and Johnson was reported to have enjoyed spending time and discussing various topics with him, along with drinking and other merriment. However, Savage was encouraged by his friends to move to Bristol and improve his lifestyle. He was unable to accomplish this and was eventually sent to a debtor&rsquo;s prison, where he died in 1743. Edward Cave, Johnson&rsquo;s publisher, encouraged him to put together a life of his friend. Johnson began to collect as many letters and biographical details as he could and, with his extensive history with Savage, produced a thorough biography. Johnson dedicated a large portion of his time to the work and was able to produce &ldquo;forty-eight of the printed octavo pages of the life of Savage at a sitting, but then I sat up all night.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p22">Johnson finished the work just before the Christmas of 1743 and was paid fifteen guineas. After its anonymous publication, the 200 page book was immediately successful, reviving much new interest in Savage&rsquo;s poetry, although the biography was not the financial success that Johnson or Cave had wished for. However, it did open an important area for Johnson to explore as a biographer in his later years.</p>
